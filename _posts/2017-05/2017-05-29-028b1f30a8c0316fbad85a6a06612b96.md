Since Memorial Day in the U.S. is the unofficial start of the summer season, I figured today would be a good time to launch the SUMMER OF DATA SCIENCE 2017!!!

**The Summer of Data Science is a commitment to learn something this summer to enhance your data science skills, and to share what you learned.** (Those of you in the Southern Hemisphere will have to pick up the excitement when we’re winding down during our fall/your spring and keep it going! Or, join us during your Winter of Data Science!)

For those of you who haven’t been following me for years, a hashtag I started back in 2015, #SoDS, is actually one of the things that started growing my twitter following. Here’s the history:

[Coming up with the hashtag](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/05/18/summer-of-data-science-2015)

[1st month of tweets, May 2015 Storified](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/09/may-2015-sods-storify)

[June 2015 #SoDS Storify](https://storify.com/BecomingDataSci/sods-june-2015)

Unfortunately, I didn’t keep up the ‘Storification’ after that, but you get the idea. It brought a bunch of us together to share our learning progress. We learned from each other, encouraged each other, and most of all geeked out about data science together!

I didn’t launch one last year, because I was starting a new job and taking a break from recording the podcast, and just didn’t want to take on too much. But I missed it, so I didn’t want to let another year pass without a Summer of Data Science, so we’re going to do it together again this year!

So, here are the only “rules”:

> How to participate in the Summer of Data Science:

- Pick a thing or a short list of things related to data science that you want to learn more about this summer.
- Make a plan to learn it (like an online course, a practice project, etc.).
- Share that plan on social media, then post updates as you make progress, with the hashtag #SoDS17.



That’s it! (And yes, there’s a chef competition that used the same hashtag. No worries! Enjoy the food pics.) 

If you’re looking for ideas for learning projects or topics, check out the [Data Science Learning Club](http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub)! Please write about your learning experiences and share in the [Data Science Learning Club #SoDS forum](http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-30.html), and/or on your own blog, and share on social media. I’ll check out the hashtag on twitter regularly and RT others. I’ll be participating myself, too!

Here’s a link to the hashtag on twitter: [#SoDS17](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoDS17). See you there!

P.S. Did you know that there is a [“Summer of Data Sci” song](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/08/monday-silliness)? :D

P.P.S. There are now [Summer of Data Science 2017 t-shirts and tanks](https://teespring.com/stores/becoming-a-data-scientist) in the Becoming a Data Scientist teespring shop!

UPDATE: Here is a twitter Moment with a selection of tweets from the #SoDS17 participants this year! (It starts out with a bunch of intro tweets from me, but click through to twitter and keep scrolling!)
