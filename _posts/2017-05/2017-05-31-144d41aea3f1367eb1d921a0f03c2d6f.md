Here is a bit more explanation from the introduction to the exercise document:


The third edition of ***Data Mining Techniques*** by Gordon S.
Linoff and Michael J. A. Berry contains many stories about applying these
techniques to real business data to achieve real business goals, but until now
there has not been an easy way for students to follow along getting their hands
dirty and learning from experience. This supplement fills that gap by providing
suggested exercises along with the data to be mined. 





We have always shied away from including exercises in our
books for several reasons.  One is that
software evolves so rapidly that the exercises can quickly seem
out-of-date.  Another is that we wanted
the freedom to talk about techniques and variations without worrying about
whether they were supported by this or that software package.  Finally, the foundations of data mining do
not require learning a specific package and we did not want software to
distract readers from the principal focus of the book. On the other hand, there
is no substitute for hands-on work with real data for truly mastering data
mining techniques. The solution is to publish a separate document with an
update cycle decoupled from that of ***Data Mining Techniques***.
