](http://www.micfarris.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fortune-Startup-Rising.jpg)I read a couple of items in this month’s Fortune magazine that I thought it was worth passing along.

The first was a small article by Brian Dumaine about the work being done at [Applied Proteomics](http://www.appliedproteomics.com/) to identify cancer before it develops.  At Applied Proteomics, they use mass spectroscopy to capture and catalog 360,000 different pieces of protein found in blood plasma, and then let supercomputers crunch on the data to identify anomalies associated with cancer.  The company has raised $57 million in venture capital and is backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.  You can read the first bit of the article [here](http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/15/technology/applied-proteomics.pr.fortune/index.html).

The second is from the Word Check callout, showing how access to information is making the word a better place:

**wasa: Pronounced [wah-SUH]**

(noun) Arabic slang:  A display of partiality toward a favored person or group without regard for their qualifications.  A system that drives much of life in the Middle East — from getting into a good school to landing a good job.

But on the Internet, there is no *wasa*.

– Adapted from [*Startup Rising: The Entrepreneurial Revolution Remaking the Middle East*](http://www.startuprisingbook.com/) by Christopher M. Schroeder
