Earlier this year at the QCon.ai conference, I gave a short presentation, "The Case for R, for AI developers". I also presented an interactive workshop, using R and the [Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services?WT.mc_id=Revolutions-blog-davidsmi), to automatically generate captions for images, and to create a tool to recognize images of hotdogs. Video from both the presentation, and the workshop (which starts at the 10:00 mark), is [now available to view the QCon.ai website](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/r-framework-ai-apps).

You can [find the slides for the presentation here](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/04/the-case-for-r-for-ai-developers.html). The [R code for the "Not Hotdog" workshop](https://notebooks.azure.com/davidsmi/libraries/qcon) is available as an Azure Notebook which you can clone and use to follow along with the workshop.
