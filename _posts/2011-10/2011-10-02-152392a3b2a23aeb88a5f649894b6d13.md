Last week we released a new version of scikit-learn. The Changelog is
particularly impressive, yet personally this release is important for
other reasons. This will probably be my last release as a paid engineer.
I'm starting a PhD next month, and although I plan to continue
contributing to the project and make a few more releases, I will
certainly have less time to devote to it. Luckily, I received a lot of
help from the community while preparing the release, from Changelog
writing to build of Windows binaries, thus I expect the transition to go
smoothly. Almost two years have elapsed since the first 0.1 release.
During this time, we did a lot of refactoring and broke the API several
times. However, I've seen some concerns about API stability both at the
EuroScipy conference and in the mailing list where I’ve realized we need
to provide an API that does not break in every release, and do this in a
way that the project remains fun for developers. That's why I'm
extremely glad to see that although this release is big in changes,
these have been made in a more organized manner. Yes, we've broken the
API once again, but now there's a compatibility layer that ensures that
code written for 0.8 will continue working with the new release.
