In scipy's development version there's a new function closely related to
the [QR-decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) of a matrix and to the least-squares solution of
a linear system. What this function does is to compute the
QR-decomposition of a matrix and then multiply the resulting orthogonal
factor by another arbitrary matrix. In pseudocode:

but unlike this naive implementation, qr_multiply is able to do
all this **without** explicitly computing the orthogonal Q matrix,
resulting both in memory and time saving. In the following picture I
measured the memory consumption as a function of time of running this
computation on a 1.000 x 1.000 matrix X and a vector Y (full code can
be found [here](https://gist.github.com/1287168)):

It can be seen that not only qr_multiply is
almost twice as fast as the naive approach, but also that the memory
consumption is significantly reduced, since the orthogonal factor is
never explicitly computed. Credit for implementing the qr_multiply
function goes to [Martin Teichmann](https://github.com/tecki).
