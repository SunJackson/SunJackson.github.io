The logic module is slowly becoming useful. This week I managed to get
some basic inference in propositional logic working. This should be
enough for the assumption sysmtem (although having first-order inference
would be cool). You can pull from my branch:
`` git pull [http://fseoane.net/git/sympy.git](http://fseoane.net/git/sympy.git) logic`` Here are some
examples of what it can do: First, importing and defining our symbols

It works with Symbols just as you would expect

It applies De Morgan Rules automatically

converts to conjuntive normal form (CNF)

Some basic inference:

To be discussed: - I'm not sure if we should override &&, || on Symbol
so that we can do A && B instead of And(A, B). If would make the code
cleaner, but also I don't want to bloat Symbol any more. What do you
think ? I'm very proud of this in the sense that it is a nice clean
module that will hopefully serve as the foundation of the new assumption
system.
