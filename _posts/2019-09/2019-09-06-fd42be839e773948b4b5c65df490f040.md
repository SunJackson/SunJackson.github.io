`tvthemes` v1.0.0 is **finally** on CRAN! After a long summer ofprocrastination, useRConference,soccerviz,etc. and a couple of back-and-forth submissions with CRAN to fix someissues, as of September 3rd you can finally:

```
install.packages("tvthemes")
library(tvthemes)

```

My first CRAN package!

If this is your first time coming across {tvthemes} then you can readthe intro blog posthere.Although this new version has been out for a bit more than a month onGitHub, in the past week or so there has been more changes related todocumentation, examples, and code. However, I’ll start off with the mainadditions of interest, new palettes and themes!

## The One True King and Some Other Houses

Let’s start with the new additions to the `Palettes of Ice & Fire`. WhenI first created the palettes for the great houses of Westeros Iimmediately ran into the problem of there being so many houses that usedsimilar color schemes. Namely, the combinations of red, black, andyellow/orange used in varying quantities by House Lannister, HouseTargaryen, House Martell, and House Baratheon of Dragonstone. Originally I just ran away from the problem by omitting House Martell and House Baratheon of Dragonstone but I came back to it mainly because I’m a huge Stannis fan. It’s definitely not perfect and there’s still some overlap but I tried to focus more on browns and oranges for Martell while Stannis got more brighter versions of the orange and red colors.

I’m pretty happy with the line-up for the Westerosi houses although Imay add House Bolton and House Dayne later on. A RGB color-distance toolmay help in having less problems with similar looking palettes in thefuture. (Stannis: fewer problems…)

## Kim Possible

This was a really fun one to work on due to the great color/stylediversity seen across the characters. I’m especially a fan of Shego’slime-green and Doctor Drakken’s midnight-blue/navy-ish colored outfits.Paired against Kim’s orange-red hair and khaki cargo pants color withRon’s burgundy jersey and dark blue shirt it makes for a great palette ofcolors!

```
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::kimPossible_palette)

```

Together with the Spongebob theme it makes for a great looking graph!

```
## library(ggplot2)
## library(magrittr)

## library(extrafont)
## loadfonts(quiet = TRUE)

data <- gapminder::gapminder %>%

 "Japan", "Norway", "Belarus", "United Kingdom",
 "Peru", "Spain")) %>% 
 mutate(year = as.Date(paste(year, "-01-01", sep = "", format = '%Y-%b-%d')))

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, fill = country)) +

## Hilda

Hilda is actually aTV show that was recommended to me in the comments section of the Redditpost of my first `tvthemes` blog post. You might know the voice actressfor the main character, Bella Ramsey, who played Lyanna Mormont in Gameof Thrones. After Googling a few images, I saw how great the colorscheme was and watched a few episodes.

As above, you can see three distinct themes: Day, Dusk, and Night. Theylook fantastic and so I decided to include them for this release! Withsome help from previous attempts by MattShanksand ChevyRay I mixedand combined to create my own versions for each stage of the day.

## Big Hero 6

Most of ya’ll might have seen themovie a couple ofyears ago, but you might not know that they’ve also got an animated TVshow too! It’smore drawn in anime form rather than the 3D form of the movie but itstill retained its charm, humor, and of course the vivid color schemefor our heroes!

## Attack on Titan

Attack on Titan tookthe USA (and the rest of the world) by storm when the first season ofthe anime came out. In light of the subsequent seasons coming outrecently I decided to create a palette too.

```
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::attackOnTitan_palette)

```

## Code Improvements

In addition to the new palettes and themes some of the code in`tvthemes` has changed significantly, but don’t worry most of it wasunder the hood with one major exception. In palettes for example, whenyou are calling the palette functions via `scale_fill_*()` or`scale_color_*()` you now have a lot more options:

- `palette`: This is the **biggest change** in the code for thisrelease. If multiple palettes are available for a TV show, you cannow select the palette: “Stannis”, “FireNation”, “Dusk”, etc. Youcan leave this blank if only single palette available for a certainTV show. This reduces the amount of functions you have to rememberas you only need the one main `scale_*()` function and then theactual palette from the TV show. You can see some examples below.

- `n`: Specifies the number of colors. If left blank it defaults tothe total number of colors available in the palette.

- `type`: Specifies whether you want the palette to be “Discrete” or“Continuous”. **NOTE**: Most palettes are only optimized for“Discrete” at the present time so the “Continuous” option isn’tavailable.

- `reverse`: Specifies (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) whether to reverse the orderof colors.


For TV shows with multiple palettes they are now organized under asingle “palette list” from which you pass the specific palette that youwant. If you want to check out the colors for these specific palettes:

```
## Previously:
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::lannister_palette)
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::brooklyn99_dark_palette)

## Now:
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::westeros_palette$Lannister)
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::brooklyn99_palette$Dark)

```

The specific palettes (fill/color) that changed are:

- **Brooklyn Nine-Nine**: `scale_color_brooklyn99()`; Default =“Regular”, “Dark”

- **Avatar: The Last Airbender**: `scale_color_avatarTLA()`; Default= “FireNation”, “EarthKingdom”, “WaterTribe”, “AirNation”

- **Hilda**: `scale_fill_hilda()`; Default = “Day”, “Dusk”, “Night”

- **Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice & Fire**: `scale_color_westeros()`;Default = “Stark”, “Stannis”, “Tyrell”, “Lannister”, “Manderly”,“Martell”, “Arryn”, “Greyjoy”, “Targaryen”, “Tully”


Some example code:

```
mannis <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_westeros(palette = "Stannis", n = 7, reverse = TRUE) +
 theme_minimal()

yue <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = class)) +
 geom_point(size = 3) +
 scale_color_avatarTLA(palette = "WaterTribe", n = 7, reverse = TRUE) +
 theme_spongeBob()

library(patchwork)

mannis + yue

```

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-09-06-tvthemes-CRAN-announcement_files/newcode-1.png?w=456)


For themes the one change is a toggle option for axis ticks via `ticks`which you can set to either `TRUE` and the default `FALSE`.

```
mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_kimPossible(n = 5, reverse = FALSE) +
 theme_hildaDay(ticks = TRUE)

```

## CRAN Trial(s) and Error(s) and Future Releases

I mentioned in the last {tvthemes} blog post about Jim Hester’svideo on preparing andgoing through with a CRAN release. I tried to emulate him using`usethis::use_release()` but unfortunately it didn’t work as I don’tthink I had the `gh::gh()` credentials set up properly. Instead, I justfollowed along Jim’s video as he checked items off on the Github issueon his screen.

A problem I came up against initially was that I was using the {emo} and{patchwork} packages in the example plots for the README and as youmight know, having packages via “remotes”/GitHub aren’t allowed asdependencies for CRAN packages. So the workaround I had to do was keepthe code but **not** evaluate it (eval=FALSE in the RMD chunk) and addimgur links for the plots so I could delete the packages from the“Suggests” section in the DESCRIPTION.

Some other silly CRAN mistakes that I made:

- The title in DESCRIPTION wasn’t in title case

- Not wrapping names of packages/software/API names with ‘singlequotes’

- Using fully specified URL when including HTML links


The ‘fully specified URL’ thing took me a while to figure out as Iincluded a lot of links throughout the README and it was hard to findwhere a `/` was needed!

I screwed up and had to resubmit quite a number of times but I thinkit’s important to document failures and the bumps along the road aswell. Also, I did add a few more tests but as you can see from the`codecov` badge there wasn’t much added in terms of breadth but more interms of depth!

In terms of function names you’ve all seen by now that they follow thecamelCase style after the initial `theme_` and `scale_*_`. However Irealized that not all the functions follow this styling which is …rather embarrassing on my part. The prime culprits are all the`import_font_*()` functions although I make the excuse that they startedoff as imports of {hrbrthemes}’s font functions and grew out from there.However, one egregious mishap happened with `theme_parksAndRec_light()`which really should be `theme_parksAndRecLight()` instead. As asolution, the former is now deprecated (via a `.Deprecated()` call) infavor of the latter; the original `_light()` version will be deleted inthe next major release, `v2.0.0`.

This mistake had me really thinking hard about the naming conventionsused throughout the package and I will have to make some hard decisionsconcerning whether to keep certain names or even do away with camelCasefor the next major release. For example, I have been thinking aboutchanging `theme_theLastAirbender()` to `theme_avatar()` or something alot shorter and memorable. My original intention was to use ‘Avatar’more prominently in the names but well… for most people that evokes the3D blue aliens from a certain James Cameron film… One thing I am moresure about is changing `scale_*_avatarTLA()` to`scale_*_lastAirbender()` as the current one just seems wonky to type.Ultimately the solution might just be to rename both to use`_lastAirbender()` instead!

Don’t worry though as these changes (if any) won’t be fully implementeduntil the next big version change and I will make sure to deprecate theold functions in the minor releases leading up to `v2.0.0`! If you feelstrongly about any of the above, have any suggestions for new TV shows,or find any bugs then please let me know onGitHub or onTwitter. I hope you enjoy the new CRANversion of {tvthemes}!
