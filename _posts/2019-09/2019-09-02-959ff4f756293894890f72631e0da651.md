A new RcppArmadillo release based on a new Armadillo upstream release arrived on CRAN, and will get to Debian shortly. It brings continued improvements for sparse matrices and a few other things; see below for more details. I also appear to have skipped blogging about the preceding 0.9.600.4.0 release (which was actually extra-rigorous with an unprecedented number of reverse-depends runs) so I included its changes (with very nice sparse matrix improvements) as well.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 656 other packages on CRAN.

Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
