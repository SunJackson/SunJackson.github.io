Our company have been at it again. This time from my colleagues and fellow Data Scientist Alfonso Portabales. 

For this post we look at Draper and Dash’s custom method of highlighting dominant predictors in your machine learning models:

If you are interested in our solutions in healthcare then please contact [email protected]. 

Additionally, we are also available for speaking gigs at conferences to show how we have become a market leader in terms of augmented BI solutions. 

Consulting is something we also do on how to integrate ML with various BI solutions e.g. Tableau, Power BI and Qlik Sense. 

We recently had a really interesting time at the Leeds Data Science meetup – where we discussed how we use our expertise to solve NHS problems: https://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Data-Science-Meetup/events/263675714/.
