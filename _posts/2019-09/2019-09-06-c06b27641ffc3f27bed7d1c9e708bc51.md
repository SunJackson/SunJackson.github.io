rstudio::conf, the conference on all things R and RStudio, will take place January 29 and 30, 2020 in San Francisco, California, preceded by Training Days on January 27 and 28.

We’ve received requests from a number of you for permission to submit talk/e-poster abstracts after the deadline (today, September 6). In response, we’re extending the deadline by a week for everyone; **the new submission deadline is September 13,** a week from today, at 11:59PM PDT. We’ll still notify you of our decision in early October.

See our earlier post for submission guidelines.
