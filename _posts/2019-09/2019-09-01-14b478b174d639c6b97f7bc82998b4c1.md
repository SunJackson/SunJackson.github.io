The ‘ExPanDaR’ package offers a toolbox for interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA). You can read more about it here. The ‘ExPanD’ shiny app allows you to customize your analysis to some extent but often you might want to continue and extend your analysis with additional models and visualizations that are not part of the ‘ExPanDaR’ package.

Thus, I am currently developing an option to export the ‘ExPanD’ data and analysis to an R Notebook. While it is not ready for CRAN yet, it seems to work reasonably well and I would love to see some people trying it and letting me know about any bugs or other issues that they encounter. Hence, this blog post.

In order to test the new export option, you will first need to install the github version of the package.

```
devtools::install_github("joachim-gassen/ExPanDaR")
library(ExPanDaR)
```

The export option is not enabled by default to avoid that users that make the ExPanD app available online accidentally share their data. So, you need to enable it using the parameter `export_nb_option`. Here, I use an ExPanD call using the short firm-year corporate data panel that comes with the ExPanDaR package.

```
ExPanD(df = russell_3000, 
 df_def = russell_3000_data_def, 
 df_name = "Russell 3000",
 config_list = ExPanD_config_russell_3000,
 export_nb_option = TRUE)
```

After ‘ExPanD’ has started, scroll to the bottom of the page to see the “Export Data and Code” button.
