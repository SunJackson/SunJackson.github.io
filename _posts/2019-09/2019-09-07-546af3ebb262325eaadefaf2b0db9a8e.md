We develop a human movement trajectory prediction system that incorporates the scene information (Scene-LSTM) as well as human movement trajectories (Pedestrian movement LSTM) in the prediction process within static crowded scenes. We superimpose a two-level grid structure (scene is divided into grid cells each modeled by a scene-LSTM, which are further divided into smaller sub-grids for finer spatial granularity) and explore common human trajectories occurring in the grid cell (e.g., making a right or left turn onto sidewalks coming out of an alley; or standing still at bus/train stops). Two coupled LSTM networks, Pedestrian movement LSTMs (one per target) and the corresponding Scene-LSTMs (one per grid-cell) are trained simultaneously to predict the next movements. We show that such common path information greatly influences prediction of future movement. We further design a scene data filter that holds important non-linear movement information. The scene data filter allows us to select the relevant parts of the information from the grid cell’s memory relative to a target’s state. We evaluate and compare two versions of our method with the Linear and several existing LSTM-based methods on five crowded video sequences from the UCY [1] and ETH [2] datasets. The results show that our method reduces the location displacement errors compared to related methods and specifically about 80% reduction compared to social interaction methods. … 

**multimodal sparse Bayesian dictionary learning (MSBDL)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

The purpose of this paper is to address the problem of learning dictionaries for multimodal datasets, i.e. datasets collected from multiple data sources. We present an algorithm called multimodal sparse Bayesian dictionary learning (MSBDL). The MSBDL algorithm is able to leverage information from all available data modalities through a joint sparsity constraint on each modality’s sparse codes without restricting the coefficients themselves to be equal. Our framework offers a considerable amount of flexibility to practitioners and addresses many of the shortcomings of existing multimodal dictionary learning approaches. Unlike existing approaches, MSBDL allows the dictionaries for each data modality to have different cardinality. In addition, MSBDL can be used in numerous scenarios, from small datasets to extensive datasets with large dimensionality. MSBDL can also be used in supervised settings and allows for learning multimodal dictionaries concurrently with classifiers for each modality. …

**Protocols and Structures for Inference (PSI)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

The Protocols and Structures for Inference (PSI) project has developed an architecture for presenting machine learning algorithms, their inputs (data) and outputs (predictors) as resource-oriented RESTful web services in order to make machine learning technology accessible to a broader range of people than just machine learning researchers. Currently, many machine learning implementations (e.g., in toolkits such as Weka, Orange, Elefant, Shogun, SciKit.Learn, etc.) are tied to specific choices of programming language, and data sets to particular formats (e.g., CSV, svmlight, ARFF). This limits their accessibility, since new users may have to learn a new programming language to run a learner or write a parser for a new data format, and their interoperability, requiring data format converters and multiple language platforms. While there is also a growing number of machine learning web services, each has its own API and is tailored to suit a different subset of machine learning activities.![](http://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)
