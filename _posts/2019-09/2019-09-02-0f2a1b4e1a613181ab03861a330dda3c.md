**Cambridge Loudness Model** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

The present paper introduces a deep neural network (DNN) for predicting the instantaneous loudness of a sound from its time waveform. The DNN was trained using the output of a more complex model, called the Cambridge loudness model. While a modern PC can perform a few hundred loudness computations per second using the Cambridge loudness model, it can perform more than 100,000 per second using the DNN, allowing real-time calculation of loudness. The root-mean-square deviation between the predictions of instantaneous loudness level using the two models was less than 0.5 phon for unseen types of sound. We think that the general approach of simulating a complex perceptual model by a much faster DNN can be applied to other perceptual models to make them run in real time. …

PyUnfold is a Python package for incorporating imperfections of the measurement process into a data analysis pipeline. In an ideal world, we would have access to the perfect detector: an apparatus that makes no error in measuring a desired quantity. However, in real life, detectors have finite resolutions, characteristic biases that cannot be eliminated, less than full detection efficiencies, and statistical and systematic uncertainties. By building a matrix that encodes a detector’s smearing of the desired true quantity into the measured observable(s), a deconvolution can be performed that provides an estimate of the true variable. This deconvolution process is known as unfolding. The unfolding method implemented in PyUnfold accomplishes this deconvolution via an iterative procedure, providing results based on physical expectations of the desired quantity. Furthermore, tedious book-keeping for both statistical and systematic errors produces precise final uncertainty estimates. … 

**Elastic Architecture Transfer Mechanism for Accelerating Large-Scale Neural Architecture Search (EAT-NAS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed to release human experts from tedious architecture engineering. However, most current methods are constrained in small-scale search due to the issue of computational resources. Meanwhile, directly applying architectures searched on small datasets to large-scale tasks often bears no performance guarantee. This limitation impedes the wide use of NAS on large-scale tasks. To overcome this obstacle, we propose an elastic architecture transfer mechanism for accelerating large-scale neural architecture search (EAT-NAS). In our implementations, architectures are first searched on a small dataset (the width and depth of architectures are taken into consideration as well), e.g., CIFAR-10, and the best is chosen as the basic architecture. Then the whole architecture is transferred with elasticity. We accelerate the search process on a large-scale dataset, e.g., the whole ImageNet dataset, with the help of the basic architecture. What we propose is not only a NAS method but a mechanism for architecture-level transfer. In our experiments, we obtain two final models EATNet-A and EATNet-B that achieve competitive accuracies, 73.8% and 73.7% on ImageNet, respectively, which also surpass the models searched from scratch on ImageNet under the same settings. For computational cost, EAT-NAS takes only less than 5 days on 8 TITAN X GPUs, which is significantly less than the computational consumption of the state-of-the-art large-scale NAS methods. …

We present here, a novel network architecture called MergeNet for discovering small obstacles for on-road scenes in the context of autonomous driving. The basis of the architecture rests on the central consideration of training with less amount of data since the physical setup and the annotation process for small obstacles is hard to scale. For making effective use of the limited data, we propose a multi-stage training procedure involving weight-sharing, separate learning of low and high level features from the RGBD input and a refining stage which learns to fuse the obtained complementary features. The model is trained and evaluated on the Lost and Found dataset and is able to achieve state-of-art results with just 135 images in comparison to the 1000 images used by the previous benchmark. Additionally, we also compare our results with recent methods trained on 6000 images and show that our method achieves comparable performance with only 1000 training samples. …
