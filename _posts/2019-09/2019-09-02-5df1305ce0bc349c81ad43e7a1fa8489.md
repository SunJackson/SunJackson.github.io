I am beyond excited to finally be able to announce a new version of ggraph. Thisrelease, like the ggforce 0.3.0 release, has been many years in the making,laying dormant for long periods first waiting for ggplot2 to get updated andthen waiting for me to have time to finally finish it off. All that is in thepast now as ggraph 2.0.0 has finally landed on CRAN, filled with numerous newfeatures, a massive amount of bug fixes, and a slew of breaking changes.

If you are new to ggraph, a short description follows: It is an extension ofggplot2 that implement an extended grammar for relational data (e.g. trees andnetworks). It provides a huge variety of geoms for drawing nodes and edges,along with an assortment of layouts making it possible to produce a very widerange of network visualization types. It is to my knowledge the most featurepacked network visualization framework available in R (and potentially in otherlanguages as well), all building on top of the familiar ggplot2 API. If you wantto learn more I invite you to browse the newpkgdown website that has been madeavailable.

## New looks

Before we begin with the exiting new stuff, thereâ€™s a small change that may ormay not greet you as you make your first new plot with ggraph v2.0.0. Thedefault look of a ggplot is often not a good fit for network visualisations asthe positional scales are irrelevant. Because of this ggraph has since itsrelease offered a `theme_graph()` that removed a lot of the useless clutter suchas axes and grid lines. You had to use it deliberately though as I didnâ€™t wantto overwrite any defaults you may have had. In the new release Iâ€™ve relaxed onthis a bit. When you construct a ggraph plot it will still use the default themeas a base, but it will remove axes and gridlines from it. This makes it easierto use it together with coorporate templates and the likes right out the box.You can still use `theme_graph()`, or potentially set it as a default using`set_graph_style()` if you so wish.

```
library(ggraph)

# THe new default look:
ggraph(highschool) + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

```
# Using theme_graph for the remainder of this post
set_graph_style(size = 11, plot_margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0))
```

## The broken giraffe

Let us start proper with what this release breaks, because it does it for some verygood reasons and youâ€™ll all be happy about it shortly as you read on. The 1.x.xversions of ggraph worked with two different types of network representations:igraph objects and dendrogram object. Some further types such as hclust andnetwork objects were supported by automatic conversion, but that was it.Further, the internal architecture meant that certain layouts and geoms couldonly be used with certain objects. This was obviously an imperfect situation andone that reflected that tidygraph was developed after ggraph. In ggraph 2.0.0the internals have been rewritten to only be based on tidygraph. This means thatall layouts and geoms will always be available (as long as the topology supportsit). This doesnâ€™t mean that igraph, dendrogram, network, and hclust objects areno longer supported, though. Every input will be attempted to be coerced to atbl_graph object, and as tidygraph supports a wealth of network representations,ggraph can now be used with an even wider selection of objects, all completelywithout any need for change from the user.

While this change was completely internal and thus didnâ€™t break anything, it didput in to question the API of the `ggraph()` function, which had been designedbefore tidy evaluation and tidygraph came into existence. Prior to 2.0.0 alllayout arguments passed into `ggraph()` (and `create_layout()`) would be passedas strings if they referenced any node or edge property, e.g.

```
library(tidygraph)

graph <- as_tbl_graph(
 data.frame(
 from = sample(5, 20, TRUE),
 to = sample(5, 20, TRUE),
 weight = runif(20)
 )
)
```

```
ggraph(graph, layout = 'fr', weights = "weight") + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

With the new API, edge and node parameters are passed along as unquotedexpressions that will be evaluated in the context of the edge or node datarespectively. The example above will this be:

```
ggraph(graph, layout = 'fr', weights = weight) + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


This change might seem superficial and unnecessary until you realize that thismeans the network object doesnâ€™t have to be updated every time you want to trynew edge and node parameters for the layout:

```
ggraph(graph, layout = 'fr', weights = sqrt(weight)) + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

So, thatâ€™s the extent of the breakageâ€¦ Now what does this change allow..?

## Tidygraph inside

The use of tidygraph runs much deeper than simply being used as the internalnetwork representation. ggraph will also register the network object duringcreation and rendering of the plot, meaning that all tidygraph algorithms areavailable as input to layout specs and aesthetic mappings:

```
graph <- as_tbl_graph(highschool)

ggraph(graph, layout = 'fr', weights = centrality_edge_betweenness()) + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality_pagerank(), colour = node_is_center()))
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


It is obvious (at least to me) that this new-found capability will make it mucheasier to experiment and iterate on the visualization, hopefully inspiringusers to try out different settings before settling on a plot.

As discussed above, the tidygraph integration also makes it easy to plot a widevariety of data types directly. Above we first create a tbl_graph from the`highschool` edge-list, but that is strictly not necessary:

```
head(highschool)
```

```
## from to year
## 1 1 14 1957
## 2 1 15 1957
## 3 1 21 1957
## 4 1 54 1957
## 5 1 55 1957
## 6 2 21 1957
```

```
ggraph(highschool, layout = 'kk') + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

Note that even though the input is not a tbl_graph it will be converted to oneso all the tidygraph algorithms are still available during plotting.

To further make it easy to quickly gain an overview over your network data,ggraph gains a `qgraph()` function that inspects you input and automaticallypicks a layout and combination of edge and node geoms. While the return type isa standard ggraph/ggplot object it should not really be used as the basis fora more complicated plot as you have no influence over how the layout and firstcouple of layers are chosen.

```
iris_clust <- hclust(dist(iris[, 1:4]))

qgraph(iris_clust)
```

## Layout galore

ggraph 2.0.0 comes with a huge selection of new layouts, from new algorithms forthe classic node-edge diagram to completely new types such as matrix and(bio)fabric layouts. The biggest addition comes from the integration of thegraphlayouts package byDavid Schoch who has done a tremendous jobin bringing new, high quality, layout algorithms to R. The `'stress'` layoutis the new default as it does a much better job than fruchterman-reingold(`'fr'`). It also includes a sparse version `'sparse_stress'` for large graphsthat are much faster than any of the ones provided by igraph.

```
# Defaults to stress, with a message
ggraph(graph) + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

```
## Using `stress` as default layout
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


There are other layouts from graphlayouts of interest, e.g. the `'backbone'`layout that emphasize community structure, the `'focus'` layout that places allnodes in concentric circle based on their distance to a selected node etc. Iwont show them all here but instead direct you to itsgithub page that describes allits different layouts.

Another type of layout that has become available is the unrooted equal-angle andequal-daylight algorithms for drawing unrooted trees. This type of trees aredifferent than those resulting from e.g. hierarchical clustering in that theydo not contain direction or a specific root node. The tree structure is onlygiven by the branch length. To support this the `'dendrogram'` layout has gaineda length argument that allows the layout to be calculated from branch length:

```
library(ape)
data(bird.families)
# Using the bird.orders dataset from ape
ggraph(bird.families, 'dendrogram', length = length) + 
 geom_edge_elbow()
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


Often the dendrogram layout is a bad choice for unrooted trees, as itimplicitly shows a node as the root and draw everything else according to that.Instead one can choose the `'unrooted'` layout where leafs are attemptedevenly spread across the plane.

```
ggraph(bird.families, 'unrooted', length = length) + 
 geom_edge_link()
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


By default the equal-daylight algorithm is used but it is possible to also getthe simpler, but less well-dispersed equal-angle version as well by setting`daylight = FALSE`.

The new version also brings two new special layouts (special meaningnon-standard): `'matrix'` and `'fabric'`, which, like the `'hive'` layout,brings their own edge and node geoms. The matrix layout places nodes on adiagonal and shows edges by placing points at the horizontal and verticalintersection of the terminal nodes. The selling point of this layout is that itscales better as there is no possibility of edge crossings. On the other handis matrix layouts very dependent on the order in which nodes are placed, and asthe network growth so does the possible ordering of nodes. There exist howevera large range of node ranking algorithm that can be used to provide an effectiveordering and many of these are available in tidygraph. It can take some timegetting used to matrix plots but once you begin to recognize patterns in theplot and how it links to certain topological features of the network, they canbecome quite effective tools:

```
# Create a graph where internal edges in communities are grouped
graph <- create_notable('zachary') %>%
 mutate(group = factor(group_infomap())) %>%
 morph(to_split, group) %>%
 activate(edges) %>%
 mutate(edge_group = as.character(.N()$group[1])) %>%
 unmorph()
```

```
## Warning: `as_quosure()` requires an explicit environment as of rlang 0.3.0.
## Please supply `env`.
## This warning is displayed once per session.
```

```
ggraph(graph, 'matrix', sort.by = node_rank_hclust()) + 
 geom_edge_point(aes(colour = edge_group), mirror = TRUE) + 
 coord_fixed()
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


As can be seen in the example above it is often useful to mirror edges to bothsides of the diagonal to make the patterns stronger. Highly connected nodes areeasily recognizable, without suffering from over-plotting, and by choosing anappropriate ranking algorithm communities are easily visible. In addition to`gemo_edge_point()` ggraph also provides `geom_edge_tile()` for a differentlook.

The fabric layout (originally called biofabric, but I have decided to drop theprefix to indicate it can be used generally), is another layout approach thattries to deal with the problems of over-plotting. It does so by drawing all edgesas evenly spaced vertical lines, and all nodes as evenly spaced horizontallines. As with the matrix layout it is highly dependent on the sorting of nodes,and requires some getting used to. I urge you to give it a chance though,potentially with some help from the website itsinventor has set up:

```
ggraph(graph, 'fabric', sort.by = node_rank_fabric()) + 
 geom_node_range(aes(colour = group), alpha = 0.3) + 
 geom_edge_span(aes(colour = edge_group), end_shape = 'circle') + 
 coord_fixed() + 
 theme(legend.position = 'top')
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


The `node_rank_fabric()` is the ranking proposed in the original paper, butother ranking algorithms are of course also possible.

The last new feature in the layout department is that it is now easier to plugin new layouts. First, by providing a matrix or data.frame to the `layout`argument in `ggraph()` you can quickly provide a fixed position of the nodes.The same can be obtained by providing an `x` and `y` argument to the `'auto'` layout.Second, you can provide a function directly to the `layout` argument. Thefunction must take a tbl_graph as input and return a data.frame or an objectcoercible to one. This means that e.g. layouts defined as physics simulationswith the particles package can be used directly:

```
library(particles)
# Set up simulation
sim <- . %>% simulate() %>% 
 wield(manybody_force) %>% 
 wield(link_force) %>% 
 evolve()

ggraph(graph, sim) + 
 geom_edge_link(colour = 'grey') + 
 geom_node_point(aes(colour = group), size = 3)
```

## Geoms for the people

While ggraph has always included quite a large range of different geoms forshowing nodes and edges, this release has managed to add some more. Mostimportantly, `geom_edge_fan()` has gained a brother in crime for showingmulti-edges. `geom_edge_parallel()` will draw edges as straight lines but, inthe case of multi-edges, will offset them slightly orthogonal to its directionso that there is no overlap. This is a geom best suited for smaller graphs(IMO), but here it can add a very classic look to the plot:

```
small_graph <- create_notable('bull') %>%
 convert(to_directed) %>%
 bind_edges(data.frame(from = c(1, 2, 5, 3), to = c(2, 1, 3, 2)))

ggraph(small_graph, 'stress') + 
 geom_edge_parallel(end_cap = circle(.5), start_cap = circle(.5),
 arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm'), type = 'closed')) + 
 geom_node_point(size = 4)
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


For this edge geom in particular it is often a good idea to use capping to letthem end before they reaches the terminal nodes.

Another edge geom that has become available is `geom_edge_bend()` which is sortof an organic elbow geom:

```
ggraph(iris_clust, 'dendrogram', height = height) + 
 geom_edge_bend()
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

Lastly, in addition to the node and edge geoms shown in the Layout section,`geom_node_voronoi()` has been added. It is a ggraph specific version of`ggforce::geom_voronoi_tile()` that allows you to create a Voronoi tessellationof the nodes and use the resulting tiles to show the nodes. As with the ggforceversion it is possible to constrain the tiles to a specific radius around theedge making it a great way of showing which nodes dominates certain areaswithout any problems with over-plotting.

```
ggraph(graph, 'stress') + 
 geom_node_voronoi(aes(fill = group), max.radius = 0.5, colour = 'white') + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point()
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

A last little thing pertaining to edge geoms is that many have gained a`strength` argument, which controls their level of non-linearity (this isobviously only available for non-linear edges). Setting `strength = 0` willresult in a linear edge, while setting `strength = 1` will give the standardlook. Everything in between is fair game, while everything outside that rangewill look exceptionally weird, probably.

```
ggraph(iris_clust, 'dendrogram', height = height) + 
 geom_edge_bend(alpha = 0.3) + 
 geom_edge_bend(strength = 0.5, alpha = 0.3) + 
 geom_edge_bend(strength = 0.2, alpha = 0.3)
```

```
ggraph(iris_clust, 'dendrogram', height = height) + 
 geom_edge_elbow(alpha = 0.3) + 
 geom_edge_elbow(strength = 0.5, alpha = 0.3) + 
 geom_edge_elbow(strength = 0.2, alpha = 0.3)
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-22-1-giraffe-2-giraffe-go_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

A few geoms have had arguments such as `curvature` or `spread` that have hadsimilar purpose, but those arguments have been deprecated in favor of the sameargument across all (applicable) geoms.

And then one more last thing, but it is really not something new in ggraph. Asyou can use standard geoms for drawing nodes some of the new features in ggforceis of particular interest to ggraph users. The `geom_mark_*()` family inparticular is great for annotating single, or groups of nodes, and going forwardit will be the advised approach:

```
library(ggforce)
ggraph(graph, 'stress') + 
 geom_edge_link() + 
 geom_node_point() + 
 geom_mark_ellipse(aes(x, y, label = 'Group 3', 
 description = 'A very special collection of nodes',
 filter = group == 3))
```

## All the rest

These are the exiting new stuff, but the release also includes numerous bugfixes and small tweaksâ€¦ Far to many to be interesting to list, so you musttake my work for it ðŸ˜„.

As with ggforce I hope that ggraph never goes this long without a release again.Feel free to flood me with feature request after you have played with the newversion and Iâ€™ll do my best to take them on.

Iâ€™ll spend some time on ggplot2 and grid for now, but still plan on taking adevelopment sprint with patchwork with the intend of getting it on CRAN beforethe end of this year.
