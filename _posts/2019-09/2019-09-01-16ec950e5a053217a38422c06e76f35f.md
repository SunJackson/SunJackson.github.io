Image captioning is a challenging task and attracting more and more attention in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and which can be applied to efficient image retrieval, intelligent blind guidance and human-computer interaction, etc. In this paper, we present a survey on advances in image captioning based on Deep Learning methods, including Encoder-Decoder structure, improved methods in Encoder, improved methods in Decoder, and other improvements. Furthermore, we discussed future research directions. Image Captioning based on Deep Learning Methods: A Survey
