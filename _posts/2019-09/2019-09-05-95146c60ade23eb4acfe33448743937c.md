Optimization is key when it comes to getting the most out of your machine learning models. Poorly optimized models take longer to run, require more computing resources and result in higher costs.

In this TensorFlow tutorial, you’ll learn:

The impact of optimizing both operators and entire graphs
How to efficiently organize data in training and testing datasets to minimize data shuffling
How to identify a well-optimized model using Anaconda and ActivePython

Proper optimization saves time and money by reducing the memory utilization, power consumption and latency of your models. Code along with us to see for yourself!
