“Within each business there are many people who possess the knowledge of how data needs to be used for business processes and particularly for how the right data can improve business agility, revenue growth and help meet customer expectations. Such employees are invaluable for examining business data: first, to determine its value in context, and second, to understand how it contributes to intelligence being gathered for the organization.” Julie Hunt ( April 7, 2015 )
