From the simplest of scripts to powering powerful quantum computing -- is there anything that Python can’t do? The power of Python lies in its incredible versatility. That’s why it’s prized by everyone from beginner programmers to data scientists running the most powerful algorithms.

If you’re looking to start programming with Python, one of the best resources available is *Get Programming with Python*. It’s written by Ana Bell, a scientist and lecturer who teaches Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python at MIT. The book is designed especially for beginners, helping you learn to program hands on, step by step, project by project. You’ll learn to make a choose your own adventure game, a card game, a game of tag, and more -- all with Python. It’s the perfect resource for young or new programmers looking to get to grips with the basics of this powerful language.

One of the reasons Python is so popular is that it has a huge number of libraries for data science. But when your Python projects get huge, it can be difficult to scale your operations whilst successfully using multiple libraries. That’s where Dask comes in. Dask is a native parallel analytics tool designed to integrate seamlessly with the libraries you’re already using, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. With Dask you can crunch and work with huge datasets, using the tools you already have. The book *Data Science with Python and Dask* is your guide to using Dask for your data projects without changing the way you work!

Did you know that Python can even be used for quantum computing? *Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q#* demystifies quantum computing, showing you QC fundamentals by creating your own quantum simulator in Python. Combined with Microsoft’s amazing new quantum language Q#, this book teaches you to apply quantum programming techniques to applications like quantum key distribution, and tackle real-world examples such as chemistry simulations and searching unsorted databases.
