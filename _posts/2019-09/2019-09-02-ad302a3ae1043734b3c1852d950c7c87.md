Scanning all new published packages on PyPI I know that the quality is often quite bad. I try to filter out the worst ones and list here the ones which might be worth a look, being followed or inspire you in some way.

• **bp-storage**Helper Library for various Dataset formats. Library to load, augment and different dataset formats for use in machine learning models. Note: The repo is still work in progress, so documentation might not be up to date

• **ml-pipeline**An intuitive, super easy machine learning pipeline framework for transforming DataFrames.

• **nestedtensors**NestedTensors for PyTorch

• **print_chat**Small print tool for implementing chat in the terminal

• **reclib**A Python Library for Recommender System. A python package that provides many recommendation algorithms and let users train and test on their own datasets.

• **shrynk**Using Machine Learning to learn how to Compress

• **pept**A Python library that unifies Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) research, including tracking, simulation, data analysis and visualisation tools.

• **pm4pyamazon**Process Mining for Python – Amazon support

• **rarog**Monitoring utility for machine learning experiments. Rarog is a monitoring utility for machine learning experiments. You may use it as a light-weight alternative for `TensorBoard

• **scigym**SciGym — The OpenAI Gym for Science: A platform for your scientific reinforcement learning problem.

• **seedling**A Synthetic Biology Machine Learning package.

• **tf-quant-finance**High performance Tensorflow library for quantitative finance.

• **trdg**TextRecognitionDataGenerator: A synthetic data generator for text recognition

• **valgrind-parser**The valgrind logs parser. Creates the html report from txt logs.

• **yingbox**Ying’s data science helper functions
