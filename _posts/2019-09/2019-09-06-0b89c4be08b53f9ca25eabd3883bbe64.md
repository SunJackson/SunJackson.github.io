Join us on September 11, where you will you learn the real reasons why so many dashboards fail to satisfy users and organizations; reasons that go far deeper than the visual design on which most dashboard books and courses focus. 

Speaker Nick Desbarats will draw on his extensive experience designing dashboards for more than 50 large organizations to demonstrate how creating a system of purpose-specific displays enables users to quickly get answers to their data-related questions.

When: Sep 11, 2019, 1:45 pm - 4:30 pm ET
