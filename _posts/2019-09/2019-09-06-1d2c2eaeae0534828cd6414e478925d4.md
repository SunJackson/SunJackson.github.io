**Dual Rectified Linear Units (DReLU)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) are widely used in feed-forward neural networks, and in convolutional neural networks in particular. However, they can be rarely found in recurrent neural networks due to the unboundedness and the positive image of the rectified linear activation function. In this paper, we introduce Dual Rectified Linear Units (DReLUs), a novel type of rectified unit that comes with a positive and negative image that is unbounded. We show that we can successfully replace the tanh activation function in the recurrent step of quasi recurrent neural networks. In addition, DReLUs are less prone to the vanishing gradient problem, they are noise robust, and they induce sparse activations. Therefore, we are able to stack up to eight quasi recurrent layers, making it possible to improve the current state-of-the-art in character-level language modeling over architectures based on shallow Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). … 

**Age of Information (AoI)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Age of information (AoI) was introduced in the early 2010s as a notion to characterize the freshness of the knowledge a system has about a process observed remotely. AoI was shown to be a fundamentally novel metric of timeliness, significantly different, to existing ones such as delay and latency. The importance of such a tool is paramount, especially in contexts other than transport of information, since communication takes place also to control, or to compute, or to infer, and not just to reproduce messages of a source. This volume comes to present and discuss the first body of works on AoI and discuss future directions that could yield more challenging and interesting research.![](http://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Information integration (II) (also called deduplication and referential integrity) is the merging of information from heterogeneous sources with differing conceptual, contextual and typographical representations. It is used in data mining and consolidation of data from unstructured or semi-structured resources. Typically, information integration refers to textual representations of knowledge but is sometimes applied to rich-media content. information fusion which is a related term involves the combination of information into a new set of information towards reducing uncertainty. …

Although many scalable event matching algorithms have been proposed to achieve scalability for large-scale content-based networks, content-based publish/subscribe networks (especially for large-scale real time systems) still suffer performance deterioration when subscription scale increases. While subscription aggregation techniques can be useful to reduce the amount of subscription dissemination traffic and the subscription table size by exploiting the similarity among subscriptions, efficient subscription aggregation is not a trivial task to accomplish. Previous research works have proved that it is either a NP-Complete or a co-NP complete problem. In this paper, we propose DLS (Discrete Label Set), a novel subscription representation model, and design algorithms to achieve the mapping from traditional Boolean predicate model to the DLS model. Based on the DLS model, we propose a subscription aggregation algorithm with O(1) time complexity in most cases, and an event matching algorithm with O(1) time complexity. The significant performance improvement is at the cost of memory consumption and controllable false positive rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that these algorithms are inherently scalable and can achieve real time event matching in a large-scale content-based publish/subscribe network. We discuss the tradeoff between memory, false positive rate and partition granules of content space. Experimental results show that proposed algorithms achieve expected performance. With the increasing of computer memory capacity and the dropping of memory price, more and more large-scale real time applications can benefit from our proposed DLS model, such as stock quote distribution, earthquake monitoring, and severe weather alert. …
