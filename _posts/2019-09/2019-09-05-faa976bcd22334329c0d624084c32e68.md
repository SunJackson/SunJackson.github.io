**INtermediate representations for FuturE pRediction (INFER)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

In urban driving scenarios, forecasting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is of paramount importance. While several approaches for the problem have been proposed, the best-performing ones tend to require extremely detailed input representations (eg. image sequences). But, such methods do not generalize to datasets they have not been trained on. We propose intermediate representations that are particularly well-suited for future prediction. As opposed to using texture (color) information, we rely on semantics and train an autoregressive model to accurately predict future trajectories of traffic participants (vehicles) (see fig. above). We demonstrate that using semantics provides a significant boost over techniques that operate over raw pixel intensities/disparities. Uncharacteristic of state-of-the-art approaches, our representations and models generalize to completely different datasets, collected across several cities, and also across countries where people drive on opposite sides of the road (left-handed vs right-handed driving). Additionally, we demonstrate an application of our approach in multi-object tracking (data association). To foster further research in transferrable representations and ensure reproducibility, we release all our code and data. …

Thiessen polygon’s are an extreme case – we assume homogeneity within the polygons and abrupt changes at the borders This is unlikely to be correct – for example, precipitation or population totals don’t have abrupt changes at arbitrary borders Tobler developed pycnophylactic interpolation to overcome this problem. Here, values are reassigned by mass-preserving reallocation. The basic principle is that the volume of the attribute within a region remains the same. However, it is assumed that a better representation of the variation is a smooth surface. The volume (the sum within each region) remains constant, whilst the surface becomes smoother. The solution is iterative – the stopping point is arbitrary. …

Social media corpora pose unique challenges and opportunities, including typically short document lengths and rich meta-data such as author characteristics and relationships. This creates great potential for systematic analysis of the enormous body of the users and thus provides implications for industrial strategies such as targeted marketing. Here we propose a novel and statistically principled method, clust-LDA, which incorporates authorship structure into the topical modeling, thus accomplishing the task of the topical inferences across documents on the basis of authorship and, simultaneously, the identification of groupings between authors. We develop an inference procedure for clust-LDA and demonstrate its performance on simulated data, showing that clust-LDA out-performs the ‘vanilla’ LDA on the topic identification task where authors exhibit distinctive topical preference. We also showcase the empirical performance of clust-LDA based on a real-world social media dataset from Reddit. … 

**L1-Penalized Censored Gaussian Graphical Model** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Graphical lasso is one of the most used estimators for inferring genetic networks. Despite its diffusion, there are several fields in applied research where the limits of detection of modern measurement technologies make the use of this estimator theoretically unfounded, even when the assumption of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is satisfied. Typical examples are data generated by polymerase chain reactions and flow cytometer. The combination of censoring and high-dimensionality make inference of the underlying genetic networks from these data very challenging. In this paper we propose an $\ell_1$-penalized Gaussian graphical model for censored data and derive two EM-like algorithms for inference. By an extensive simulation study, we evaluate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and show that our proposal overcomes existing competitors when censored data are available. We apply the proposed method to gene expression data coming from microfluidic RT-qPCR technology in order to make inference on the regulatory mechanisms of blood development. …
