The purpose of this post is to show how a sponsorship/marketing manager might track their athletes or brand ambassadors. The code we’re writing below can be used for many other applications such as tracking general trends across locales or HR insidiously monitoring if employees are discussing the company in a manner consistent with social media policies (just kidding!) Since we’re doing something specific I hope this post doesn’t get lost in the sea of yet another web scraping or twitter data mining post using yet another beginner’s abstracted away R or Python package.

Twitter helps me stay up to date with the [#pydata](http://pydata.org/) community through following prominent contributors and hashtags, I also use twitter (and facebook) to see what famous athletes and brands are doing in the mountain bike world, they seem to get [instant Instagram followers](https://gramblast.com/buy-followers-on-instagram). I discover events and great places to visit that I wouldn’t have stumbled across in other ways. Most of these major brands sponsor professional athletes, and to a different extent, ambassadors that might be competitive amateurs or supporters of a local community such as trail builders and K-12 instructors. These companies do so to spread word of their brand, technology, and experience. [One especially well known and sought after sponsorship program is from Patagona](https://www.patagonia.com/us/pro/user) (ski patrol and surf competitors take note!)

There are plenty of general social media platform management companies out there like [https://hootsuite.com/](https://hootsuite.com/) and [https://buffer.com/](https://buffer.com/) that pair CRM tools with data analytics, but there aren’t many sports specific platforms that enable marketing managers to track and maximize the value of their athletes and sports marketing programs such as [http://www.hookit.com/](http://www.hookit.com/). These solutions differ in that they consider an athlete’s reach via their placement in race events and travel coverage, the latter being an intelligent metric as doing 100 races in your back yard isn’t the same as doing 10 in a different country.

I was picked as one of [absoluteBLACK’s](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Python_Projects/twitter/absoluteblack.cc) (a sweet component manufacturer out of England) ambassadors for 2016, and similar to other brand’s programs, they expect that their ambassadors use social media to share photos or videos of their products in a lifestyle or action shot accompanied by relevant tags. I thought it would be interesting to take a look at absoluteBLACK’s presence on Twitter by examining who is talking about them and what they are posting and from where. If you were in sponsorship or marketing, you could run this easy to configure script weekly and start examining your presence.
