Today's coding sprint was a bit more crowded, with some
notable scipy hackers such as Ralph Gommers, [Stefan van der Walt](http://mentat.za.net/),
[David Cournapeau](http://cournape.wordpress.com/) or [Fernando Perez](http://blog.fperez.org/) from Ipython joining in. On
what got done: - We merged [Jake](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas)'s new BallTree code. This is a pure
Cython implementation of a nearest-neighbor search similar to the KDTree
class in scipy.spatial, but much faster. The code looks awesome and it's
a big speedup compared to the older code. - Vlad is ready to merge
his[dictionary learning code](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/221), something that should happen in the
upcoming days. - Initial support for Python 3. scikit-learn should now
at least build and import cleanly under Python 3. - some bugfixes in the
Pipeline object and in docstrings. So this was the end of the
scikit-learn sprint, but EuroScipy has just begun. See you tomorrow at
the conference (follow the signs)!
