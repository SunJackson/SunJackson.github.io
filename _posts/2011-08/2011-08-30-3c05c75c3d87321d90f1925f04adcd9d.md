[Good news, everyone!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_J._Farnsworth#Characterizations) It was announced at Social Dev Camp 2011 over the weekend that [inThirty](http://inthirty.com/.), Datascope's "neighborhood shopping" webapp, finished third out of 12 finalists, as determined by public voting. Thanks for your votes, and a hearty congratulations to the other 11 finalists!

As a result, inThirty automatically moves on to the Grand Challenge round of the competition- public voting starts the first week of December. Until then we'll be continuing to improve inThirty, adding new features and datasets. If you have suggestions for us, please leave them on our [UserVoice forum](http://inthirty.uservoice.com/forums/131137-general) (also accessible via the feedback button in the app), or on [our previous blog post](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/the-birth-of-neighborhood-shopping-inthirty) where you can read the story of how InThirty came to be. If you're curious about some of the tech at work behind the scenes, we encourage you to check out [our about page](http://chicago.inthirty.com/about).

As a side note, inThirty was also [written about by Nathan Yau on his blog, FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2011/08/30/getting-around-chicago-in-30-minutes-or-less) today. We're all big fans, thanks for the mention, Nathan!

UPDATE (9/14/2011): Dice News just posted a video interview with the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Transportation as well as the top 3 winners from the transportation round, including Datascope's very own Brian Lange! Check it out below:
