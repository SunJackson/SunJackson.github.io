So far in the child theme tutorials for the WordPress Twenty Eleven theme, weâ€™ve created a [custom CSS](http://randyzwitch.com/2011/07/twenty-eleven-child-theme-creating-css-file) file and [custom header](http://randyzwitch.com/2011/07/custom-header-twenty-eleven-child-theme). Now, letâ€™s add a custom footer and remove â€œPowered by WordPressâ€�.

The first step to having a custom footer for your Twenty Eleven child theme is to copy the `footer.php` file from the parent Twenty Eleven theme into your directory. You will find this file on your server here:


 /wp-content/themes/twentyeleven


Once you have copied this file over to your Twenty Eleven child theme folder (for me the location on my server is `/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven-child`), you are done! You have a custom footer fileâ€¦but on your blog, everything will look the same. Thatâ€™s because while you technically have created a new footer for your blog, no code has actually changed. Weâ€™ll fix that in the next section.

I canâ€™t fault WordPress for wanting to drive traffic to their website, especially given they provide the Twenty Eleven theme for free. But that doesnâ€™t mean that â€œPowered by WordPressâ€� in the footer doesnâ€™t look goofy. Luckily, itâ€™s not too difficult to change.

Open up the ~~*header.php*~~ `footer.php` file from your child theme using your favorite text editor. In this file, youâ€™ll find the following code:

```
|1
2
|<?php do_action( 'twentyeleven_credits' ); ?>
<a href="<?php echo esc_url( __( 'http://wordpress.org/', 'twentyeleven' ) ); ?>" title="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Semantic Personal Publishing Platform', 'twentyeleven' ); ?>" rel="generator"><?php printf( __( 'Proudly powered by %s', 'twentyeleven' ), 'WordPress' ); ?></a>

```

All we need to do to remove â€œPowered by WordPressâ€� is to comment out this code using HTML comment tag, like the following:

```
|1
2
|<!-- <?php do_action( 'twentyeleven_credits' ); ?>
<a href="http://randyzwitch.com/removing-powered-by-wordpress-twenty-eleven/<?php echo esc_url( __( 'http://wordpress.org/', 'twentyeleven' ) ); ?>" title="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Semantic Personal Publishing Platform', 'twentyeleven' ); ?>" rel="generator"><?php printf( __( 'Proudly powered by %s', 'twentyeleven' ), 'WordPress' ); ?></a> -->

```

Once you hit save, youâ€™re all set. No more â€œPowered by WordPressâ€�, no more text at all. Just a blank footer.

Of course, just because you donâ€™t want â€œPowered by WordPressâ€� in the footer doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t want any links in the footer. If you want to add your own text/links, re-open your *footer.php* file and place your text in the same location as the code we just commented out.

For example, if I wanted to put â€œÂ© Randy Zwitch - 2011â€� in the footer, I would place this text between the opening and closing div tags for â€œsite generatorâ€�:

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
|
<!-- <?php do_action( 'twentyeleven_credits' ); ?>
<a href="http://randyzwitch.com/removing-powered-by-wordpress-twenty-eleven/<?php echo esc_url( __( 'http://wordpress.org/', 'twentyeleven' ) ); ?>" title="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Semantic Personal Publishing Platform', 'twentyeleven' ); ?>" rel="generator"><?php printf( __( 'Proudly powered by %s', 'twentyeleven' ), 'WordPress' ); ?></a> -->

Itâ€™s as easy as that to have a custom footer message! You can get even more tricky by widgets and ads and tag cloudsâ€¦but thereâ€™s something to be said for a clean, sleek design. So Iâ€™ll stop there ğŸ™‚
