Hi, my name’s Brian Lange, and I'm a co-op student working at
Datascope. This is the story of InThirty, my summer project and our
submission for the Apps For Metro Chicago contest.



Early this summer, we brainstormed possible projects to kick off my
co-op at Datascope. We quickly zeroed in on doing something with
the CTA's treasure
trove of open data and began filling the whiteboard with ideas.
We talked about using
the [Train](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker.aspx)
and Bus
Tracker data to find out which stations caused the most
slowdowns, and even considered hooking up sensors to our windows
(which are right by the Red, Brown and Purple Line tracks) to gather
our own data.



An idea that came out of those early talks that we really latched on
to was the idea of “neighborhood shopping”. When you
have to move to a city, how do you decide where to live? Could
picking a neighborhood to live in be as easy as picking out a TV on
Newegg? We started to study some fantastic sites that partially
address this question
like [NabeWise](http://nabewise.com/)
and [WalkScore](http://www.walkscore.com/), and thought
these sites could be improved upon by (i) allowing a user to choose
their interests, and (ii) bringing more data into the equation.



I started off on the "neighborhood shopping" project by learning
some [Python](http://python.org/.)
(using Mark Pilgrim's Dive Into
Python — a great resource if you're looking for one) and
writing some short scripts to experiment with various modules and
web APIs
(like [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/developers)). These were
early prototypes, but some of these scripts are still being used in
our current implementation.

After getting my feet wet, I turned towards the network science that
is at the core of much of what Datascope does. The CTA transit
system is a classic example of a directed network (so classic, in
fact, that it was my professors' example in my Data Structures
course at Northwestern. Shout out
to Professor
Horswill!). The train and bus stops act as the nodes of the
network, and the edges connecting the nodes each have a travel time
that acts as the weight. This network formulation makes it easy to
apply some pretty cool algorithms to find the shortest path between
any two stops, much like Google Maps.



It was around this time that we stumbled upon
the Apps for Metro
Chicago contest and decided we could enter our
“neighborhood shopping” app. We started looking through
the [city data portal](http://data.cityofchicago.org/)
and decided parks would be something people would probably like to
live near, and the city's park database gave us everything we
needed. So after learning some
basic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web
framework skills, I made our first iteration web app: ParkScore.
Users could put in an address and choose a method of transportation,
and ParkScore could tell them how many acres of parks were nearby
and show you where they were. Relatively simple, but once again, an
important part of our implementation today.

This “score” concept was great if you knew an address,
but what if you didn't? Well, if you can find a score for one
point, you can find it for many. We calculated “park scores” for
over 30,000 points across the city, and then found the average score
for each
Chicago
neighborhood by averaging the scores of each point inside that
neighborhood's borders.



Once we had this data, we needed a way to display it. Inspired by
some other map-based web apps
like [Mapnificent](http://www.mapnificent.net/)
and [Trulia](http://www.trulia.com/), we decided on a
minimal, map-only interface with a color coded heatmap overlay to
show the neighborhood's average “scores” at a glance.
At this point we had our current app and submission for
the Apps for Metro
Chicago contest: [InThirty](http://inthirty.com/.).



It's been a journey and a great learning experience already, and
there are lots of features and data sets yet to be added that will
bring InThirty closer and closer to our initial vision of a
"neighborhood shopping" app. Check it out, leave feedback or requests
in the comments below, and stay tuned — we'll know by Friday
whether InThirty is a Transportation Round finalist in the Apps for
Metro Chicago contest.
