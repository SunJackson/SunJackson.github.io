In mobile and web analytics churn describes the users who stop using a product. In a paid subscription service
it's just the number of users cancelling the subscription. For free products churn is often approximated by the
number of users who don't come back for a certain amount of time.

Especially when you grow fast, it is important to understand your churn. Because churn lags behind growth, but
will really kick in after a phase of strong growth. It is the reason why a constant inflow of new users
will not make a user base grow beyond a certain size.

For example assume that 30% of your users churn each month and you have 1 million new users per month. Then you
will never reach 3.5 million users.

Churn is a combination of different types of users stopping to use a product after different usages. Cara might
have been addicted to Candy Crush for a long time and could only abandoned it for
her love of connecting dots. Carl on the other hand really likes candy and would never crush it. That's why he
only shortly checked out the app in disgust.

It makes intuitive sense that long term users will be more loyal than a user who just installed your app because
he liked the emojis in your new Facebook ad. But how much more loyal are your long term users? That depends
on your product. Your historic usage data will tell you. Follow the cohort of users that started using your
product in a given month and observe how many of them are still around in the following months. This leads to a
curves like this:

The different cohorts in this chart all show similar behaviour. The curves are all pretty close. And most
of the difference is a result of the difference in the first month. The slopes of the curves in the later
months are very similar. The slope represents the fraction of users churning in a given month. The main
takeaway from this is:

> 
The monthly churn of a cohort in a given month is similar to the monthly churn of the previous monthly cohort
in the previous month.


Technically these curves do not only represent churn. If users get more likely to skip a month over time, this can
lead to a downwards slope without churn. But in most cases this is rare enough for us regard these as churn curves.
Of course the above only hold true, if there are no big changes to the product. If a new version introduces a bug,
the churn curves can get much steeper from one month to the other.

If you know of a factor that has a significant impact on the likelihood of users to churn, it might make sense to
split by this factor. At Clue for example we see different churn curves depending on the home country of a user. To
predict our churn, we look at the monthly churn curves per country and this gives us a very good prediction of our
actual churn.

Let's look at the simplest case in detail. We only use monthly churn curves and don't split by any other variable. Let's
count the time in month since the product launch. Let $m$ denote the month a cohort signed up in and $C_m(t)$ be
the number of users left at time $t$. We can now predict the churn we will see in August ($t=t_a$) already at the
end of June ($t=t_j$). We split all the active users in June $A_{t_j}$ into cohorts $C_m(t_j)$ by
the month they signed up in.

\[ A_{t_j} = \sum_{m=0}^{t_j} C_m(t_j) \]

The churn factor $f_{m}(t)$ we will see for these cohorts can be approximated by the previous cohorts churn
in the previous month.

\[ f_{m}(t) \approx f_{m-1}(t-1) = 1 - \frac{C_{m-1}(t_j)}{C_{m-1}(t_j-1)} \]

The churn $c(t_a)$ in August can then be calculated by the sum of the churn of the cohorts.

\[
c(t_a) \approx \sum_{m=0}^{t_j} C_m(t_j) \cdot f_{m}(t)
= \sum_{m=0}^{t_j} C_m(t_j) \cdot \big ( 1 - \frac{C_{m-1}(t_j)}{C_{m-1}(t_j-1)} \big )
\]

You can use this method to predict further ahead. But this leads to more uncertainty for two reasons. It will get
more likely to see a substantial change in the shapes of the churn curves. And secondly you also have to factor in
new users for the next month, which are not known yet.
