[Thoughts on reviewing](http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2016/04/thoughts-on-reviewing.html)



During ICML reviews I noticed that my personal take on reviewing is becoming increasingly distinct from my peers. Personally, I want to go to a conference and come away with renewed creativity and productivity. Thus, I like works that are thought provoking, groundbreaking, or particularly innovative; even if the execution is a bit off. However, I suspect most reviewers feel that accepting a paper is a validation of the quality and potential impact of the work. There's no right answer here, as far as I can tell. Certainly great work should be accepted and presented, but the problem is, there really isn't that much of it per unit time. Therefore, like a producer on a Brittany Spears album, we are faced with the problem of filling in the rest of the material. The validation mindset leads to the bulk of accepted papers being extremely well executed marginal improvements. It would be nice if the mix were tilted more towards the riskier novel papers.
