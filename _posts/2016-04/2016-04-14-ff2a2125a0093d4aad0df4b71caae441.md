Iâ€˜m happy to announce that **my analysis about Golden State Warriors passing network** is featured as the first 3rd party notebook to **Databricks Community Edition** in the **latest databricks blog post**.

Databricks Community Edition is

> 
a free version of the Databricks service that allows everyone to learn and explore Spark by providing a simple, integrated development environment for data scientists and engineers with high quality training materials and sample applications.


The notebook is based on **my previous post** and this time utilizes some great functionalities of Databricks Community Edition including:

- Free 6GB clusters on AWS

- Interactive workspace

- GraphFrames library

- Data registration as a SQL table

- D3 visualization

- Multiple language support


in a single notebook!

I personally found Databricks Community Edition is a graet platform to test your ideas easily without cluster management hassle and cloud cost.

If you want to try this out, you can join the waiting list from here.
