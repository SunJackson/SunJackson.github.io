For being in RSiteCatalyst retirement, Iâ€™m ending up working on more functionality lately Â¯_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯. Here are the changes for RSiteCatalyst 1.4.8, which should be available on CRAN shortly:

## Segment Stacking

RSiteCatalyst now has the ability to take multiple values in the `segment.id` keyword for the `Queue*` functions. This functionality was graciously provided by Adam Gitzes, closing an issue that was nearly a year old. At times it felt like I was hazing him with change requests, but for Adamâ€™s first open-source contribution, this is a huge addition in functionality.

So now you are able to pass multiple segments into a function call and get an â€˜ANDâ€™ behavior like so:

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
|stacked_seg <- QueueRanked("zwitchdev",
 "2016-03-08",
 "2016-03-09",
 "pageviews",
 "page",
 segment.id = c("5433e4e6e4b02df70be4ac63", "54adfe3de4b02df70be5ea08")
 )

```

The result (Visits from Social AND Visits from Apple Browsers):

## QueueSummary: Now with `date.to` and `date.from` keywords

In response to GitHub issue #158, `date.to` and `date.from` parameters were added; this was a minor, but long-term oversight (itâ€™s always been possible to do this in the Adobe Analytics API). So now rather than just specifying the `date` keyword and getting a full-year summary or a full-month, you can specify any arbitrary start/end dates.

## Trivial Fixes: Silenced `httr` message, clarified documentation

Starting with the newest version of httr, you get a message for any API call where the encoding wasnâ€™t set. So for long running `Queue*` requests, you may have received dozens of warnings to stdout about `"No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8."` This has been remedied, and the warning should no longer occur.

Also, the documentation for the `Queue*` functions was clarified to show an example of using SAINT classifications as the report breakdown; hopefully this didnâ€™t cause too much confusion to anyone else.

## Volunteers Wanted!

As I referenced in the first paragraph, while Iâ€™m fully committed to maintaining RSiteCatalyst, I donâ€™t currently have the time/desire to continue to develop the package to improve functionality. Given that I donâ€™t use this package for my daily work, itâ€™s hard for me to dedicate time to the project.

Thanks again to Adam Gitzes who stepped up and provided significant effort to close an outstanding feature request. I would love if others in the digital analytics community would follow Adamâ€™s lead; donâ€™t worry about whether you are â€˜good enoughâ€™, get a working solution together and weâ€™ll figure out how to harden the code and get it merged. Be the code change you want to see the world ðŸ™‚
