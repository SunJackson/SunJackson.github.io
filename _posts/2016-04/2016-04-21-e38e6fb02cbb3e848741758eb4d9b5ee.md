** Thu 21 April 2016

 

**Summary**: I raise some follow-up points to yesterday's post on
community-governed packaging efforts.

## The problem with conda-forge today

As discussed in [my blog post yesterday](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/conda-forge-centos-moment), [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/.) may offer the way
forward to create a community-governed package repository that meets the
standards already established in the Linux, R, and other open source
communities.

The single biggest problem with conda-forge right now is that its hosting of
build artifacts depends on closed source software and a proprietary hosting
service, [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/.) (formerly [binstar.org](http://binstar.org/)). To continue the Linux
analogy, it would be as if software for creating `apt` or `yum` package repos
were closed source. It's much better than not having any hosting service
available, but it would be better to have a option available that is open
source and under community governance. You can see how this works in the
[Debian / Ubuntu ecosystem](http://kaivanov.blogspot.com/2012/08/creating-apt-repository-with-reprepro.html), for example.

The same type of software used to create [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/.) and the on-premises
product analogue (which Continuum sells to enterprises to run on their own
servers -- so their own closed-source software can be conda-installed
behind firewalls) is also needed to create a network of publicly available
package mirrors. See R's [CRAN mirror network](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) for an example of what this
might look like.

## Summary

Solving the community-governed binary packaging problem completely requires the
non-trivial task of creating an open source conda build artifact server in
addition to the problem of operating shared build and test infrastructure.
