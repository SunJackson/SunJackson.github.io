As a prerequisite of my GSOC project I have to do some modifications on
sympy's current logic module (see previous post), so I decided to go out
and take a look at what others are doing in this area. [aima-python](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/logic.html) is
a project that tries to implement all algorithms found in the excellent
book AI: A Modern Approach (AIMA for short). Code is concise and well
written, but is has some (solvable) incompatibilities with SymPy's
design. In this module, all logic expressions (no matter if it's and,
or, xor etc) are implemented as an Expr class, but in SymPy we prefer to
have a base class and implement logic expressions (And, Or, etc.) as
subclasses, as this has proven to be a good modularization technique
sympy's core objects (Add, Mul, etc.). The book is also my primary
source of information, as I only learned very rudimentary logic at
college. [Pylog](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyLog) is a very interesting project implementing a logic
module (although it's primary goal is to write a Prolog interpreter in
Python). It's [logic module](http://christophe.delord.free.fr/pylog/src/pylog.py) seems to be written in a fashion very
similar to SymPy's standards, with a term class and variables predicates
deriving from this. Makes extensive use of python generators, something
that is lacking in my Python knowledge (and shouldn't!)
