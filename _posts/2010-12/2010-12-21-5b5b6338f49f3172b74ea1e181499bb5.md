In a [previous posting](/blog/november52010/index.html) we looked at the demographic breakdown of all registered facebook accounts in the **US**. Now I'd like to present some analysis of a subject close to my heart: *Casual Games*.

Below is a chart of the demographic profiles of *Bejeweled Blitz™* players on facebook (in the US). The vertical axis shows age, with *13 years of age* at the top, and *65 and above* at the bottom. There is a separate row for each distinct age between these two limits. Female fans are shown on the right with **pink** bars, and male fans to the left with **blue** bars.

In the interests of space, subsequent versions of this graph will be shown in thumbnail format, as shown below. The representation is the same – we’ve just removed the axis labels and compressed the space between the lines.

Because of the different denominators and sizes of each keyword population, each graph has been normalized so that the ‘area’ under each curve is the same. In this way, the shapes can be compared to contrast the demographic audience of each keyword.The demographics for *Bejeweled Blitz* players mirrors the demographics typically seen in the industry for casual download games players, which are typically biased towards the middle-aged female segment. For Bejeweled players on facebook, over 78% are female, with an impressive bulge in the curve between the ages of 25 and 50.|

Contrast this with players of *Call of Duty™*, which is adored by teenage boys!

Many of the social games we all know, such as *Farmville*, *Yoville* and *Treasure Isle* follow traditional **casual gaming** profiles. It’s refreshing for our industry to know that, as players migrate away from deluxe download games onto playing on social networks, it’s the same demographic audience.

As expected, some games do skew more male biased. *Texas Hold’em Poker* for instance. It’s not a great shock to find that this application is 67% male biased. Maybe a little more surprising, though not a hugely astonishing is *Castle Age*, which is 64% male.

Whilst *Restaurant City* skews female with 69%, its audience appears to peak at a younger age. *Country Story* skews even more female and similarly young, and *Happy Pets* even more again. This has implications for monetization as, on average, typically a smaller percentage of younger users make payments using microtransactions. Whilst there is a considerable variance, depending on the game, research indicates that the age band that converts the highest percentage of users to paying customers is the 25-35 year old bracket.

### It's not just games

We don’t have to limit ourselves to just games and applications; people become fans of other things on facebook. For instance, below are charts showing the demographic curves for fans of *Star Wars™* and *Twilight™*. The curve for *Twilight* should be no surprise to anyone who shares a house with a teenage daughter. The curve for *Star Wars* is interesting because of the ‘double hump’. There are distinct peaks for fans of the original trilogy (people now in their late 30’s and 40’s), as well as for the younger crowd groomed on prequel episodes and the Clone Wars.

Below are charts for the fans of the *Oprah Winfrey Show*, and the fans of *Ellen Degenerous*. At first glance they appear similar at 88-89% female fan base, but if you look closer you can see that Oprah’s audience is more mature, peaking in the late 30’s, while Ellen seems to appeal to women in their 20’s.

### Quiz time

I'll finish this post with a quiz. The graphs below show the demographic curves for three different entities: *Barry Manilow*, *Sex and the City* and *Howard Stern*. Can you work out which is which? Drop me an [email](mailto:ContactUs@DataGenetics.com) if you are having trouble.
