** Wed 20 July 2011

 

[SciPy 2011](http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011) was a blast! Intense and fun but of course tiring due to burning the candle at both ends. I was delighted to see a lot of familiar faces after my first SciPy conference last year: the Enthought crew ([Travis Oliphant](http://twitter.com/#!/teoliphant), Eric Jones, et al), [Peter Wang](http://twitter.com/#!/pwang) ([chaco](http://code.enthought.com/chaco)), [Fernando Pérez](http://fperez.org/) and [MinRK / Min Ragan-Kelley](http://twitter.com/#!/minrk) (of [IPython](http://ipython.org/) fame), my statsmodels collaborator [Skipper Seabold](http://twitter.com/#!/jseabold), [Stefan van der Walt](http://mentat.za.net/), Josh Hemann, and too many others to mention. It was also great to finally meet a lot of other well-known SciPythonistas for the first time: [Chris Fonnesbeck](http://twitter.com/#!/fonnesbeck) ([PyMC](http://code.google.com/p/pymc)), [John D. Cook](http://twitter.com/#!/JohnDCook), [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/) ([scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable), [Mayavi](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi)), and many others. A 2-day slate of talks seems too little to do justice to all the awesome stuff people are doing!

Here's partial list of my favorite parts of the conference and general thoughts (in no particular order). Since there were two talk tracks running in parallel I unfortunately could only see half the talks; fortunately videos should be soon posted. I'll return to this post and add video links once they're available. I'll write a separate post about our statsmodels sprint!

#### **Fernando Pérez's [IPython](http://ipython.org/.) talk: [Slides](http://fperez.org/talks/1107_ipython_scipy.pdf)**

I always tell people that IPython is one of scientific Python's killer apps. For proof, watch the video of Fernando's talk once it's up. Chris Fonnesbeck wrote a great [blog article](http://stronginference.com/weblog/2011/7/15/innovations-in-ipython.html) on the new features in IPython. In essence they've taken an already innovative and hugely productivity enhancing tool and rearchitected it to be a) much more easily embedded (see the rich Qt console and the web interface) and b) an extremely powerful parallel computing environment. Truly inspiring work from MinRK, Fernando, Brian Granger, and crew. My hat's off to you guys.

On my end I started using the rich Qt console (ipython-qtconsole) for interactive work and demos a few months ago. Having inline matplotlib plots while doing tech demos is a huge, huge win!

#### **Peter Wang's talk on [Metagraph](http://metagraph.org/): [Slides](http://metagraph.org/metagraph_scipy2011.pdf)**

Fortunately Peter's slides have notes on them which helps to understand the slides in more detail. He's working to solve some really major problems here at the core of how we do computation on arrays. The notes do far better justice to the talk, but the nutshell is that he's building a loop-fusing (a.k.a. "stream fusion") compiler for expressing array computations and processing streaming data. This is extremely exciting as for the longest time this has been a watershed between NumPy-based tools and work being done in the APL/J/K family and functional languages like Haskell. Especially for big data / streaming data applications, a "fusing" compiler / VM will eliminate loops and enable the program to make only single passes over the data as opposed to multiple passes as commonly happens now. This is related to Python projects like [numexpr](http://code.google.com/p/numexpr) and [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano) (which are also worth checking out).

The extent of what's possible with these kinds of ideas is a bit hard to grok but I'm very much looking forward to seeing how this project develops over the coming 6 months. As he says **"The goal is to make scientiﬁc computing Pythonic"**. Bringing the full power of array-based and functional languages at the core computational level with a very Pythonic interface could have very serious impact on the direction of scientific computing.

#### **Gaël Varoquaux's Neuroscience / scikit-learn Talk: [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/GaelVaroquaux/python-for-brain-mining-neuroscience-with-state-of-the-art-machine-learning-and-data-visualization)**

If you've ever tried making a presentation in LaTeX, it should be clear that Gaël is at one with the beamer gods. That is one swanky looking deck of slides; it should come as no shock that it's had nearly 30k views on SlideShare! Aesthetics aside, I'm excited to see how much progress the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable) folks have made on building a really excellent machine learning library. Now if only we can get that much muscle poured into [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)! I think generally machine learning is an optimal application area for the scientific Python stack and this talk shows why: solid algos, great data visualization, and excellent task / workflow / big data management tools (e.g. joblib).

As an aside, Gaël's point that you "**cannot develop science and software separately**" is highly relevant to all data-driven fields of academic research. Far too often in academia, software development is viewed as a distant second to innovations in methodology. Faculty very rarely get tenure based on their contributions to research software, no matter how impactful. As a result, graduate students and faculty alike are left re-inventing the wheel more often that not, leading to a wasteland of essentially throwaway MATLAB or R code. I am hopeful that this pattern will someday change at a grand scale.
