A blog post about
productivity? No
one’s [ever](http://www.43folders.com/) [done](http://zenhabits.net/) [one](http://www.lifehack.org/topics/productivity) of
those [before!](http://gigaom.com/collaboration)



But seriously, here at Datascope we think we have a pretty good system.
And it doesn't involve expensive TeamServerDeluxeCloudTaskMachine
fanciness, just our favorite office media: marker on whiteboards or
post-its.



It's relatively simple to understand — each post-it represents
one task. When you make a new task, you stick it under a project
header on the board. Underneath those headers, if there are
multiple people working on a project, you can make people subheaders
and go to the board together to see what needs to get done and
delegate it under the people subheaders. Finally, when you do a
task, you can take it off the board and add it to the "done
section" with a satisfying smack.

Here are some reasons we're growing to love this system:



The fact that you have to fit tasks on single post-its ensure that
tasks are well defined and not too big.


Our system doesn't follow the productivity nerd mantra that
is [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done),
but it does incorporate an important aspect of that system —
ubiquitous capture. With post-its at everyone's desk,
it's easy to jot a task down so you can get it out of your
head and keep working.


It's easy to add tasks that need to be done in sequence; just
stick post-its on top of each other. You can't see the next
task to be done until after you finish the current one.


Keeping tasks on the boards ensures they don't "follow you
home". Thinking about work after hours isn't a bad
thing, but worrying about everything you have to do tomorrow is.


Post-its make tasks visible. Everyone in the office can get a
general idea of how active each project is and easily see if
someone might need help, just by glancing at the board. Think of
it as a task histogram, of sorts.


While the system makes tasks visible at a glance, the notes are
too small to be read from your desk, so you don't get
distracted with other people's tasks.


Building on the visibility point, it's very visible when you
get something done; it's satisfying to remove a physical
object from the board and add it to an ever-growing pile of
finished tasks, and everyone sees you do it. You may even earn
some nerd-cred for finishing particularly daunting tasks.


Post-its make tasks transparent. Everyone can see what everyone
is doing, and it makes it easy for workers to get involved with
each projects. Rather than a traditional task list which
encourages individual productivity, the post-it note method
emphasizes team productivity — everyone's working to get the
board clear (which never happens).

Even though our system doesn't use any sophisticated technologies,
we certainly aren't luddites (although it would be satisfying to
take a sledge hammer
to [some](http://www.atlassian.com/) [task](http://trac.edgewall.org/) [management](http://www.zoho.com/projects) [systems](http://www.mylifeorganized.net/)).
We're always looking for ways to improve our system, whether there's
tech involved or not. Recently, we've talked about how time lapse
cameras focused on the boards could help show what's getting done,
and what tasks people are avoiding.



What do you think? Is there a way to manage team tasks that you
like? Are you thinking of converting to the Sacred Brotherhood of
Post-its On Whiteboards? Drop us a line in the comments.



And with that, if you'll excuse me, I have a Post-it to go put on
the done board.
