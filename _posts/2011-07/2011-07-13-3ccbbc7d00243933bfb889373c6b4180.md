I really like [The Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/.) (although I don’t like celebrating number-days, eventually we’d all have to buy Hallmark cards). It was inspired by [http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/pi.html](http://inverseprobability.com/2011/07/13/Pi%20is%20Wrong). It made me want to have a Tau Clock. So I bought a 24 hour clock from [Seldeck](http://www.seldecpublishing.co.uk/clocks) (thanks to [Jaakko Peltonen](http://users.ics.tkk.fi/jtpelto) for finding the 24 hour clock after I mentioned the idea) and wrote a short [MATweave](http://inverseprobability.com/2011/07/13/matweave.html) document to create a face for it. Now I have a Tau Clock.

(for counter arguments to Tau see [The Pi Manifesto](http://www.thepimanifesto.com/), although personally I feel if that’s all they’ve got then Pi really is dead …)

The clock is going to be given to my colleague as a present from our group for his birthday.

**Update:** I found another Tau Clock [here](http://www.sbcrafts.net/clocks). Although I find it rather offensive. They have the hour hand going around the clock twice to perform one turn, which is almost as silly as having a constant that needs to be doubled to represent a full turn. I think they are cashing in. That said, I do like the idea of the hand going backwards in line with polar coordinates. Jaakko and I discussed this but concluded that we were unlikely to find a 24 hour clock mechanism that ran backwards. This may also be another one [here](http://www.giftsforageek.com/marketplace/439134037/Dozenal_tau_clock).
