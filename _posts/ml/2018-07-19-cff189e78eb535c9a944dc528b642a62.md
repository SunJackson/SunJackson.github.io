I used to be a big fan of Numpy’s
[savez](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html)
and
[load](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.load.html),
since you can throw any Python structure in there that you want to save.
However, these files are not compatible between Python 2 and 3, so they do not
fit my needs anymore since I have computers running both versions. I took the
matter to
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18071075/saving-dictionaries-to-file-numpy-and-python-2-3-friendly),
but a clear winner did not emerge.

Finally, I decided to write my own alternative to `savez` based on HDF5 using
[PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/). The result can be found in our
[deepdish](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/deepdish) project (in
[hdf5io.py](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/deepdish/blob/master/deepdish/io/hdf5io.py)).
It also seconds as a general-purpose HDF5 saver/loader. First, an example of
how to write a [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/.)-compatible data file:

```
import deepdish as dd
import numpy as np

X = np.zeros((100, 3, 32, 32))
y = np.zeros(100)

dd.io.save('test.h5', {'data': X, 'label': y}, compression=None)

```

Note that Caffe does not like the compressed version, so we are turning off
compression. Let’s take a look at it:

```
$ h5ls test.h5
data Dataset {100, 3, 32, 32}
label Dataset {100}

```

It will load into a dictionary with `dd.io.load`:

Now, it does much more than that. It can save numbers, lists, strings,
dictionaries and numpy arrays. It will try its best to store things natively in
HDF5, so that it could be read by other programs as well. Another example:

```
>>> x = [np.arange(3), {'d': 100, 'e': 'hello'}]
>>> dd.io.save('test.h5', x)
>>> dd.io.load('test.h5')
[array([0, 1, 2]), {'e': 'hello', 'd': 100}]

```

If it doesn’t know how to save a particular data type, it will fall-back and
use pickling. This means it will still work, but you will lose the
compatibility across Python 2 and 3.
