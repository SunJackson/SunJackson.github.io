Last week the R Core Team [released](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2018/000630.html) the latest update to the R statistical data analysis environment, R version 3.5.1. This update (codenamed "[Feather Spray](https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1972/03/09)" — a [*Peanuts* reference](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/09/28/r-release-names)) makes no user-visible changes and fixes a few bugs. It is backwards-compatible with R 3.5.0, and users can find updates for Windows, Linux and Mac systems at their [local CRAN mirror](https://cloud.r-project.org/). (The update to [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) featuring the R 3.5.1 engine is scheduled for release on August 29.)

The complete list of fixes to R 3.5.1 is included in the release announcement, found at the link below.
