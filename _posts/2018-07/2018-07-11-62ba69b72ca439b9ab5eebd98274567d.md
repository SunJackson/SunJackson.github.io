[`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) and [`rqdatatable`](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable) are new [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/.) packages for data wrangling; either at scale (in databases, or big data systems such as Apache Spark), or in-memory. The packages speed up both execution (through optimizations) and development (though a good mental model and up-front error checking) for data wrangling tasks.

[Win-Vector LLC](http://www.win-vector.com/site)‘s [John Mount](http://www.win-vector.com/site/staff/john-mount) will be speaking on the [`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) and [`rqdatatable`](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable) packages at the [The East Bay R Language Beginners Group Tuesday, August 7, 2018 (Oakland, CA)](https://www.meetup.com/r-enthusiasts/events/251390661).



One may ask: “why share new packages with an “R Language Beginners Group?” (Though, I prefer to use the term [“part time R user”](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/tag/part-time-r-user).) Because: such packages can give such users easy, safe, consistent, and performant access to powerful data systems. `rquery` establishes a notation and links to external data providers such as PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, and Apache Spark. `rqdatatable` supplies an additional in-memory implementation of the `rquery` notation using the powerful [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) package.

`rquery` and `rqdatatable` can, *if* given a fair chance, be significant `R` tools. Users **are** that chance.

If you are around please come see the talk.

Some earlier articles on `rquery` and `rqdatatable` can be found [here](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/01/rquery-fast-data-manipulation-in-r) and [here](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/07/speed-up-your-r-work).
