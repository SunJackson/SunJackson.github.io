`rquery` and `rqdatatable` are new `R` packages for data wrangling; either at scale (in databases, or big data systems such as Apache Spark), or in-memory. The packages speed up both execution (through optimizations) and development (though a good mental model and up-front error checking) for data wrangling tasks.

Win-Vector LLC‘s John Mount will be speaking on the `rquery` and `rqdatatable` packages at the The East Bay R Language Beginners Group Tuesday, August 7, 2018 (Oakland, CA).



One may ask: “why share new packages with an “R Language Beginners Group?” (Though, I prefer to use the term “part time R user”.) Because: such packages can give such users easy, safe, consistent, and performant access to powerful data systems. `rquery` establishes a notation and links to external data providers such as PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, and Apache Spark. `rqdatatable` supplies an additional in-memory implementation of the `rquery` notation using the powerful `data.table` package.

`rquery` and `rqdatatable` can, *if* given a fair chance, be significant `R` tools. Users **are** that chance.

If you are around please come see the talk.
