[**DetMCD Algorithm**](http://phdtree.org/pdf/37977954-a-deterministic-algorithm-for-robust-location-and-scatter) [![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
](https://www.google.de/search?q=DetMCD Algorithm)Most algorithms for highly robust estimators of multivariate location and scatter start by drawing a large number of random subsets. For instance, the FASTMCD algorithm of Rousseeuw and Van Driessen starts in this way, and then takes so-called concentration steps to obtain a more accurate approximation to the MCD. The FASTMCD algorithm is affine equivariant but not permutation invariant. In this article,we present a deterministic algorithm, denoted as DetMCD, which does not use random subsets and is even faster. It computes a small number of deterministic initial estimators, followed by concentration steps. DetMCD is permutation invariant and very close to affine equivariant. … 

[**WaveNet**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08370v1) [![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
](https://www.google.de/search?q=WaveNet)Various sources have reported the WaveNet deep learning architecture being able to generate high-quality speech, but to our knowledge there haven’t been studies on the interpretation or visualization of trained WaveNets. This study investigates the possibility that WaveNet understands speech by unsupervisedly learning an acoustically meaningful latent representation of the speech signals in its receptive field; we also attempt to interpret the mechanism by which the feature extraction is performed. Suggested by singular value decomposition and linear regression analysis on the activations and known acoustic features (e.g. F0), the key findings are (1) activations in the higher layers are highly correlated with spectral features; (2) WaveNet explicitly performs pitch extraction despite being trained to directly predict the next audio sample and (3) for the said feature analysis to take place, the latent signal representation is converted back and forth between baseband and wideband components. … 

[**PoseNet**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09662v1) [![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
](https://www.google.de/search?q=PoseNet)The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has demonstrated the unique advantage in audio, image and text learning; recently it has also challenged Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory cells (LSTM) in sequence-to-sequence learning, since the computations involved in CNN are easily parallelizable whereas those involved in RNN are mostly sequential, leading to a performance bottleneck. However, unlike RNN, the native CNN lacks the history sensitivity required for sequence transformation; therefore enhancing the sequential order awareness, or position-sensitivity, becomes the key to make CNN the general deep learning model. In this work we introduce an extended CNN model with strengthen position-sensitivity, called PoseNet. A notable feature of PoseNet is the asymmetric treatment of position information in the encoder and the decoder. Experiments shows that PoseNet allows us to improve the accuracy of CNN based sequence-to-sequence learning significantly, achieving around 33-36 BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, and around 44-46 BLEU scores on the English-to-French translation task. …
