**When: **
July 24, 2018 11 am PT, 2 pm ET, 6 pm GMT


Who builds products for the product people? As a product manager, you know how helpful custom tailored data solutions can be to doing your job well. But proper data analytics solutions take work to deliver - it's not as simple as just building a dashboard.


Learn product analytics best practices from Andrew Wynn, Product Manager at Looker. He will give the "meta" perspective from a practitioner who is building products that anybody, including product managers, can use to access, analyze, and act on data to make important decisions. 


In this webinar, we'll cover:

- Real examples for different verticals
- How to adapt solutions for different company sizes
- How Looker incorporates analytics in their product development process.
- And more
