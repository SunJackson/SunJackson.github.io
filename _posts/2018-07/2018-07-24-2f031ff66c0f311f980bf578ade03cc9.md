If you're after a quick overview of some of the services available in Azure to build AI-enabled applications, you might want to check out the 6-minute video below. It provides a tour of three services:

- Azure Cognitive Services, pre-trained machine learning models to detect and characterize faces, text sentiment, and more 

- Azure Machine Learning, a development, deployment and management framework for machine learning models you train yourself, and

- Azure Bot Service, a framework for creating intelligent chat-based interfaces.
