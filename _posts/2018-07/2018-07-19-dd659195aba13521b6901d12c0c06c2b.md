Dear Igor,could you please announce this on nuit blanche.many thanks,Johan

PhD and Postdoc positions KU Leuven: Optimization frameworks for deep kernel machinesThe research group KU Leuven ESAT-STADIUS is currently offering 2 PhD and 1 Postdoc (1 year, extendable) positions within the framework of the KU Leuven C1 project Optimization frameworks for deep kernel machines (promotors: Prof. Johan Suykens and Prof. Panos Patrinos).Deep learning and kernel-based learning are among the very powerful methods in machine learning and data-driven modelling. From an optimization and model representation point of view, training of deep feedforward neural networks occurs in a primal form, while kernel-based learning is often characterized by dual representations, in connection to possibly infinite dimensional problems in the primal. In this project we aim at investigating new optimization frameworks for deep kernel machines, with feature maps and kernels taken at multiple levels, and with possibly different objectives for the levels. The research hypothesis is that such an extended framework, including both deep feedforward networks and deep kernel machines, can lead to new important insights and improved results. In order to achieve this, we will study optimization modelling aspects (e.g. variational principles, distributed learning formulations, consensus algorithms), accelerated learningschemes and adversarial learning methods.The PhD and Postdoc positions in this KU Leuven C1 project (promotors: Prof. Johan Suykens and Prof. Panos Patrinos) relate to the following  possible topics:-1- Optimization modelling for deep kernel machines-2- Efficient learning schemes for deep kernel machines-3- Adversarial learning for deep kernel machinesFor further information and on-line applying, see[https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/54740654](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/54740654)" (PhD positions) and[https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/54740649](https://www.kuleuven.be/personeel/jobsite/jobs/54740649)" (Postdoc position)(click EN for English version).The research group ESAT-STADIUS [http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius](http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius) at the university KU Leuven Belgium provides an excellent research environment being active in the broad area of mathematical engineering, including data-driven modelling, neural networks and machine learning, nonlinear systems and complex networks, optimization, systems and control, signal processing, bioinformatics and biomedicine.
