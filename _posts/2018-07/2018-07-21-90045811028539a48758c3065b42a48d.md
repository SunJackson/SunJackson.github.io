[R.devices](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R.devices) 2.16.0 – *Unified Handling of Graphics Devices* – is on CRAN. With this release, you can now easily **suppress unwanted graphics**, e.g. graphics produced by one of those do-everything-in-one-call functions that we all bump into once in a while. To suppress graphics, the **R.devices** package provides graphics device `nulldev()`, and function `suppressGraphics()`, which both send any produced graphics into the void. This works on all operating systems, including Windows.

## Examples

```
library(R.devices)
nulldev()
plot(1:100, main = "Some Ignored Graphics")
dev.off()

```

```
R.devices::suppressGraphics({
 plot(1:100, main = "Some Ignored Graphics")
})

```

## Other Features

Some other reasons for using the **R.devices** package:


**No need to call dev.off()** – Did you ever forgot to call `dev.off()`, or did a function call produce an error causing `dev.off()` not to be reached, leaving a graphics device open? By using one of the `toPDF()`, `toPNG()`, … functions, or the more general `devEval()` function, `dev.off()` is automatically taken care of.


**No need to specify filename extension** – Did you ever switch from using `png()` to, say, `pdf()`, and forgot to update the filename resulting in a `my_plot.png` file that is actually a PDF file? By using one of the `toPDF()`, `toPNG()`, … functions, or the more general `devEval()` function, filename extensions are automatically taken care of – just specify the part without the extension.


**Specify the aspect ratio** – rather than having to manually calculate device-specific arguments `width` or `height`, e.g. `toPNG("my_plot", { plot(1:10) }, aspectRatio = 2/3)`. This is particularly useful when switching between device types, or when outputting to multiple ones at the same time.


**Unified API for graphics options** – conveniently set (most) graphics options including those that can otherwise only be controlled via arguments, e.g. `devOptions("png", width = 1024)`.


**Control where figure files are saved** – the default is folder `figures/` but can be set per device type or globally, e.g. `devOptions("*", path = "figures/col/")`.


**Easily produce EPS and favicons** – `toEPS()` and `toFavicon()` are friendly wrappers for producing EPS and favicon graphics.


**Capture and replay graphics** – for instance, use `future::plan(remote, workers = "remote.server.org"); p %<-% capturePlot({ plot(1:10) })` to produce graphics on a remote machine, and then display it locally by printing `p`.


### Some more examples

```
R.devices::toPDF("my_plot", {
 plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
})
### [1] "figures/my_plot.pdf"

```

```
R.devices::toPNG("my_plot", {
 plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
})
### [1] "figures/my_plot.png"

```

```
R.devices::toEPS("my_plot", {
 plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
})
### [1] "figures/my_plot.eps"

```

```
R.devices::devEval(c("png", "pdf", "eps"), name = "my_plot", {
 plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
}, aspectRatio = 1.3)
### $png
### [1] "figures/my_plot.png"
### 
### $pdf
### [1] "figures/my_plot.pdf"
### 
### $eps
