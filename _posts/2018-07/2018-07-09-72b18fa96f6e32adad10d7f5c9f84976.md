 Many real-world problems require integrating multiple sources of information.
 Sometimes these problems involve multiple, distinct modalities of
 information — vision, language, audio, etc. — as is required
 to understand a scene in a movie or answer a question about an image.
 Other times, these problems involve multiple sources of the same
 kind of input, i.e. when summarizing several documents or drawing one
 image in the style of another.
 


 When approaching such problems, it often makes sense to process one source
 of information *in the context of* another; for instance, in the
 right example above, one can extract meaning from the image in the context
 of the question. In machine learning, we often refer to this context-based
 processing as *conditioning*: the computation carried out by a model
 is conditioned or *modulated* by information extracted from an
 auxiliary input.
 


 Finding an effective way to condition on or fuse sources of information
 is an open research problem, and
 
 in this article, we concentrate on a specific family of approaches we call
 *feature-wise transformations*.
 
 We will examine the use of feature-wise transformations in many neural network
 architectures to solve a surprisingly large and diverse set of problems;
 
 their success, we will argue, is due to being flexible enough to learn an
 effective representation of the conditioning input in varied settings.
 In the language of multi-task learning, where the conditioning signal is
 taken to be a task description, feature-wise transformations
 learn a task representation which allows them to capture and leverage the
 relationship between multiple sources of information, even in remarkably
 different problem settings.

## Feature-wise transformations


 To motivate feature-wise transformations, we start with a basic example,
 where the two inputs are images and category labels, respectively. For the
 purpose of this example, we are interested in building a generative model of
 images of various classes (puppy, boat, airplane, etc.). The model takes as
 input a class and a source of random noise (e.g., a vector sampled from a
 normal distribution) and outputs an image sample for the requested class.
 


 Our first instinct might be to build a separate model for each
 class. For a small number of classes this approach is not too bad a solution,
 but for thousands of classes, we quickly run into scaling issues, as the number
 of parameters to store and train grows with the number of classes.
 We are also missing out on the opportunity to leverage commonalities between
 classes; for instance, different types of dogs (puppy, terrier, dalmatian,
 etc.) share visual traits and are likely to share computation when
 mapping from the abstract noise vector to the output image.
 


 Now let’s imagine that, in addition to the various classes, we also need to
 model attributes like size or color. In this case, we can’t
 reasonably expect to train a separate network for *each* possible
 conditioning combination! Let’s examine a few simple options.
 


 A quick fix would be to concatenate a representation of the conditioning
 information to the noise vector and treat the result as the model’s input.
 This solution is quite parameter-efficient, as we only need to increase
 the size of the first layer’s weight matrix. However, this approach makes the implicit
 assumption that the input is where the model needs to use the conditioning information.
 Maybe this assumption is correct, or maybe it’s not; perhaps the
 model does not need to incorporate the conditioning information until late
 into the generation process (e.g., right before generating the final pixel
 output when conditioning on texture). In this case, we would be forcing the model to
 carry this information around unaltered for many layers.
 


 Because this operation is cheap, we might as well avoid making any such
 assumptions and concatenate the conditioning representation to the input of
 *all* layers in the network. Let’s call this approach
 *concatenation-based conditioning*.
 


 Another efficient way to integrate conditioning information into the network
 is via *conditional biasing*, namely, by adding a *bias* to
 the hidden layers based on the conditioning representation.
 


 Interestingly, conditional biasing can be thought of as another way to
 implement concatenation-based conditioning. Consider a fully-connected
 linear layer applied to the concatenation of an input
 x\mathbf{x}x and a conditioning representation
 z\mathbf{z}z:
 
 The same argument applies to convolutional networks, provided we ignore
 the border effects due to zero-padding.
 



 Yet another efficient way to integrate class information into the network is
 via *conditional scaling*, i.e., scaling hidden layers
 based on the conditioning representation.
 


 A special instance of conditional scaling is feature-wise sigmoidal gating:
 we scale each feature by a value between 000 and
 111 (enforced by applying the logistic function), as a
 function of the conditioning representation. Intuitively, this gating allows
 the conditioning information to select which features are passed forward
 and which are zeroed out.
 


 Given that both additive and multiplicative interactions seem natural and
 intuitive, which approach should we pick? One argument in favor of
 *multiplicative* interactions is that they are useful in learning
 relationships between inputs, as these interactions naturally identify
 “matches”: multiplying elements that agree in sign yields larger values than
 multiplying elements that disagree. This property is why dot products are
 often used to determine how similar two vectors are.
 
 Multiplicative interactions alone have had a history of success in various
 domains — see Bibliographic Notes.
 
 One argument in favor of *additive* interactions is that they are
 more natural for applications that are less strongly dependent on the
 joint values of two inputs, like feature aggregation or feature detection
 (i.e., checking if a feature is present in either of two inputs).
 


 In the spirit of making as few assumptions about the problem as possible,
 we may as well combine *both* into a
 conditional *affine transformation*.
 
 An affine transformation is a transformation of the form
 y=m∗x+by = m * x + by=m∗x+b.
 



 All methods outlined above share the common trait that they act at the
 *feature* level; in other words, they leverage *feature-wise*
 interactions between the conditioning representation and the conditioned
 network. It is certainly possible to use more complex interactions,
 but feature-wise interactions often strike a happy compromise between
 effectiveness and efficiency: the number of scaling and/or shifting
 coefficients to predict scales linearly with the number of features in the
 network. Also, in practice, feature-wise transformations (often compounded
 across multiple layers) frequently have enough capacity to model complex
 phenomenon in various settings.
 


 Lastly, these transformations only enforce a limited inductive bias and
 remain domain-agnostic. This quality can be a downside, as some problems may
 be easier to solve with a stronger inductive bias. However, it is this
 characteristic which also enables these transformations to be so widely
 effective across problem domains, as we will later review.
 

### Nomenclature


 To continue the discussion on feature-wise transformations we need to
 abstract away the distinction between multiplicative and additive
 interactions. Without losing generality, let’s focus on feature-wise affine
 transformations, and let’s adopt the nomenclature of Perez et al.
 , which formalizes conditional affine
 transformations under the acronym *FiLM*, for Feature-wise Linear
 Modulation.
 
 Strictly speaking, *linear* is a misnomer, as we allow biasing, but
 we hope the more rigorous-minded reader will forgive us for the sake of a
 better-sounding acronym.
 



 We say that a neural network is modulated using FiLM, or *FiLM-ed*,
 after inserting *FiLM layers* into its architecture. These layers are
 parametrized by some form of conditioning information, and the mapping from
 conditioning information to FiLM parameters (i.e., the shifting and scaling
 coefficients) is called the *FiLM generator*.
 In other words, the FiLM generator predicts the parameters of the FiLM
 layers based on some auxiliary input.
 Note that the FiLM parameters are parameters in one network but predictions
 from another network, so they aren’t learnable parameters with fixed
 weights as in the fully traditional sense.
 For simplicity, you can assume that the FiLM generator outputs the
 concatenation of all FiLM parameters for the network architecture.
 


 As the name implies, a FiLM layer applies a feature-wise affine
 transformation to its input. By *feature-wise*, we mean that scaling
 and shifting are applied element-wise, or in the case of convolutional
 networks, feature map -wise.
 
 To expand a little more on the convolutional case, feature maps can be
 thought of as the same feature detector being evaluated at different
 spatial locations, in which case it makes sense to apply the same affine
 transformation to all spatial locations.
 
 In other words, assuming x\mathbf{x}x is a FiLM layer’s
 input, z\mathbf{z}z is a conditioning input, and
 γ\gammaγ and β\betaβ are
 z\mathbf{z}z-dependent scaling and shifting vectors,

 FiLM(x)=γ(z)⊙x+β(z).
 \textrm{FiLM}(\mathbf{x}) = \gamma(\mathbf{z}) \odot \mathbf{x}
 + \beta(\mathbf{z}).
 FiLM(x)=γ(z)⊙x+β(z).

 You can interact with the following fully-connected and convolutional FiLM
 layers to get an intuition of the sort of modulation they allow:
 


 In addition to being a good abstraction of conditional feature-wise
 transformations, the FiLM nomenclature lends itself well to the notion of a
 *task representation*. From the perspective of multi-task learning,
 we can view the conditioning signal as the task description. More
 specifically, we can view the concatenation of all FiLM scaling and shifting
 coefﬁcients as both an instruction on *how to modulate* the
 conditioned network and a *representation* of the task at hand. We
 will explore and illustrate this idea later on.

## Feature-wise transformations in the literature


 Feature-wise transformations find their way into methods applied to many
 problem settings, but because of their simplicity, their effectiveness is
 seldom highlighted in lieu of other novel research contributions. Below are
 a few notable examples of feature-wise transformations in the literature,
 grouped by application domain. The diversity of these applications
 underscores the flexible, general-purpose ability of feature-wise
 interactions to learn effective task representations.
 


expand all



 Perez et al. use
 FiLM layers to build a visual reasoning model
 trained on the CLEVR dataset to
 answer multi-step, compositional questions about synthetic images.
 



 The model’s linguistic pipeline is a FiLM generator which
 extracts a question representation that is linearly mapped to
 FiLM parameter values. Using these values, FiLM layers inserted within each
 residual block condition the visual pipeline. The model is trained
 end-to-end on image-question-answer triples. Strub et al.
 later on improved on the model by
 using an attention mechanism to alternate between attending to the language
 input and generating FiLM parameters layer by layer. This approach was
 better able to scale to settings with longer input sequences such as
 dialogue and was evaluated on the GuessWhat?! 
 and ReferIt datasets.
 



 de Vries et al. leverage FiLM
 to condition a pre-trained network. Their model’s linguistic pipeline
 modulates the visual pipeline via conditional batch normalization,
 which can be viewed as a special case of FiLM. The model learns to answer natural language questions about
 real-world images on the GuessWhat?! 
 and VQAv1 datasets.
 



 The visual pipeline consists of a pre-trained residual network that is
 fixed throughout training. The linguistic pipeline manipulates the visual
 pipeline by perturbing the residual network’s batch normalization
 parameters, which re-scale and re-shift feature maps after activations
 have been normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. As hinted
 earlier, conditional batch normalization can be viewed as an instance of
 FiLM where the post-normalization feature-wise affine transformation is
 replaced with a FiLM layer.
 



 Dumoulin et al. use
 feature-wise affine transformations — in the form of conditional
 instance normalization layers — to condition a style transfer
 network on a chosen style image. Like conditional batch normalization
 discussed in the previous subsection,
 conditional instance normalization can be seen as an instance of FiLM
 where a FiLM layer replaces the post-normalization feature-wise affine
 transformation. For style transfer, the network models each style as a separate set of
 instance normalization parameters, and it applies normalization with these
 style-specific parameters.
 



 Dumoulin et al. use a simple
 embedding lookup to produce instance normalization parameters, while
 Ghiasi et al. further
 introduce a *style prediction network*, trained jointly with the
 style transfer network to predict the conditioning parameters directly from
 a given style image. In this article we opt to use the FiLM nomenclature
 because it is decoupled from normalization operations, but the FiLM
 layers used by Perez et al. were
 themselves heavily inspired by the conditional normalization layers used
 by Dumoulin et al. .
 



 Yang et al. use a related
 architecture for video object segmentation — the task of segmenting a
 particular object throughout a video given that object’s segmentation in the
 first frame. Their model conditions an image segmentation network over a
 video frame on the provided first frame segmentation using feature-wise
 scaling factors, as well as on the previous frame using position-wise
 biases.
 



 So far, the models we covered have two sub-networks: a primary
 network in which feature-wise transformations are applied and a secondary
 network which outputs parameters for these transformations. However, this
 distinction between *FiLM-ed network* and *FiLM generator*
 is not strictly necessary. As an example, Huang and Belongie
 propose an alternative
 style transfer network that uses adaptive instance normalization layers,
 which compute normalization parameters using a simple heuristic.
 



 Adaptive instance normalization can be interpreted as inserting a FiLM
 layer midway through the model. However, rather than relying
 on a secondary network to predict the FiLM parameters from the style
 image, the main network itself is used to extract the style features
 used to compute FiLM parameters. Therefore, the model can be seen as
 *both* the FiLM-ed network and the FiLM generator.
 



 As discussed in previous subsections, there is nothing preventing us from considering a
 neural network’s activations *themselves* as conditioning
 information. This idea gives rise to
 *self-conditioned* models.
 



 Highway Networks are a prime
 example of applying this self-conditioning principle. They take inspiration
 from the LSTMs’ heavy use of
 feature-wise sigmoidal gating in their input, forget, and output gates to
 regulate information flow:
 



 The ImageNet 2017 winning model also
 employs feature-wise sigmoidal gating in a self-conditioning manner, as a
 way to “recalibrate” a layer’s activations conditioned on themselves.
 



 For statistical language modeling (i.e., predicting the next word
 in a sentence), the LSTM 
 constitutes a popular class of recurrent network architectures. The LSTM
 relies heavily on feature-wise sigmoidal gating to control the
 information flow in and out of the memory or context cell
 c\mathbf{c}c, based on the hidden states
 h\mathbf{h}h and inputs x\mathbf{x}x at
 every timestep t\mathbf{t}t.
 



 Also in the domain of language modeling, Dauphin et al. use sigmoidal
 gating in their proposed *gated linear unit*, which uses half of the
 input features to apply feature-wise sigmoidal gating to the other half.
 Gehring et al. adopt this
 architectural feature, introducing a fast, parallelizable model for machine
 translation in the form of a fully convolutional network.
 



 The Gated-Attention Reader 
 uses feature-wise scaling, extracting information
 from text by conditioning a document-reading network on a query. Its
 architecture consists of multiple Gated-Attention modules, which involve
 element-wise multiplications between document representation tokens and
 token-specific query representations extracted via soft attention on the
 query representation tokens.
 



 The Gated-Attention architecture 
 uses feature-wise sigmoidal gating to fuse linguistic and visual
 information in an agent trained to follow simple “go-to” language
 instructions in the VizDoom 3D
 environment.
 



 Bahdanau et al. use FiLM
 layers to condition Neural Module Network
 and LSTM -based policies to follow
 basic, compositional language instructions (arranging objects and going
 to particular locations) in a 2D grid world. They train this policy
 in an adversarial manner using rewards from another FiLM-based network,
 trained to discriminate between ground-truth examples of achieved
 instruction states and failed policy trajectories states.
 



 Outside instruction-following, Kirkpatrick et al.
 also use
 game-specific scaling and biasing to condition a shared policy network
 trained to play 10 different Atari games.
 



 The conditional variant of DCGAN ,
 a well-recognized network architecture for generative adversarial networks
 , uses concatenation-based
 conditioning. The class label is broadcasted as a feature map and then
 concatenated to the input of convolutional and transposed convolutional
 layers in the discriminator and generator networks.
 



 For convolutional layers, concatenation-based conditioning requires the
 network to learn redundant convolutional parameters to interpret each
 constant, conditioning feature map; as a result, directly applying a
 conditional bias is more parameter efficient, but the two approaches are
 still mathematically equivalent.
 



 PixelCNN 
 and WaveNet  — two recent
 advances in autoregressive, generative modeling of images and audio,
 respectively — use conditional biasing. The simplest form of
 conditioning in PixelCNN adds feature-wise biases to all convolutional layer
 outputs. In FiLM parlance, this operation is equivalent to inserting FiLM
 layers after each convolutional layer and setting the scaling coefficients
 to a constant value of 1.
 
 The authors also describe a location-dependent biasing scheme which
 cannot be expressed in terms of FiLM layers due to the absence of the
 feature-wise property.
 




 WaveNet describes two ways in which conditional biasing allows external
 information to modulate the audio or speech generation process based on
 conditioning input:
 



**Global conditioning** applies the same conditional bias
 to the whole generated sequence and is used e.g. to condition on speaker
 identity.
 

**Local conditioning** applies a conditional bias which
 varies across time steps of the generated sequence and is used e.g. to
 let linguistic features in a text-to-speech model influence which sounds
 are produced.
 


 As in PixelCNN, conditioning in WaveNet can be viewed as inserting FiLM
 layers after each convolutional layer. The main difference lies in how
 the FiLM-generating network is defined: global conditioning
 expresses the FiLM-generating network as an embedding lookup which is
 broadcasted to the whole time series, whereas local conditioning expresses
 it as a mapping from an input sequence of conditioning information to an
 output sequence of FiLM parameters.
 



 Kim et al. modulate a deep
 bidirectional LSTM using a form
 of conditional normalization. As discussed in the
 *Visual question-answering* and *Style transfer* subsections,
 conditional normalization can be seen as an instance of FiLM where
 the post-normalization feature-wise affine transformation is replaced
 with a FiLM layer.
 



 The key difference here is that the conditioning signal does not come from
 an external source but rather from utterance
 summarization feature vectors extracted in each layer to adapt the model.
 



 For domain adaptation, Li et al. 
 find it effective to update the per-channel batch normalization
 statistics (mean and variance) of a network trained on one domain with that
 network’s statistics in a new, target domain. As discussed in the
 *Style transfer* subsection, this operation is akin to using the network as
 both the FiLM generator and the FiLM-ed network. Notably, this approach,
 along with Adaptive Instance Normalization, has the particular advantage of
 not requiring any extra trainable parameters.
 



 For few-shot learning, Oreshkin et al.
 explore the use of FiLM layers to
 provide more robustness to variations in the input distribution across
 few-shot learning episodes. The training set for a given episode is used to
 produce FiLM parameters which modulate the feature extractor used in a
 Prototypical Networks 
 meta-training procedure.

## Related ideas


 Aside from methods which make direct use of feature-wise transformations,
 the FiLM framework connects more broadly with the following methods and
 concepts.
 


expand all



 The idea of learning a task representation shares a strong connection with
 zero-shot learning approaches. In zero-shot learning, semantic task
 embeddings may be learned from external information and then leveraged to
 make predictions about classes without training examples. For instance, to
 generalize to unseen object categories for image classification, one may
 construct semantic task embeddings from text-only descriptions and exploit
 objects’ text-based relationships to make predictions for unseen image
 categories. Frome et al. , Socher et
 al. , and Norouzi et al.
 are a few notable exemplars
 of this idea.
 



 The notion of a secondary network predicting the parameters of a primary
 network is also well exemplified by HyperNetworks , which predict weights for entire layers
 (e.g., a recurrent neural network layer). From this perspective, the FiLM
 generator is a specialized HyperNetwork that predicts the FiLM parameters of
 the FiLM-ed network. The main distinction between the two resides in the
 number and specificity of predicted parameters: FiLM requires predicting far
 fewer parameters than Hypernetworks, but also has less modulation potential.
 The ideal trade-off between a conditioning mechanism’s capacity,
 regularization, and computational complexity is still an ongoing area of
 investigation, and many proposed approaches lie on the spectrum between FiLM
 and HyperNetworks (see Bibliographic Notes).
 



 Some parallels can be drawn between attention and FiLM, but the two operate
 in different ways which are important to disambiguate.
 



 This difference stems from distinct intuitions underlying attention and
 FiLM: the former assumes that specific spatial locations or time steps
 contain the most useful information, whereas the latter assumes that
 specific features or feature maps contain the most useful information.
 



 With a little bit of stretching, FiLM can be seen as a special case of a
 bilinear transformation
 with low-rank weight
 matrices. A bilinear transformation defines the relationship between two
 inputs x\mathbf{x}x and z\mathbf{z}z and the
 kthk^{th}kth output feature yky_kyk​ as

 yk=xTWkz.
 y_k = \mathbf{x}^T W_k \mathbf{z}.
 yk​=xTWk​z.

 Note that for each output feature yky_kyk​ we have a separate
 matrix WkW_kWk​, so the full set of weights forms a
 multi-dimensional array.
 



 If we view z\mathbf{z}z as the concatenation of the scaling
 and shifting vectors γ\gammaγ and β\betaβ and
 if we augment the input x\mathbf{x}x with a 1-valued feature,
 
 As is commonly done to turn a linear transformation into an affine
 transformation.
 
 we can represent FiLM using a bilinear transformation by zeroing out the
 appropriate weight matrix entries:
 



 For some applications of bilinear transformations,
 see the Bibliographic Notes.

## Properties of the learned task representation


 As hinted earlier, in adopting the FiLM perspective we implicitly introduce
 a notion of *task representation*: each task — be it a question
 about an image or a painting style to imitate — elicits a different
 set of FiLM parameters via the FiLM generator which can be understood as its
 representation in terms of how to modulate the FiLM-ed network. To help
 better understand the properties of this representation, let’s focus on two
 FiLM-ed models used in fairly different problem settings:
 


 The visual reasoning model of Perez et al.
 , which uses FiLM
 to modulate a visual processing pipeline based off an input question.
 
 The linguistic pipeline acts as the FiLM generator. FiLM layers in each residual block modulate the visualpipeline. feature extractorsub-networkFiLM layerReLU Each residual block has a FiLM layer added to it. sub-networkFiLM layer…linearFiLM parametersAreGRUthereGRUmoreGRUcubesGRUthanGRUyellowGRUthingsGRU



 The artistic style transfer model of Ghiasi et al.
 , which uses FiLM to modulate a
 feed-forward style transfer network based off an input style image.
 
 The FiLM generator predicts parameters describing the target style. The style transfer network is conditioned by making the instance normalization parameters style-dependent. FiLM generatorFiLM parameterssub-networknormalizationFiLM layersub-networknormalizationFiLM layer… conditional instance normalization conditional instance normalization 




 As a starting point, can we discern any pattern in the FiLM parameters as a
 function of the task description? One way to visualize the FiLM parameter
 space is to plot γ\gammaγ against β\betaβ,
 with each point corresponding to a specific task description and a specific
 feature map. If we color-code each point according to the feature map it
 belongs to we observe the following:
 


 The plots above allow us to make several interesting observations. First,
 FiLM parameters cluster by feature map in parameter space, and the cluster
 locations are not uniform across feature maps. The orientation of these
 clusters is also not uniform across feature maps: the main axis of variation
 can be γ\gammaγ-aligned, β\betaβ-aligned, or
 diagonal at varying angles. These findings suggest that the affine
 transformation in FiLM layers is not modulated in a single, consistent way,
 i.e., using γ\gammaγ only, β\betaβ only, or
 γ\gammaγ and β\betaβ together in some specific
 way. Maybe this is due to the affine transformation being overspecified, or
 maybe this shows that FiLM layers can be used to perform modulation
 operations in several distinct ways.
 


 Nevertheless, the fact that these parameter clusters are often somewhat
 “dense” may help explain why the style transfer model of Ghiasi et al.
 is able to perform style
 interpolations: any convex combination of FiLM parameters is likely to
 correspond to a meaningful parametrization of the FiLM-ed network.
 


 To some extent, the notion of interpolating between tasks using FiLM
 parameters can be applied even in the visual question-answering setting.
 Using the model trained in Perez et al. ,
 we interpolated between the model’s FiLM parameters for two pairs of CLEVR
 questions. Here we visualize the input locations responsible for
 the globally max-pooled features fed to the visual pipeline’s output classifier:
 


 The network seems to be softly switching where in the image it is looking,
 based on the task description. It is quite interesting that these semantically
 meaningful interpolation behaviors emerge, as the network has not been
 trained to act this way.
 


 Despite these similarities across problem settings, we also observe
 qualitative differences in the way in which FiLM parameters cluster as a
 function of the task description. Unlike the style transfer model, the
 visual reasoning model sometimes exhibits several FiLM parameter
 sub-clusters for a given feature map.
 


 At the very least, this may indicate that FiLM learns to operate in ways
 that are problem-specific, and that we should not expect to find a unified
 and problem-independent explanation for FiLM’s success in modulating FiLM-ed
 networks. Perhaps the compositional or discrete nature of visual reasoning
 requires the model to implement several well-defined modes of operation
 which are less necessary for style transfer.
 


 Focusing on individual feature maps which exhibit sub-clusters, we can try
 to infer how questions regroup by color-coding the scatter plots by question
 type.
 


 Sometimes a clear pattern emerges, as in the right plot, where color-related
 questions concentrate in the top-right cluster — we observe that
 questions either are of type *Query color* or *Equal color*,
 or contain concepts related to color. Sometimes it is harder to draw a
 conclusion, as in the left plot, where question types are scattered across
 the three clusters.
 


 In cases where question types alone cannot explain the clustering of the
 FiLM parameters, we can turn to the conditioning content itself to gain
 an understanding of the mechanism at play. Let’s take a look at two more
 plots: one for feature map 26 as in the previous figure, and another
 for a different feature map, also exhibiting several subclusters. This time
 we regroup points by the words which appear in their associated question.
 


 In the left plot, the left subcluster corresponds to questions involving
 objects positioned *in front* of other objects, while the right
 subcluster corresponds to questions involving objects positioned
 *behind* other objects. In the right plot we see some evidence of
 separation based on object material: the left subcluster corresponds to
 questions involving *matte* and *rubber* objects, while the
 right subcluster contains questions about *shiny* or
 *metallic* objects.
 


 The presence of sub-clusters in the visual reasoning model also suggests
 that question interpolations may not always work reliably, but these
 sub-clusters don’t preclude one from performing arithmetic on the question
 representations, as Perez et al. 
 report.
 


 Perez et al. report that this sort of
 task analogy is not always successful in correcting the model’s answer, but
 it does point to an interesting fact about FiLM-ed networks: sometimes the
 model makes a mistake not because it is incapable of computing the correct
 output, but because it fails to produce the correct FiLM parameters for a
 given task description. The reverse can also be true: if the set of tasks
 the model was trained on is insufficiently rich, the computational
 primitives learned by the FiLM-ed network may be insufficient to ensure good
 generalization. For instance, a style transfer model may lack the ability to
 produce zebra-like patterns if there are no stripes in the styles it was
 trained on. This could explain why Ghiasi et al.
 report that their style transfer
 model’s ability to produce pastiches for new styles degrades if it has been
 trained on an insufficiently large number of styles. Note however that in
 that case the FiLM generator’s failure to generalize could also play a role,
 and further analysis would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion.
 


 This points to a separation between the various computational
 primitives learned by the FiLM-ed network and the “numerical recipes”
 learned by the FiLM generator: the model’s ability to generalize depends
 both on its ability to parse new forms of task descriptions and on it having
 learned the required computational primitives to solve those tasks. We note
 that this multi-faceted notion of generalization is inherited directly from
 the multi-task point of view adopted by the FiLM framework.
 


 Let’s now turn our attention back to the overal structural properties of FiLM
 parameters observed thus far. The existence of this structure has already
 been explored, albeit more indirectly, by Ghiasi et al.
 as well as Perez et al.
 , who applied t-SNE
 on the FiLM parameter values.
 


 The projection on the left is inspired by a similar projection done by Perez
 et al. for their visual reasoning
 model trained on CLEVR and shows how questions group by question type.
 The projection on the right is inspired by a similar projection done by
 Ghiasi et al. for their style
 transfer network. The projection does not cluster artists as neatly as the
 projection on the left, but this is to be expected, given that an artist’s
 style may vary widely over time. However, we can still detect interesting
 patterns in the projection: note for instance the isolated cluster (circled
 in the figure) in which paintings by Ivan Shishkin and Rembrandt are
 aggregated. While these two painters exhibit fairly different styles, the
 cluster is a grouping of their sketches.
 


 To summarize, the way neural networks learn to use FiLM layers seems to
 vary from problem to problem, input to input, and even from feature to
 feature; there does not seem to be a single mechanism by which the
 network uses FiLM to condition computation. This flexibility may
 explain why FiLM-related methods have been successful across such a
 wide variety of domains.

## Discussion


 Looking forward, there are still many unanswered questions.
 Do these experimental observations on FiLM-based architectures generalize to
 other related conditioning mechanisms, such as conditional biasing, sigmoidal
 gating, HyperNetworks, and bilinear transformations? When do feature-wise
 transformations outperform methods with stronger inductive biases and vice
 versa? Recent work combines feature-wise transformations with stronger
 inductive bias methods
 ,
 which could be an optimal middle ground. Also, to what extent are FiLM’s
 task representation properties
 inherent to FiLM, and to what extent do they emerge from other features
 of neural networks (i.e. non-linearities, FiLM generator
 depth, etc.)? If you are interested in exploring these or other
 questions about FiLM, we recommend looking into the code bases for
 FiLM models for visual reasoning
 and style transfer
 which we used as a
 starting point for our experiments here.
 


 Finally, the fact that changes on the feature level alone are able to
 compound into large and meaningful modulations of the FiLM-ed network is
 still very surprising to us, and hopefully future work will uncover deeper
 explanations. For now, though, it is a question that
 evokes the even grander mystery of how neural networks in general compound
 simple operations like matrix multiplications and element-wise
 non-linearities into semantically meaningful transformations.
