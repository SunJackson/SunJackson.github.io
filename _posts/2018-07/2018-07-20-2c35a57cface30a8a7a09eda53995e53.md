**Ready your Skills for a Cloud-First World with Google** 

Companies in every industry are looking for engineers with machine learning expertise. By 2020, Artificial Intelligence will create 2.3 million jobs -- and destroy 1.8 million others. Jobs of the future will require highly technical skills, and the ability to derive insights from data using machine learning.

[The Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization on Coursera](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=XUZwX0cABqY&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fmachine-learning-tensorflow-gcp) is a 100% online program that will help you jumpstart your career in this new field. It’s a 5-course Specialization, which includes hands-on labs, that will take you from a strategic overview of why machine learning matters to practical skills in building real-world, accurate ML models.

You can start your journey towards becoming a machine learning specialist today with a [**7-day free trial**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=XUZwX0cABqY&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fmachine-learning-tensorflow-gcp).

Get an inside look into the Specialization from Lak Lakshmanan, the Google Big Data & Machine Learning Tech Lead who helped develop it. Find out why machine learning on Google Cloud matters and what skills you’ll be able to add to your resume after completing the Specialization:

 

**What stands out about how Google approaches machine learning?**

Google has transformed itself into an AI-first company. Machine learning (which is an AI technique) is part of nearly all of our products, from Gmail to YouTube to Google Search. Many technical innovations in machine learning (like word2vec and batch normalization), practical machine learning architectures (like the Inception model and the Attention mechanism) and, of course, TensorFlow, were invented at Google. We are historically open with our innovation, believing that it benefits the research community and the world at large, when we publish papers and open source our software. Offering the machine learning specialization is part of our commitment to openness.

 

**Who is the ideal learner for this course?**

A developer who is looking to upskill, in order to become the machine learning engineer at their company or for their product. I’m thinking of the journey that many of Google’s engineers took to gain the knowledge and skills needed to infuse machine learning into our products.

**After completing this specialization, what will learners be able to add to their resume?**

Aside from building skills in TensorFlow and practical ML, learners will be able to add a project to their resume to show they can walk the walk. The specialization includes practical working ML models that serve batch or online predictions. Being able to put a link to a working ML model like ML Poetry or Babyweight beats buzzwords on a resume any time.

With the Google Cloud learning programs offered on [Coursera](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=XUZwX0cABqY&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fgoogle-cloud-training), you can gain in-demand Cloud, Data, and Machine Learning skills from Google experts.

This is your chance to learn how to build machine learning models that give any organization a competitive edge.
