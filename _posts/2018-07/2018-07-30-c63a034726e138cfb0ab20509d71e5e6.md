“The majority of organizations have barely moved beyond static BI reports and are unaware of the actual potential their data holds. Going from being ‘data unaware’ to investing in a big data architecture in one leap sets a company up for a bad ROI in analytics. A solid investment must begin with understanding what data is actually available and identifying the low hanging ‘data fruits’ that can lead to real value for the company. This can be used to build lightweight solutions that are imperfect but hugely beneficial. It can provide real-world tools for decision support via recommended actions or highlighted opportunities in real-time. It can offload much of the routine repetitive decision-making to algorithms so that professionals can operate with a more strategic view of the organization and bring their creative talents to their company’s challenges.” Sean McClure ( November 3, 2014 )
