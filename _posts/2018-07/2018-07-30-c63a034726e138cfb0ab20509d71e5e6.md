“Information overload occurs when the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity. Decision makers have fairly limited cognitive processing capacity. Consequently, when information overload occurs, it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur.” Speier, Cheri; Valacich, Joseph; Vessey, Iris ( 1999 )
