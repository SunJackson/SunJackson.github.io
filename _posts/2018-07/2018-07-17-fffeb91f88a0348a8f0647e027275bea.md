### [1 — A team of AI algorithms just crushed humans in a complex computer game](https://blog.openai.com/openai-five)

](https://blog.openai.com/openai-five)We start our June edition from breathtaking but discouraging news for the Dota 2 players! OpenAI Five has developed **a team of AI players that started to defeat amateur Dota 2 teams**. Using a neural network, each of them learned not only how to play the game, but also how to cooperate with its teammates. Previously the algorithms were capable of winning only individually. So, humans better pick up their swords to fight, because AI is coming for them.

### [2 — Through-Wall Human Pose Estimation Using Radio Signals](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Zhao_Through-Wall_Human_Pose_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*G5YnRzMCII69d4Am.jpg)
](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Zhao_Through-Wall_Human_Pose_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)With the new computer vision algorithm based on the fact that a wireless signal can pass through walls but is reflected off humans, it is thus possible to **spy on people behind a wall**. This article demonstrates that tracking the human motions by a radio-based system can be almost as accurate as the vision-based one used to train it. The major limitation for this technology is that the wireless signal data has a way lower spatial resolution compared to the vision one. But even regardless of this fact, we can not underestimate its multifaceted applicability!

### [3 — Neural Scene Representation and Rendering](https://deepmind.com/blog/neural-scene-representation-and-rendering)

As a general rule, the larger is the labeled dataset, the more accurate are the predictions of the trained neural net. However, being done manually, labeling is a very long and painful task. But do we really need this? If we look deeper into the problem, we will see that nature is not functioning that way. For instance, a baby starts to recognize an elephant by seeing it from different scenes before even realising what it is. This could be an inspiration. DeepMind presents a new **algorithm capable of reproducing the 3D environment by learning from its different 2D viewpoints**and visualizing its scene from another perspective that hasn’t been processed yet.

### [4— **Machine Learning Predicts World Cup Winner**](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611397/machine-learning-predicts-world-cup-winner)

](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611397/machine-learning-predicts-world-cup-winner)In this article the authors explain how machine learning taking into account features such as players’ average age, FIFA’s ranking, country’s GDP and population, etc. can help to **foresee the potential winner**.

In this article the authors explain how machine learning taking into account features such as players’ average age, FIFA’s ranking, country’s GDP and population, etc. can help to **foresee the potential winner**.

Eventually, even the most trusted algorithms can be mistaken. Germany was predicted to win the World Cup, however, unfortunately, they were eliminated in the group stage. This example proves that we can apply machine learning to everything.

Sincere congratulations to the French team who has recently won the World Cup!

The drone industry is developing at a rapid pace. Goldman Sachs estimated that drone technologies will reach a **total market size of $100 billion before 2020**! Check some interesting statistics [here](http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/technology-driving-innovation/drones). I quite believe that in the future we will get our parcels or beer from a supermarket delivered by drones… even if [Amazon has currently suspended their drones’ projects of goods transferring](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/10/apple-microsoft-uber-drones-approved-testing-amazon).

Prepare for a coding session!

### [9 — **H3: Uber’s Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index**](https://eng.uber.com/h3)

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*EtvXSfVlFs1tmJia)
](https://eng.uber.com/h3)Uber has developed H3 library, a powerful grid system for analyzing the spatial data. The main idea behind this is bucketing events into hexagonal areas and establishing the hierarchical indices by regrouping smaller hexagons in larger ones. Such a grid system allows Uber to optimize ride pricing and dispatch by comparing the offer and demand within the area. Good news is that **H3 has become open sourced** and everyone can now hexagonify the world to efficiently explore its spatial data!
