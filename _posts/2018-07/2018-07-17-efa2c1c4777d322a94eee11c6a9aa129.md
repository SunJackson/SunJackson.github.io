This blog is a continuation of [ Basic Image Data Analysis Using Numpy and OpenCV – Part 1](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/07/basic-image-data-analysis-numpy-opencv-p1.html).

### **Use logical Operator to Process Pixel Values**

We can create a bullion ndarray in the same size by using a **logical operator**. However, this won’t create any new array but it simply returns **True** to its host variable. For example: let’s consider we want to filter out some low value pixel or high value or (any condition) in an RGB image and yes it would be great to convert RGB to gray scale but for now we won’t go for that rather than deal with color image.

Let’s first load an image and show it on screen.

![OK, let’s consider this dump image. Now, for any case we want to filter out all the pixel value which is below than, let’s assume 20. For this we’ll use logical operator to do this task which we’ll return as a value of True for all the index.](http://feedproxy.google.com/images/demo-fig-1-418.jpg)


Now as we said, a host variable, well this name is not traditionally used but i refer it because it behaves. It just holds the True value and nothing else. So, if we see the shape of both low_pixel and pic , we’ll find that both have the same shape.****

We generated that low value filter using a global comparison operator for all the values less than 200. However, we can use this low_pixel array as an index to set those low values to some specific values which may be higher than or lower than the previous pixel value.

### **Masking**

Image masking is an image processing technique that is used to remove the background from which photographs those have fuzzy edges, transparent or hair portions.

Now, we’ll create a mask that is in shape of a circular disc. First we’ll measure distance from center of the image to every border pixel values. And we take a convenient radius value and then using logical operator we’ll create a circular disc. It’s quite simple, let’s see the code.

### **Satellite Image Processing**

One of MOOC course on edX, we’ve introduced with some satellite images and its processing system. It’s very informative of course. However, let’s do a few analysis task on it.

Let’s see some basic info of it.

Now, There’s something interesting about this image. Like many other visualizations, the colors in each rgb layer mean something. For example, the intensity of the red will be an indication of altitude of the geographical data point in the pixel. The intensity of blue will indicate a measure of aspect and the green will indicate slope. These colors will help to communicate this information in a quicker and more effective way rather than showing numbers.

- Red pixel indicates: **Altitude**

- Blue pixel indicates: **Aspect**

- Green pixel indicates: **Slope**


There is, by just looking at this colorful image, a trained eye can tell already what the altitude, what’s the slope, what’s the aspect. So that’s the idea of loading some more meaning to these colors to indicate something more scientific.

### **Detecting High Pixel of Each Channel**
