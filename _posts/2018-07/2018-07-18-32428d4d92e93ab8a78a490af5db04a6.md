Kevin Lewis sends along [this press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180717135725.htm) reporting what may be the least surprising laboratory finding since the [classic](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/07/08/29495) “Participants reported being hungrier when they walked into the café (mean = 7.38, SD = 2.20) than when they walked out [mean = 1.53, SD = 2.70, F(1, 75) = 107.68, P < 0.001]."
