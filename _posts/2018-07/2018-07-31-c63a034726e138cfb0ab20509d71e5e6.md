“I can see at least two options where methods from Data Science will benefit from Linked Data technologies and vice versa:– Machine learning algorithms benefit from the linking of various data sets by using ontologies and common vocabularies as well as reasoning, which leads to a broader data basis with (sometimes) higher data quality– Linked Data based knowledge graphs benefit from Graph Data Analyses to identify data gaps and potential links (find an example for a semantic knowledge graph about ‘Data Science’ here: http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/data-science)“ Andreas Blumauer ( October 28, 2014 )
