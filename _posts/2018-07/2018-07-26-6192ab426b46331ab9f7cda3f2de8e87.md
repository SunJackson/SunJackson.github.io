Whistler is at the end of  a long steep windy road (BC-99) along the beautiful Howe Sound.  The drive makes you wonder how drivers navigate it safely in the snow. We rode about 80% of the trails offered over our 3 day stay in Creekside
As a testament to the incredible trail networks in our backyard in Seattle and Bellingham, manage your expectations. You might find that the only unique trails at Whistler are the massive machine made, air-sailing trails like A-Line. You’ll have more endurance to do multiple runs and have more confidence sailing through the air on a true DH-bike. If you want to take a break away from the mountain or ride with the whole family there are a TONS of trails to ride in the valley. You can find road, gravel, and cross country trails.
