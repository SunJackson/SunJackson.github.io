Then I reread it and paid attention to the graphs and models (which don’t seem to be actual models, but rather, well, lines.) The story makes sense, but the science part is questionable (or at least unclear.)
Perhaps you’d like to have a look? This isn’t as important as paying attention to data fraud in cancer research, but January is really busy in recruitment and people are always worried about how to best approach their job hunt.

Some experiments are pretty much ads in disguise (the neologism used to describe this escapes me.) A prime example of this is what I call the “6 second rule” [not this one — ed.]:
Apparently, an eye-tracking experiment suggests that recruiters spend just a few seconds on a resume. Sure, they have to sieve through dozens if not hundreds of resumes, but an average of 6 seconds? Not sure.
