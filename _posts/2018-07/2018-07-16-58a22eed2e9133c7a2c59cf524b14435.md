**DataRobot**

**CEO:** Jeremy Achin

DataRobot uses artificial intelligence to help data scientists build and deploy predictive analytics models faster than previously possible. That alleviates challenges enterprises are facing from a scarcity of data professionals.

The Boston-based startup's machine-learning engine captures the knowledge, experience and best practices of data scientists. The platform trains and evaluates models by searching through millions of possible combinations of algorithms, pre-processing steps, features, transformations and tuning parameters to deliver those best suited for customer data sets and prediction targets.

Those predictive models can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises.
