The quality of mathematical modelling is looked at from the perspective of science’s own quality control arrangement and recent crises. It is argued that the crisis in the quality of modelling is at least as serious as that which has come to light in fields such as medicine, economics, psychology, and nutrition. In the context of the nascent sociology of quantification, the linkages between big data, algorithms, mathematical and statistical modelling (use and misuse of p-values) are evident. Looking at existing proposals for best practices the suggestion is put forward that the field needs a thorough Reformation, leading to a new grammar for modelling. Quantitative methodologies such as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can form the bedrock on which the new grammar is built, while incorporating important normative and ethical elements. To this effect we introduce sensitivity auditing, quantitative storytelling, and ethics of quantification.
