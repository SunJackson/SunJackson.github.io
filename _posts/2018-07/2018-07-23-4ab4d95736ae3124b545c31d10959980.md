Two years ago, we hosted our first Meetup in NYC. Our goal? Community. We’re still at it today, and our data community is growing stronger than ever. But as it grows, we want to know more about you - and we need your help to tell us!

When we first embarked on this journey, we sought to engage with the vast data ecosystem of the world and unite the individuals as passionate about data science as we are. Be they technical, non-technical, academics, students, professionals, enthusiasts, or other - we wanted to bring them together to share their experiences.
Thirty-four NYC Meetups, 8,000 members, nine US cities and six in Europe, tons of brilliant speakers, and a lot of pizza and beer later, we’re still working toward that goal. Building this network, we’ve met individuals from beginners eager to learn to leading industry doers and thought leaders at companies like Spotify
