Bill Venables, member of the R Foundation, co-author of the [Introduction to R manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf), [R package developer](https://www.rdocumentation.org/collaborators/name/Bill%20Venables?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=10907-287229), and one of the smartest *and* nicest (a rare combo!) people you will ever meet, received some gifts from the user!2018 conference committee in recognition of his longtime service to the R community. He received a book of reminiscences from those whose lives he has touched, and this blanket:


The design on the blanket is the â€œHex Sticker Wallâ€� that was on design during the conference, [created by Mitchell Oâ€™Hara-Wild](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/user-2018-feature-wall):


The design for the wall was created â€” naturally â€” using R. Mitchell created an [R script](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) that will arrange a folder of hexagon images according to a specified layout. He then used a map of Australia to lay out the hex sticker coordinates within the map boundaries and plotted that to create the Hexwall. If you have a similar collection of hex images you could use the same technique to arrange them into any shape you like. The details are provided in the blog post linked below.
