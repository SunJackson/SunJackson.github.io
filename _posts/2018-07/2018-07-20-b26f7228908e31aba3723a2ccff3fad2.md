Bill Venables, member of the R Foundation, co-author of the Introduction to R manual, R package developer, and one of the smartest *and* nicest (a rare combo!) people you will ever meet, received some gifts from the user!2018 conference committee in recognition of his longtime service to the R community. He received a book of reminiscences from those whose lives he has touched, and this blanket:

The design on the blanket is the "Hex Sticker Wall" that was on design during the conference, created by Mitchell O'Hara-Wild:

The design for the wall was created — naturally — using R. Mitchell created an R script that will arrange a folder of hexagon images according to a specified layout. He then used a map of Australia to lay out the hex sticker coordinates within the map boundaries and plotted that to create the Hexwall. If you have a similar collection of hex images you could use the same technique to arrange them into any shape you like. The details are provided in the blog post linked below.
