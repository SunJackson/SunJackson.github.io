A developer always pays his technical debts! And we have a debt to pay to the gods of coding best practices, as we did not present many unit tests for our functions yet. Today we will show how to efficiently investigate and improve unit test coverage for our R code, with focus on functions governing our RStudio addins, which have their own specifics.

> 
As a practical example, we will do a simple resctructuring of one of our functions to increase its test coverage from a mere 34% to over 90%.


The pretty rewards for your tests

Much has been written on the importance of unit testing, so we will not spend more time on convincing the readers, but rather very quickly provide a few references in case the reader is new to unit testing with R. In the later parts of the article we assume that these basics are known.

In a few words

- [`devtools`](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) – Makes package development easier by providing R functions that simplify common tasks

- [`testthat`](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat)– Is the most popular unit testing package for R

- [`covr`](https://github.com/r-lib/covr)– Helps track test coverage for R packages and view reports locally or (optionally) upload the results


For a start guide to use `testthat` within a package, visit the [Testing section](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) of R packages by Hadley Wickham. I would also recommend checking out the [showcase on the 2.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/testthat-2-0-0) release of the testthat itself.

For the purpose of investigating the test coverage of a package we can use the `covr` package. Within an R project, we can call the `package_coverage()` function to get a nicely printed high-level overview, or we can provide a specific path to a package root directory and call it as follows:

```
# This looks much prettier in the R console ;)
covr::package_coverage(pkgPath)
```

```
## jhaddins Coverage: 59.05%
```

```
## R/viewSelection.R: 34.15%
```

```
## R/addRoxytag.R: 40.91%
```

```
## R/makeCmd.R: 92.86%
```

For a deeper investigation, converting the results to a `data.frame` might be very useful. The below shows the count of number of times that given expression was called during the running of our tests for each group of code lines:

```
covResults <- covr::package_coverage(pkgPath)
as.data.frame(covResults)[, c(1:3, 5, 11)]
```

Calling `covr::zero_coverage` with a overage object returned by `package_coverage` will provide a data.frame with locations that have 0 test coverage. The nice thing about running it within RStudio is that it outputs the results on the Markers tab in RStudio, where we can easily investigate:

```
zeroCov <- covr::zero_coverage(covResults)
```

zero_coverage markers

Investigating our code, let us focus on the results for the `viewSelection.R`, which has a very weak 34% test coverage. We can analyze exactly which lines have no test coverage in a specific file:

```
zeroCov[zeroCov$filename == "R/viewSelection.R", "line"]
```

```
## [1] 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 61 64 65 66 69 70 71 74 76 77 79 81 82 83 88 89
## [24] 91 92 93 96
```

[Looking at the code](https://gitlab.com/jozefhajnala/jhaddins/blob/bd5979cecfbf4b81a6f8c02e5593fe109baed172/R/viewSelection.R), we can see that the first chuck of lines – 7:13 represent the `viewSelection` function, which just calls `lapply` and invisibly returns `NULL`.The main weak spot however is the function `viewObject`, out of which we only test the early return in case of invalid `chr` argument provided. None of the other functionality is tested.

The reason behind this is that when running the tests, RStudio functionality is not available and therefore we would not be able to test even the not-so-well designed return values, as they are almost always preceded by a call to `rstudioapi` or other RStudio-related functionality such as the object viewer, because that is what they are designed to do. This means we must restructure the code in such a way that we contain the RStudio-dependent functionality to a necessary minimum, keeping a big majority of the code testable – only calling the side-effecting `rstudioapi` when actually executing the addin functionality itself.

We will now show one potential way to solve this issue for the particular case of our `viewObject` function.

> 
The idea behind the solution is to only return the arguments for the call to the RStudio API related functionality, instead of executing them in the function itself – hence the rename to `getViewArgs`.


This way we can test the function’s return value against the expected arguments and only execute them with `do.call` in the addin execution wrapper itself. A picture may be worth a thousand words, so here is the diff with relevant changes:

Refactoring for testability

Now that our return values are testable across the entire `getViewArgs` function, we can easily write tests to cover the entire function, a couple examples:

```
test_that("getViewArgs for function"
 , expect_equal(
 getViewArgs("reshape")
 , list(what = "View", args = list(x = reshape, title = "reshape"))
 )
 )
```

```
test_that("getViewArgs for data.frame"
 , expect_equal(
 getViewArgs("datasets::women")
 , list(what = "View",
 args = list(x = data.frame(
 height = c(58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65,
 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72),
 weight = c(115, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135,
 139, 142, 146, 150, 154, 159, 164)
 ),
 title = "datasets::women"
 )
 )
 )
 )
```

Looking at the test coverage provided after our changes, we can see that we are at more than 90% percent coverage for `viewSelection.R`:

```
# This looks much prettier in the R console ;)
covResults <- covr::package_coverage(pkgPath)
covResults
```

```
## jhaddins Coverage: 82.05%
```

```
## R/addRoxytag.R: 40.91%
```

```
## R/viewSelection.R: 90.57%
```

```
## R/makeCmd.R: 92.86%
```

And looking at the lines that not covered for `viewSelection.R`, we can indeed see that the only uncovered lines left are in fact those with the `viewSelection` function, which is responsible only for executing the addin itself:

```
covResults <- as.data.frame(covResults)
covResults[covResults$filename == "R/viewSelection.R" &
 covResults$value == 0, c(1:3, 5, 11)]
```

```
## filename functions first_line last_line value
## 39 R/viewSelection.R viewSelection 13 17 0
## 40 R/viewSelection.R viewSelection 15 15 0
## 41 R/viewSelection.R viewSelection 16 16 0
```

In the ideal world we would of course want to also automate the testing of our addin execution itself by examining if their effects in the RStudio IDE are as expected, however this is far beyond the scope of this post. For some of our addin functionality we can however even directly test the side-effects, such as when the addin should produce a file with certain content.
