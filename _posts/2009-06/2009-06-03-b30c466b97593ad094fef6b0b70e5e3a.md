This is the third time I attempt to write the assumption system. Other
attempts could be described as me following the rule: “For any complex
problem, there is always a solution that is simple, clear, and wrong.”
My [first attempt](http://groups.google.com/group/sympy-patches/browse_thread/thread/b6fd5402e729f58/8006779044c41a17?lnk=gst&q=fabian+assumptions#8006779044c41a17) (although better than the current assumption system)
did use very rudimentary logic and was not very smart. It could infer
some basic rules, like Integer => Rational, but could not construct long
paths like Prime => Integer => Rational => Real => Complex. You would
have to specify by hand that prime numbers are also complex ... and this
just what makes the old assumption system unmanageable. I know that
state-of-the art CAS like Mathematica use advanced resolution techniques
to get [smart results](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/UsingAssumptions.html). And in the open source world, well, the only
CAS that I could find that has this sort of algorithms in Maxima, but in
order to understand that I would have to learn LISP, and ironically
enough I started to contribute to SymPy because I didn't feel like
learning LISP ...
