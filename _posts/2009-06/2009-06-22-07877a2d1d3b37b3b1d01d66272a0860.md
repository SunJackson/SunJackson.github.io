After some hacking on the queries module, I finally got it right without
the [limitations of past versions](http://fseoane.net/blog?p=149). You can check it out from my repo
[http://fseoane.net/git/sympy.git](http://fseoane.net/git/sympy.git), branch master. It now relies even more
on logic.inference.satisfiable(), which is just an implementation of the
[DPLL algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm). Bad news is that (my implementation of )
dpll_satisfiable() is SLOW, so inevitably queries are SLOW. But
everything is not lost, since the algorithm is quite fast, and in fact
other variants of the algorithm (MiniSAT) perform 6600x times faster
than my implementation on medium-sized problems (60 variables, 170
clauses). So this looks like something smells bad on the programming
side ... However, I spent the day profiling the function (link to
source code used for profiling) without much success
