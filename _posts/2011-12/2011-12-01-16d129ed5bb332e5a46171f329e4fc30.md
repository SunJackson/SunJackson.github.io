Donations come in spurts, but the running continues!


About halfway into my charity:water campaign ([donate here](http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater)), Iâ€™m pleased to say that Iâ€™ve raised $675! Translated into miles, thatâ€™s 67.5 miles, of which Iâ€™ve run 37.95 thus far.

The running is starting to get easier, but Iâ€™m starting to lose momentum on the donations side. Iâ€™ve thoroughly worked the Facebook Friends network, and with a little â€œEmbarrass Randyâ€� motivation, my co-workers have put up quite a bit of money. Itâ€™s funny how offering to run on the company treadmill on my normal work-from-home day can get people to cough up the dough. That, and the fact that they can drink beer and mock me during said runningâ€¦

But with those two personal networks tapped out, Iâ€™m going to have to start twisting arms pretty soon. Unless there are some [charitable readers](http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater) out there ğŸ™‚
