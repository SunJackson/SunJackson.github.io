As the year winds down to a close, we wanted to thank all of the
people — our clients, colleagues, independent contractors,
advisors, friends, and family — that have contributed to our success this year. As
a token of our gratitude, we put together a “map of Christmas
carols” for your holiday pleasure.



In the map, Christmas carols are represented by circles. The
similarity between the lyrics of carols is represented by the lines
between them; thicker, darker lines indicate that the carols are
more similar. It appears there are two visually distinct clusters of
carols, roughly corresponding with religious and secular carols!



Mouseover a circle to see the name of the
corresponding carol. Click on a circle to view the lyrics of the
carol. Click and drag a circle to move around the network.




Data for the diagram come
from an awesome
90s-era website. We use [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)
to remove stop
words
and [stem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) the
remaining text of the Christmas carols and we
use [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim) to assess
the similarity of carols based on the cosine similarity
between term
frequency–inverse-document frequency vectors. We then
construct a network of Christmas carols using the 150 most similar
pairs of Christmas carols and display everything
using [d3's](http://mbostock.github.com/d3) force-directed
network layout.



Happy Holidays!
