Version 0-1.17 of the **Rborist** package is buildingsuccessfully on CRAN. This is the last of the 0-1 series; future versions willinstead employ a more conventional API numbering scheme.

Two new command-line options have been introduced. Option *nThread*permits limiting the number of OpenMP threads employed in parallel regions ofcode. Option "oob" constrains prediction to out-of-bag samples, facilitatingthe computation of permutation-based variable importance.

The IR bridge has been considerably simplified. In particular, much of theheavy lifting involved in blocking *data.frame* objects is nowaccomplished by a single call to the **data.table** library.Package dependencies remain at two, now **Rcpp** and**data.table**.

In addition to bug repairs, memory footprint has also been diminished.Copies from core data structures to their R counterparts are now buffered,greatly smoothing a spike in resource usage encountered following training.

Special thanks to the CRAN team for their patience and their continuingeffort to improve build standards.
