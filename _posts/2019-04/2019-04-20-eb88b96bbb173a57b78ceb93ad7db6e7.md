**MobiRNN** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we explore optimizations to run Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models locally on mobile devices. RNN models are widely used for Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation, and other tasks. However, existing mobile applications that use RNN models do so on the cloud. To address privacy and efficiency concerns, we show how RNN models can be run locally on mobile devices. Existing work on porting deep learning models to mobile devices focus on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and cannot be applied directly to RNN models. In response, we present MobiRNN, a mobile-specific optimization framework that implements GPU offloading specifically for mobile GPUs. Evaluations using an RNN model for activity recognition shows that MobiRNN does significantly decrease the latency of running RNN models on phones. … 

**Graph Structured Recurrent Neural Network (GSRNN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present a generic framework for spatio-temporal (ST) data modeling, analysis, and forecasting, with a special focus on data that is sparse in both space and time. Our multi-scaled framework is a seamless coupling of two major components: a self-exciting point process that models the macroscale statistical behaviors of the ST data and a graph structured recurrent neural network (GSRNN) to discover the microscale patterns of the ST data on the inferred graph. This novel deep neural network (DNN) incorporates the real time interactions of the graph nodes to enable more accurate real time forecasting. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on both crime and traffic forecasting. … 

**Progressive Sampling-Based Bayesian Optimization** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Purpose: Machine learning is broadly used for clinical data analysis. Before training a model, a machine learning algorithm must be selected. Also, the values of one or more model parameters termed hyper-parameters must be set. Selecting algorithms and hyper-parameter values requires advanced machine learning knowledge and many labor-intensive manual iterations. To lower the bar to machine learning, miscellaneous automatic selection methods for algorithms and/or hyper-parameter values have been proposed. Existing automatic selection methods are inefficient on large data sets. This poses a challenge for using machine learning in the clinical big data era. Methods: To address the challenge, this paper presents progressive sampling-based Bayesian optimization, an efficient and automatic selection method for both algorithms and hyper-parameter values. Results: We report an implementation of the method. We show that compared to a state of the art automatic selection method, our method can significantly reduce search time, classification error rate, and standard deviation of error rate due to randomization. Conclusions: This is major progress towards enabling fast turnaround in identifying high-quality solutions required by many machine learning-based clinical data analysis tasks. …
