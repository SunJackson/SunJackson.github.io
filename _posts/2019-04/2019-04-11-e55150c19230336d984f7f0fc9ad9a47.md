## Introduction

Are you trying to compare price of products across websites? Are you trying tomonitor price changes every hour? Or planning to do some text mining orsentiment analysis on reviews of products or services? If yes, how would you dothat? How do you get the details available on the website into a format inwhich you can analyse it?

- Can you copy/paste the data from their website?

- Can you see some save button?

- Can you download the data?


Hmmm.. If you have these or similar questions on your mind, you have come tothe right place. In this post, we will learn about web scraping using R. Belowis a video tutorial which covers the intial part of this post.





The slides used in the above video tutorial can be foundhere.

## The What?

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_what_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)

What exactly is web scraping or web mining or web harvesting? It is atechnique for extracting data from websites. Remember, websites contain wealthof useful data but designed for human consumption and not data analysis. Thegoal of web scraping is to take advantage of the pattern or structure of webpages to extract and store data in a format suitable for data analysis.

## The Why?

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_why_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_why_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Now, let us understand why we may have to scrape data from the web.

- **Data Format**: As we said earlier, there is a wealth of data on websitesbut designed for human consumption. As such, we cannot use it for data analysisas it is not in a suitable format/shape/structure.

- **No copy/paste**: We cannot copy & paste the data into a local file. Even ifwe do it, it will not be in the required format for data analysis.

- **No save/download**: There are no options to save/download the required datafrom the websites. We cannot right click and save or click on a download buttonto extract the required data.

- **Automation**: With web scraping, we can automate the process of dataextraction/harvesting.


## Use Cases

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_use_cases_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_use_cases_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Below are few use cases of web scraping:

- **Contact Scraping**: Locate contact information including email addresses,phone numbers etc.

- **Monitoring/Comparing Prices**: How your competitors price their products,how your prices fit within your industry, and whether there are anyfluctuations that you can take advantage of.

- **Scraping Reviews/Ratings**: Scrape reviews of product/services and use itfor text mining/sentiment analysis etc.


## Libraries

We will use the following R packages in this tutorial.

```
library(robotstxt)
library(rvest)
library(selectr)
library(xml2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(tibble)
library(purrr)
```

## Best Selling Mobile Phones

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_cs_top_mobiles_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_cs_top_mobiles_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


In this first case study, we will scrape the details of best selling smartphones from Amazon.Our goal is to extract the following:

- Brand name

- Color

- Rating

- Number of reviews

- Real price

- Actual price (after discount)


### robotstxt

As mentioned earlier, we will first check if we can scrape data from the webpage using `paths_allowed()` from the **robotstxt** package. We need tospecify the url of the web page using the `paths` argument. If we can accessthe web page, `paths_allowed()` will return `TRUE`, else `FALSE`.

```
paths_allowed(
 paths = c("https://www.amazon.in/mobile-phones/b?ie=UTF8&node=1389401031&ref_=nav_shopall_sbc_mobcomp_all_mobiles")
)
```

```
## 
 www.amazon.in No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Since it has returned `TRUE`, let us go ahead and download the web page using`read_html()` from the **xml2** package and store it in `top_phones`. We dothis to ensure not to make repeated requests to the website which may lead toour IP address being blocked.

```
top_phones <- read_html("https://www.amazon.in/mobile-phones/b?ie=UTF8&node=1389401031&ref_=nav_shopall_sbc_mobcomp_all_mobiles")
top_phones
```

```
## {xml_document}

Brand Name
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_brand_name_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_brand_name_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)

The first detail we want to extract is the brand name of the phone. If you lookat the HTML code, it is nested within a hyperlink, defined by ``. The linkis inside a section identified by the class `crwTitle`. We will use thisinformation to ask **rvest** to extract text content which will give us thebrand name.
The location is specified using `html_nodes()` and the text extracted using`hmtl_text()`. Since `crwTitle` is a class, we use `.` before it but not for`a` as it is a HTML tag. Both the class and the tag are specified within quotesand separated by space.
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwTitle a") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "Samsung Galaxy M30 (Gradation Blue, 4+64 GB)" 
## [2] "Samsung Galaxy M20 (Ocean Blue, 4+64GB)" 
## [3] "Samsung Galaxy M30 (Gradation Black, 4+64 GB)" 
## [4] "Redmi 6A (Black, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage)" 
## [5] "Redmi 6 Pro (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)" 
## [6] "Samsung Galaxy M10 (Ocean Blue, 3+32GB)" 
## [7] "Redmi 6 Pro (Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)" 
## [8] "Realme U1 (Ambitious Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"
## [9] "Honor 8C (Blue, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage)" 
## [10] "OnePlus 6T (Mirror Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
```

If you observe the output, it includes the following:

- brand name

- color

- RAM

- storage capacity


To extract the brand name, we will do the following:

- use `str_split()` from **stringr** and specify the pattern `\\(` i.e splitthe string @ the first opening bracket. Since `(` is a special character, weuse `\\` for escaping.

- next, we use `map_chr()` from the **purrr** package to extract the firstelement from the resulting list.

- finally, we remove the white space using `str_trim()`.


The whole point of the above exercise is to show that extracting the datausing **rvest** is just one part of web scraping. We need to spend enoughtime tidying and reshaping the data to get it into a format useful for dataanalysis.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwTitle a") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_split('\\(') %>%
 map_chr(1) %>%
 str_trim() -> mobile_name

mobile_name
```

```
## [1] "Samsung Galaxy M30" "Samsung Galaxy M20" "Samsung Galaxy M30"
## [4] "Redmi 6A" "Redmi 6 Pro" "Samsung Galaxy M10"
## [7] "Redmi 6 Pro" "Realme U1" "Honor 8C" 
## [10] "OnePlus 6T"
```

### Color

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_color_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_color_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


In the previous step, we observed that the data extracted from `top_mobiles`included the color of the mobile as well. So the location of the color inthe HTML is same; within the hyperlink of the `crwTitle` section. But now,we want to extract the color and not the brand name.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwTitle a") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "Samsung Galaxy M30 (Gradation Blue, 4+64 GB)" 
## [2] "Samsung Galaxy M20 (Ocean Blue, 4+64GB)" 
## [3] "Samsung Galaxy M30 (Gradation Black, 4+64 GB)" 
## [4] "Redmi 6A (Black, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage)" 
## [5] "Redmi 6 Pro (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)" 
## [6] "Samsung Galaxy M10 (Ocean Blue, 3+32GB)" 
## [7] "Redmi 6 Pro (Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)" 
## [8] "Realme U1 (Ambitious Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"
## [9] "Honor 8C (Blue, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage)" 
## [10] "OnePlus 6T (Mirror Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"
```

We will split the original string @ `(` and extract the second part whichincludes:

- color

- RAM

- storage capacity


The color is separated from the rest by a comma. We will use the `,` to splitthe string and extract the color using `map_chr()` i.e. extract the firstelement from the resulting list.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwTitle a") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_split('\\(') %>%
 map_chr(2) %>%
 str_split(",") %>%
 map_chr(1) -> mobile_color

mobile_color
```

```
## [1] "Gradation Blue" "Ocean Blue" "Gradation Black"
## [4] "Black" "Black" "Ocean Blue" 
## [7] "Black" "Ambitious Black" "Blue" 
## [10] "Mirror Black"
```

### Rating

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_rating_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_rating_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Let us extract the ratings for the phones now. If you look at the HTML code,we can locate rating within the following:

It is wrapped within `` identified by the class `.a-icon-alt` which isinside a hyperlink in the section identified by the class `.crwProductDetail`.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail span .a-icon-alt") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "4.0 out of 5 stars" "3.7 out of 5 stars" "4.1 out of 5 stars"
## [4] "4.2 out of 5 stars" "4.2 out of 5 stars" "4.1 out of 5 stars"
## [7] "4.1 out of 5 stars" "4.4 out of 5 stars" "4.2 out of 5 stars"
## [10] "4.5 out of 5 stars"
```

In the outptut, you can observe the text **out of 5 stars** for each rating.Let us get rid of this text by selecting the first 3 characters using`str_sub()`. We pick the first 3 characters using the `start` and `end`arguments and supply them the values `1` and `3`. Finally, we convert therating to a number using `as.numeric()`.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail span .a-icon-alt") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_sub(start = 1, end = 3) %>%
 as.numeric() -> mobile_rating

mobile_rating
```

```
## [1] 4.0 3.7 4.1 4.2 4.2 4.1 4.1 4.4 4.2 4.5
```

### Number of Reviews

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_reviews_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_mobile_reviews_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Now that we know the rating for each of the top 10 best selling smart phones,let us find out how many people have reviewed them. The number of reviews islocated within the following:

- hyperlink identified by the class `.a-link-normal`

- `` tag identified by the class `.a-size-small`

- section identified by the class `.crwProductDetail`


```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail span.a-size-small .a-link-normal") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "1,100" "12,060" "553" "23,487" "6,403" "3,013" "12,366"
## [8] "10,413" "822" "14,379"
```

We use the above information within `html_nodes()` to extract the data. Nowlet us clean it up a bit and convert it into a number instead of leaving itas a character. If you use `as.numeric()` directly, you will see `NA` inthe result, the reason being the presence of comma in the number of reviews.First, we need to get rid of the comma, which we will do using `str_replace()`.We replace the comma with nothing as shown in the code below and then convertit into a number.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail span.a-size-small .a-link-normal") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_replace(",", "") %>%
 as.numeric() -> mobile_review

mobile_review
```

```
## [1] 1100 12060 553 23487 6403 3013 12366 10413 822 14379
```

### Real Price

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_real_price_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_real_price_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


The price is one of the most important factor when it comes to choosing asmart phone. Let us look at the price of the best selling mobile phones. Again,looking at the HTML code, the price can be located within the following:

- `` tag identified by the class `.a-text-strike`

- section identified by the class `crwPrice` and `.crwProductDetail`


```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail .crwPrice .a-text-strike") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "  Rs. 16,490.00" "  Rs. 13,390.00" "  Rs. 16,490.00"
## [4] "  Rs. 6,999.00" "  Rs. 11,499.00" "  Rs. 9,290.00" 
## [7] "  Rs. 13,499.00" "  Rs. 12,999.00" "  Rs. 12,999.00"
## [10] "  Rs. 37,999.00"
```

Using the above information, we can extract the price of the mobile phoneswhich is returned as a character vector but we need to convert it to numericif we are to analyze it further. Let use convert the price to a number usingthe following steps:

- use `str_trim()` to remove the white spaces

- exclude the currency information using `str_sub()`

- replace the comma using `str_replace()`

- remove the decimal values using `str_split()`

- extract the price from the resulting list using `map_chr()`

- convert the price to a number `using as.numeric()`


```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail .crwPrice .a-text-strike") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_trim() %>%
 str_sub(start = 5) %>%
 str_replace(",", "") %>%
 str_split("\\.") %>%
 map_chr(1) %>%
 as.numeric() -> real_price

real_price
```

```
## [1] 16490 13390 16490 6999 11499 9290 13499 12999 12999 37999
```

### Actual Price

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_actual_price_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_actual_price_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Deep discounts are one of the strategies adopted by ecommerce firms to drivesales. Let us look at the actual price (after discount price) of the bestselling mobile phones. The discounted price can be located within thefollowing:

- `` tag identified by the class `.crwActualPrice`

- section identified by the class `crwPrice` and `.crwProductDetail`


Using the above information, we can extract the discounted price of the mobilephones.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail .crwActualPrice") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "  Rs. 14,990.00" "  Rs. 12,990.00" "  Rs. 14,990.00"
## [4] "  Rs. 5,999.00" "  Rs. 7,999.00" "  Rs. 8,990.00" 
## [7] "  Rs. 10,000.00" "  Rs. 9,999.00" "  Rs. 10,999.00"
## [10] "  Rs. 34,999.00"
```

Let use convert the price to a number using the same steps as in thecase of real price.

```
top_phones %>%
 html_nodes(".crwProductDetail .crwActualPrice") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_trim() %>%
 str_sub(start = 5) %>%
 str_replace(",", "") %>%
 str_split("\\.") %>%
 map_chr(1) %>%
 as.numeric() -> discounted_price

discounted_price
```

```
## [1] 14990 12990 14990 5999 7999 8990 10000 9999 10999 34999
```

## IMDB Top 50

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_cs_imdb_top_50_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_cs_imdb_top_50_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


In this case study, we will extract the following details of the top 50 moviesfrom the IMDB website:

- title

- year of release

- certificate

- runtime

- genre

- rating

- votes

- revenue


### robotstxt

Let us check if we can scrape the data from the website using `paths_allowed()`from **robotstxt** package.

```
paths_allowed(
 paths = c("https://www.imdb.com/search/title?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating")
)
```

```
## 
 www.imdb.com No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Since it has returned `TRUE`, we will go ahead and download the web page using`read_html()` from **xml2** package.

```
imdb <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/search/title?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating")
imdb
```

```
## {xml_document}
## 
## [1] \n\n\n 
Title

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_name_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)

As we did in the previous case study, we will look at the HTML code of the IMDBweb page and locate the title of the movies in the following way:

- hyperlink inside `` tag
- section identified with the class `.lister-item-content`

In other words, the title of the movie is inside a hyperlink (``) whichis inside a level 3 heading (``) within a section identified by the class`.lister-item-content`.
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(".lister-item-content h3 a") %>%
 html_text() -> movie_title

movie_title
```

```
## [1] "The Shawshank Redemption" 
## [2] "The Godfather" 
## [3] "The Dark Knight" 
## [4] "The Godfather: Part II" 
## [5] "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" 
## [6] "Pulp Fiction" 
## [7] "Schindler's List" 
## [8] "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo" 
## [9] "12 Angry Men" 
## [10] "Inception" 
## [11] "Fight Club" 
## [12] "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"

## [19] "Shichinin no samurai" 
## [20] "Interstellar" 
## [21] "Cidade de Deus" 
## [22] "Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi" 
## [23] "Saving Private Ryan" 
## [24] "The Green Mile" 
## [25] "La vita è bella" 
## [26] "The Usual Suspects" 
## [27] "Se7en" 
## [28] "Léon" 
## [29] "The Silence of the Lambs" 
## [30] "Star Wars" 
## [31] "It's a Wonderful Life" 
## [32] "Andhadhun" 
## [33] "Dangal" 
## [34] "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" 
## [35] "Avengers: Infinity War" 
## [36] "Whiplash" 
## [37] "The Intouchables" 
## [38] "The Prestige" 
## [39] "The Departed"

## [41] "Memento" 
## [42] "Gladiator" 
## [43] "American History X" 
## [44] "The Lion King" 
## [45] "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" 
## [46] "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" 
## [47] "Hotaru no haka" 
## [48] "Back to the Future" 
## [49] "Raiders of the Lost Ark" 
## [50] "Apocalypse Now"
```

### Year of Release

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_year_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_year_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


The year in which a movie was released can be located in the following way:

- `` tag identified by the class `.lister-item-year`

- nested inside a level 3 heading (``)

- part of section identified by the class `.lister-item-content`


```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(".lister-item-content h3 .lister-item-year") %>%
 html_text() 
```

```
## [1] "(1994)" "(1972)" "(2008)" "(1974)" "(2003)" "(1994)" "(1993)"
## [8] "(1966)" "(1957)" "(2010)" "(1999)" "(2001)" "(1994)" "(2002)"
## [15] "(1999)" "(1990)" "(1980)" "(1975)" "(1954)" "(2014)" "(2002)"
## [22] "(2001)" "(1998)" "(1999)" "(1997)" "(1995)" "(1995)" "(1994)"
## [29] "(1991)" "(1977)" "(1946)" "(2018)" "(2016)" "(2018)" "(2018)"
## [36] "(2014)" "(2011)" "(2006)" "(2006)" "(2002)" "(2000)" "(2000)"
## [43] "(1998)" "(1994)" "(1991)" "(1988)" "(1988)" "(1985)" "(1981)"
## [50] "(1979)"
```

If you look at the output, the year is enclosed in round brackets and is acharacter vector. We need to do 2 things now:

- remove the round bracket

- convert year to class `Date` instead of character


We will use `str_sub()` to extract the year and convert it to `Date` using`as.Date()` with the format `%Y`. Finally, we use `year()` from **lubridate**package to extract the year from the previous step.

```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(".lister-item-content h3 .lister-item-year") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_sub(start = 2, end = 5) %>%
 as.Date(format = "%Y") %>%
 year() -> movie_year

movie_year
```

```
## [1] 1994 1972 2008 1974 2003 1994 1993 1966 1957 2010 1999 2001 1994 2002
## [15] 1999 1990 1980 1975 1954 2014 2002 2001 1998 1999 1997 1995 1995 1994
## [29] 1991 1977 1946 2018 2016 2018 2018 2014 2011 2006 2006 2002 2000 2000
## [43] 1998 1994 1991 1988 1988 1985 1981 1979
```

### Certificate

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_certificate_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_certificate_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)

## [50] "147 min"
If you look at the output, it includes the text **min** and is of type`character`. We need to do 2 things here:

```
## [1] "142 min" "175 min" "152 min" "202 min" "201 min" "154 min" "195 min"
## [8] "161 min" "96 min" "148 min" "139 min" "178 min" "142 min" "179 min"
## [15] "136 min" "146 min" "124 min" "133 min" "207 min" "169 min" "130 min"
## [22] "125 min" "169 min" "189 min" "116 min" "106 min" "127 min" "110 min"

## [43] "119 min" "88 min" "137 min" "155 min" "89 min" "116 min" "115 min"
## [50] "147 min"
```

- remove the text **min**

- convert to type `numeric`


We will try the following:

- use `str_split()` to split the result using space as a separator

- extract the first element from the resulting list using `map_chr()`

- use `as.numeric()` to convert to a number


```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(".lister-item-content p .runtime") %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_split(" ") %>%
 map_chr(1) %>%
 as.numeric() -> movie_runtime

movie_runtime
```

### Rating

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_rating_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_rating_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


The rating of the movie can be located in the following way:

- part of the section identified by the class `.ratings-imdb-rating`

- nested within the section identified by the class `.ratings-bar`

- the rating is present within the `****` tag as well as in the`data-value` attribute

- instead of using `html_text()`, we will use `html_attr()` to extract thevalue of the attribute `data-value`


Try using `html_text()` and see what happens! You may include the `****` tagor the classes associated with `` tag as well.

```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(".ratings-bar .ratings-imdb-rating") %>%
 html_attr("data-value") 
```

```
## [1] "9.3" "9.2" "9" "9" "8.9" "8.9" "8.9" "8.9" "8.9" "8.8" "8.8"
## [12] "8.8" "8.8" "8.7" "8.7" "8.7" "8.7" "8.7" "8.7" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6"
## [23] "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.6" "8.5" "8.5"
## [34] "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5"
## [45] "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5" "8.5"
```

Since rating is returned as a character vector, we will use `as.numeric()` toconvert it into a number.

```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(".ratings-bar .ratings-imdb-rating") %>%
 html_attr("data-value") %>% 
 as.numeric() -> movie_rating

movie_rating
```

```
## [1] 9.3 9.2 9.0 9.0 8.9 8.9 8.9 8.9 8.9 8.8 8.8 8.8 8.8 8.7 8.7 8.7 8.7
## [18] 8.7 8.7 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.6 8.5 8.5 8.5
## [35] 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5
```

### XPATH

To extract votes from the web page, we will use a different technique. In thiscase, we will use **xpath** and **attributes** to locate the total number ofvotes received by the top 50 movies.

**xpath** is specified using the following:

- tab

- attribute name

- attribute value


### Votes

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_votes_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_votes_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
In case of votes, they are the following:

- `meta`

- `itemprop`

- `ratingCount`


Next, we are not looking to extract text value as we did in the previous examplesusing `html_text()`. Here, we need to extract the value assigned to the`content` attribute within the `` tag using `html_attr()`.

```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(xpath = '//meta[@itemprop="ratingCount"]') %>% 
 html_attr('content') 
```

```
## [1] "2072234" "1421858" "2038192" "986722" "1475228" "1620525" "1073941"
## [8] "615037" "585330" "1816814" "1658255" "1491788" "1588549" "1334175"
## [15] "1488615" "894737" "1039788" "822026" "279949" "1276303" "637576" 
## [22] "549215" "1095877" "1000529" "545073" "897347" "1271115" "913037" 
## [29] "1118408" "1109433" "352753" "38978" "118321" "172855" "616710" 
## [36] "605162" "666065" "1052597" "1063762" "633432" "1021256" "1197974"
## [43] "941670" "822889" "897372" "198316" "192593" "922864" "802805" 
## [50] "542139"
```

Finally, we convert the votes to a number using `as.numeric()`.

```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(xpath = '//meta[@itemprop="ratingCount"]') %>% 
 html_attr('content') %>% 
 as.numeric() -> movie_votes

movie_votes
```

```
## [1] 2072234 1421858 2038192 986722 1475228 1620525 1073941 615037
## [9] 585330 1816814 1658255 1491788 1588549 1334175 1488615 894737
## [17] 1039788 822026 279949 1276303 637576 549215 1095877 1000529
## [25] 545073 897347 1271115 913037 1118408 1109433 352753 38978
## [33] 118321 172855 616710 605162 666065 1052597 1063762 633432
## [41] 1021256 1197974 941670 822889 897372 198316 192593 922864
## [49] 802805 542139
```

### Revenue

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_revenue_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/blog_ws_imdb_movie_revenue_border.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


We wanted to extract both revenue and votes without using **xpath** but the wayin which they are structured in the HTML code forced us to use **xpath** toextract votes. If you look at the HTML code, both votes and revenue are locatedinside the same tag with the same attribute name and value i.e. there is nodistinct way to identify either of them.

In case of revenue, the **xpath** details are as follows:

Next, we will use `html_text()` to extract the revenue.

```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(xpath = '//span[@name="nv"]') %>%
 html_text() 
```

```

To extract the revenue as a number, we need to do some string hacking asfollows:

- extract values that begin with `$`

- omit missing values

- convert values to character using `as.character()`

- append NA where revenue is missing (rank 31 and 47)

- remove `$` and `M`

- convert to number using `as.numeric()`


```
imdb %>%
 html_nodes(xpath = '//span[@name="nv"]') %>%
 html_text() %>%
 str_extract(pattern = "^\\$.*") %>%
 na.omit() %>%
 as.character() %>%
 append(values = NA, after = 30) %>%
 append(values = NA, after = 46) %>%
 str_sub(start = 2, end = nchar(.) - 1) %>%
 as.numeric() -> movie_revenue

movie_revenue
```
