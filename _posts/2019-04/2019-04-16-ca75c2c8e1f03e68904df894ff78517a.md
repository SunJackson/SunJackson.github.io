"Hi Igor,

I hope you are doing well. I'm contacting you to let you know about the first edition of Khipu: an annual LATAM meeting in AI that will be held in Facultad de IngenierÃ­a (UdelaR), Montevideo, Uruguay, Nov. 11-15, 2019. The main goal of the event is to strengthen the AI local community by bringing high level training and by fostering research collaborations within and outside the region.

We'll have terrific speakers! Among the confirmed speakers is Yoshua Bengio (Turing award) and Jeff Dean (Google Senior Fellow). Full list of confirmed speakers is at https://khipu.ai.

We'd really appreciate it if you help us spread the announcement below so that we can reach as many people (in particular Latin American students/researchers) as possible!

Thanks a lot and congratulations on the blog. I'm a huge fan :)

best,mauricio"
