**The *Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision* Kickstarter is officially LIVE!**

To back the Kickstarter campaign (and claim your copy of RPi for CV/my other books and courses at the 15-25% OFF discounted rates), just use the link below:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adrianrosebrock/raspberry-pi-for-computer-vision-ebook?ref=project_build

And remember, **I’m offering an *additional 15% OFF the already discounted bundle prices *for the *first 10 minutes* of the campaign.** (10:00-10:10AM EDT). This is a *massive* savings of 30-35% the *entire* PyImageSearch library.

But as soon as the clock hits 10:10AM EDT I’m taking down the additional discount. *No exceptions* (but you’ll still be getting a great deal from the special Kickstarter pricing though).

If you’d like to take advantage of the special pricing, ***you’ll definitely want to act now!***

My hope is that you’ll use this opportunity to make the most of the sale and continue studying computer vision, deep learning, and OpenCV. **I’ll be with you every step of the way.**

Thank you so much for being supportive of myself and the PyImageSearch blog.

I hope to see you on the other side.
