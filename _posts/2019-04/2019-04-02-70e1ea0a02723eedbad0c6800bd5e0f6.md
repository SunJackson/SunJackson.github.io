random_files <- function(path, percent_number, pattern = "wav$|WAV$"){
 ####################################################################
 # path = path to folder with files to select 
 # 
 # percent_number = percentage or number of recordings to select. If value is 
 # between 0 and 1 percentage of files is assumed, if value greater than 1, 
 # number of files is assumed 
 # 
 # pattern = file extension to select. By default it selects wav files. For 
 # other type of files replace wav and WAV by the desired extension 
 ####################################################################
 
 # Get file list with full path and file names
 files <- list.files(path, full.names = TRUE, pattern = pattern)
 file_names <- list.files(path, pattern = pattern)
 
 # Select the desired % or number of file by simple random sampling 
 randomize <- sample(seq(files))
 files2analyse <- files[randomize]
 names2analyse <- file_names[randomize]
 if(percent_number <= 1){
 size <- floor(percent_number * length(files))
 }else{
 size <- percent_number
 }
 files2analyse <- files2analyse[(1:size)]
 names2analyse <- names2analyse[(1:size)]

 # Create folder to output
 results_folder <- paste0(path, '/selected')
 dir.create(results_folder, recursive=TRUE)
 
 # Write csv with file names
 write.table(names2analyse, file = paste0(results_folder, "/selected_files.csv"),
 col.names = "Files", row.names = FALSE)
 
 # Move files
 for(i in seq(files2analyse)){
 file.rename(from = files2analyse[i], to = paste0(results_folder, "/", names2analyse[i]) )
 }
}
 

I normally use this function inside a little script for some extra functionalities:

1. first I set up the environment by sourcing the required functions and loading the packages,

1. as I always do when using functions that use randomness, I set a seed to be able to reproduce my results in a later time,

1. as the function uses a folder path, I’ve included a little search window with tcltk to select the folder instead of having to write the full path by hand.


```
# Load packages and functions
require(tcltk)
source("random_files.R")

# Set seed to reproduce results
set.seed(1001)

# Select folder with recordings
path <- tcltk::tk_choose.dir()

# Percentage or number of recordings
percent_number <- 0.2 # using percentage

# Random sampling of files
random_files(path, percent_number, pattern = "wav$|WAV$")
```

This function was written for a specific purpose but with some tweaks you can probably adapt it for other purposes other than the one I use it for.
