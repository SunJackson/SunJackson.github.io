**Deep Learning Optimizer Benchmark Suite (DeepOBS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Because the choice and tuning of the optimizer affects the speed, and ultimately the performance of deep learning, there is significant past and recent research in this area. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, there is no generally agreed-upon protocol for the quantitative and reproducible evaluation of optimization strategies for deep learning. We suggest routines and benchmarks for stochastic optimization, with special focus on the unique aspects of deep learning, such as stochasticity, tunability and generalization. As the primary contribution, we present DeepOBS, a Python package of deep learning optimization benchmarks. The package addresses key challenges in the quantitative assessment of stochastic optimizers, and automates most steps of benchmarking. The library includes a wide and extensible set of ready-to-use realistic optimization problems, such as training Residual Networks for image classification on ImageNet or character-level language prediction models, as well as popular classics like MNIST and CIFAR-10. The package also provides realistic baseline results for the most popular optimizers on these test problems, ensuring a fair comparison to the competition when benchmarking new optimizers, and without having to run costly experiments. It comes with output back-ends that directly produce LaTeX code for inclusion in academic publications. It supports TensorFlow and is available open source. … 

**Temporal Bibliographic Network** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present two ways (instantaneous and cumulative) to transform bibliographic networks, using the works’ publication year, into corresponding temporal networks based on temporal quantities. We also show how to use the addition of temporal quantities to define interesting temporal properties of nodes, links and their groups thus providing an insight into evolution of bibliographic networks. Using the multiplication of temporal networks we obtain different derived temporal networks providing us with new views on studied networks. The proposed approach is illustrated with examples from the collection of bibliographic networks on peer review. … 

**Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been applied to many tasks including Web search, link prediction, recommendation, natural language processing, and entity linking. However, most KGs are far from complete and are growing at a rapid pace. To address these problems, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has been proposed to improve KGs by filling in its missing connections. Unlike existing methods which hold a closed-world assumption, i.e., where KGs are fixed and new entities cannot be easily added, in the present work we relax this assumption and propose a new open-world KGC task. As a first attempt to solve this task we introduce an open-world KGC model called ConMask. This model learns embeddings of the entity’s name and parts of its text-description to connect unseen entities to the KG. To mitigate the presence of noisy text descriptions, ConMask uses a relationship-dependent content masking to extract relevant snippets and then trains a fully convolutional neural network to fuse the extracted snippets with entities in the KG. Experiments on large data sets, both old and new, show that ConMask performs well in the open-world KGC task and even outperforms existing KGC models on the standard closed-world KGC task. …
