***Learning a language is easy.*** Whenever I start with a new language, I focus on a few things in below order, and it is a breeze to get started with writing code in any language.

- Operators and Data Types: +,-,int,float,str

- Conditional statements: if,else,case,switch

- Loops: For, while

- Data structures: List, Array, Dict, Hashmaps

- Define Function


***However, learning to write a language and writing a language in an optimized way are two different things.***

Every Language has some ingredients which make it unique.

Yet, ***a new programmer to any language will always do some forced overfitting.*** A Java programmer, new to python, for example, might write this code to add numbers in a list.

```
x=[1,2,3,4,5]

sum_x = 0
for i in range(len(x)):
 sum_x+=x[i]
```

While a python programmer will naturally do this:

In this series of posts named **‘Python Shorts’**, I will explain some simple constructs that Python provides, some essential tips and some use cases I come up with regularly in my Data Science work.

***This series is about efficient and readable code.***

## Counter and defaultdict — Use Cases
![](https://mlwhiz.com/images/python1/hamlet_img.jpg)


**Let’s say I need to count the number of word occurrences in a piece of text.** Maybe for a book like Hamlet. How could I do that?

Python always provides us with multiple ways to do the same thing. But only one way that I find elegant.

This is a ***Naive Python implementation*** using the dict object.

```
text = "I need to count the number of word occurrences in a piece of text. How could I do that? Python provides us with multiple ways to do the same thing. But only one way I find beautiful."

word_count_dict = {}
for w in text.split(" "):
 if w in word_count_dict:
 word_count_dict[w]+=1
 else:
 word_count_dict[w]=1
```

We could use ***defaultdict*** to reduce the number of lines in the code.

```
from Collections import defaultdict
word_count_dict = defaultdict(int)
for w in text.split(" "):
 word_count_dict[w]+=1
```

We could also have used ***Counter*** to do this.

```
from Collections import Counter
word_count_dict = Counter()
for w in text.split(" "):
 word_count_dict[w]+=1
```

If we use Counter, we can also get the most common words using a simple function.

```
word_count_dict.most_common(10)
---------------------------------------------------------------
[('I', 3), ('to', 2), ('the', 2)]
```

Other use cases of Counter:

```
# Count Characters
Counter('abccccccddddd')
---------------------------------------------------------------
Counter({'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 6, 'd': 5})

# Count List elements
Counter([1,2,3,4,5,1,2])
---------------------------------------------------------------
Counter({1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1})
```

## So, why ever use defaultdict ?

Notice that in Counter, the value is always an integer.

What if we wanted to parse through a list of tuples and wanted to create a dictionary of key and list of values.

The main functionality provided by a defaultdict is that it defaults a key to empty/zero if it is not found in the defaultdict.

```
s = [('color', 'blue'), ('color', 'orange'), ('color', 'yellow'), ('fruit', 'banana'), ('fruit', 'orange'),('fruit','banana')]

d = defaultdict(list)

for k, v in s:
 d[k].append(v)

print(d)
---------------------------------------------------------------
defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'color': ['blue', 'orange', 'yellow'], 'fruit': ['banana', 'orange', 'banana']})
```

banana comes two times in fruit, we could use set

```
d = defaultdict(set)

for k, v in s:
 d[k].add(v)

print(d)
---------------------------------------------------------------
{% raw %}
defaultdict(<class 'set'>, {'color': {'yellow', 'blue', 'orange'}, 'fruit': {'banana', 'orange'}})
{% endraw %}
```

## Conclusion

To conclude, I will say that ***there is always a beautiful way to do anything in Python***. Search for it before you write code. Going to StackOverflow is okay. I go there a lot of times when I get stuck. Always Remember:

> 
Creating a function for what already is provided is not pythonic.
