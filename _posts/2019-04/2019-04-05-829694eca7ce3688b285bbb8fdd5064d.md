We are thrilled to announce that **Julia Silge** from Stack Overflow will join us at EARL London (10-12 September) as a keynote speaker. After wowing us all at EARL Seattle last year we knew we had to get Julia over to London!

### About Julia Silge

Julia Silge is a data scientist at Stack Overflow, with a PhD in astrophysics and an abiding love for Jane Austen. She is both an international keynote speaker and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. She is the author of *Text Mining with R*, with her coauthor David Robinson. She loves making beautiful charts and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.

We will be shortly interviewing Julia to find out her views on all things R and what she is looking forward to at this year’s EARL.

If you’d like to join Julia as a speaker you have until 8 April to submit your abstract!
