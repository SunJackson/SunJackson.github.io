Installing R packages on Linux systems has always been a risky affair. In RStudioPackage Manager 1.0.8, we’re giving administrators and R users the informationthey need to make installing packages easier. We’ve also made iteasier to use Package Manager offline and improved search performance.

## Updates

### Introducing System Prerequisites

R packages can depend on one another, but they can also depend on softwareexternal to the R ecosystem. On Ubuntu 18.04, for example, in order to install the `curl` R package, you must have previously run `apt-get install libcurl`. Rpackages often note these dependencies inside their DESCRIPTION files, but thisinformation is free-form text that varies by package. In the past, systemadministrators would need to manually parse these files. In order to install`ggplot2`, you’d need to look at the system requirements for `ggplot2` and allits dependencies. This labor-intensive process rarely goes smoothly. Frequently,system dependencies are not be uncovered until a package failed to install,often with a cryptic error message that can leave R users and administrators franticallysearching StackOverflow.

To address this problem, we’ve begun cataloging and testingsystemprerequisites.The result is a list of install commands available for administrators and Rusers. We’ve tested this list by installing all 14,024 CRAN packages across sixLinux distributions.

For any package, Package Manager shows you if there are system pre-requisitesand the commands you can use to install them. Today this support is limited toLinux, but we plan to support Windows and Mac requirements in the future.Package Manager automatically rolls up prerequisites for dependent R packages.As an example, the `httr` R package depends on the `curl` package which dependson `libcurl`. Package Manager will show the `libcurl` prerequisite for the`httr` package–and for all of `httr`’s reverse dependencies!

### New Offline and Air-Gapped Downloader

In most cases, RStudio Package Manager provides the checks and governancecontrols needed by IT to bridge the gap between offline production systems andRStudio’s public CRAN service. However, in certain cases it may be necessary torun RStudio Package Manager offline. Version 1.0.8 introduces a newtool to help offlinecustomers. A new utility has been created to make cloning packages into anair-gapped environment safe and fast.

## Other Improvements

In addition to these major changes, the new release includes the following updates:

- Support for using Amazon S3 for storage is out of beta and ready for production systems.

- Logs for Git sources have been improved, making it easier to track down cases where a repository fails to build.

- Package search and listing performance has been significantly improved.

- The support for README files introduced in version 1.0.6 has been expanded to better support READMEs with links, badges, and images.
