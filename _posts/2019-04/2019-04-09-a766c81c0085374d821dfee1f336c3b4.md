Garmin Connect has a number of plots built in, but to take a deeper dive into all your fitness data, you need to export a CSV and fire up R. This post is a quick guide to some possibilities for running data. 

There’s a few things that I wanted to look at. For example, how does my speed change through the year? How does that compare to previous years? If I see some trends, is that the same for short runs and long runs? I wanted to look at the cumulative distance I’d run each year… There’s a lot of things that would be good to analyse.

Garmin Connect has a simple way to export data as a CSV. There are other ways to get your data, but the web interface is pretty straightforward. To export a CSV of your data, head to the Garmin Connect website, login and select Activities, All Activities. On this page, filter the activities for whatever you want to export. I clicked Running (you can filter some more if you want), and then scrolled down letting the data load onto the page until I went back as far as I wanted. In the top right corner, you click Export CSV and you will download whatever is displayed on the page.

The code to generate these plots, together with some fake data to play with can be found here.

Now in R, load in the CSV file

We have a data frame, but we need to rejig the Dates and a few other columns before we can start making plots.

Now we can make the first plot. The code for the first one is below, with all the code for the other plots shown below that.

The remainder of the code for the other plots is shown below. The code is commented. For some of the plots, a bit of extra work on the data frame is required.

Finally, we can save all of the plots using ggsave.

I think the code might fail if you don’t record all of the fields that I do. For example if heart rate data is missing or stride length is not recorded, I’m not sure what the code will do. The aim here is to give an idea of what sorts of plots can be generated just using the summary data in the CSV provided by Garmin. Feel free to make suggestions in the comments below.

The post title comes from “Garmonbozia” by Superdrag from the Regretfully Yours album. Apparently Garmonbozia is something eaten by the demons in the Black Lodge in the TV series Twin Peaks.
