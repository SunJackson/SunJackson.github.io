Motivation I initially made an close-access image for DigitalOcean because I wanted to spend my lectures and workshops giving useful examples and not solving software installation issues. Now you can use my RStudio image which available on DigitalOcean Marketplace, it costs $0 except for the cost of running the server, and it’s also scalable.For novice users, installing R can be hard, that’s why I wrote a guide with videos in english here and I translated it to spanish here.
