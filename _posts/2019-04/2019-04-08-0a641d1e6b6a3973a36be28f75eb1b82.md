One feature of R (could be positive, could be negative) is that there are many ways to do the same thing. In this post, I list out the different ways we can get certain results from a linear regression model. Feel free to comment if you know more ways other than those listed!

In what follows, we will use the linear regression object `lmfit`:

**Extracting coefficients of the linear model**

**Getting fitted values for the training data set**

**Getting residuals for the training data set**
