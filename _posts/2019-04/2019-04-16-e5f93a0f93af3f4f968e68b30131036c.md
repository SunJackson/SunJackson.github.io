Back in 2017 we ran a series of articles looking at the Best Masters in Data Science and Analytics, looking at Online courses, courses in America/Canada and in Europe. Well, weâ€™ve updated that list now with the latest details, fees and university rankings, as well as adding a whole bunch of new countries and courses.

As before, the costs are limited to full-time tuition and most of them do not include living expenses like transportation and housing. The tuition currency we have used is USD (converted price as of 6th April 2019), for simplicity and generality and the fees shown are for the 2019-20 academic year. Weâ€™ve also included a World University Computer Science ranking where applicable. The programs listed here are all campus-based, i.e., we have not included online degrees.

We have made a strong effort to include programs for all budgets, interests, locations, and curriculum. Feel free to share any additional program you think might improve the diversity of this compilation.
