Great data science work should be reproducible. The ability to repeatexperiments is part of the foundation for all science, and reproducible work isalso critical for business applications. Team collaboration, project validation,and sustainable products presuppose the ability to reproduce work over time.

In my opinion, mastering just a handful of important tools will makereproducible work in R much easier for data scientists. R users should befamiliar with version control, RStudio projects, and literate programmingthrough R Markdown. Once these tools are mastered, the major remaining challengeis creating a reproducible environment.

An environment consists of all the dependencies required to enable your code torun correctly. This includes R itself, R packages, and system dependencies. Aswith many programming languages, it can be challenging to manage reproducible Renvironments. Common issues include:

Code that used to run no longer runs, even though the code has not changed.

Being afraid to upgrade or install a new package, because it might break your code or someone else’s.

- Typing `install.packages` in your environment doesn’t do anything, or doesn’t do the *right* thing.


These challenges can be addressed through a careful combination of tools andstrategies. This post describes two use cases for reproducible environments:

1. Safely upgrading packages

1. Collaborating on a team


The sections below each cover a strategy to address the use case, and the necessarytools to implement each strategy. Additional use cases, strategies, and tools arepresented at https://environments.rstudio.com. This website is a work inprogress, but we look forward to your feedback.

## Safely Upgrading Packages

Upgrading packages can be a risky affair. It is not difficult to find serious Rusers who have been in a situation where upgrading a package had unintendedconsequences. For example, the upgrade may have broken parts of their current code, or upgrading apackage for one project accidentally broke the code in another project. Astrategy for safely upgrading packages consists of three steps:

1. Isolate a project

1. Record the current dependencies

1. Upgrade packages


The first step in this strategy ensures one project’s packages and upgradeswon’t interfere with any other projects. Isolating projects is accomplished bycreating per-project libraries. A tool that makes this easy is the new `renv`package. Inside of your R project, simply use:

```
# inside the project directory
renv::init()
```

The second step is to record the current dependencies. This step is criticalbecause it creates a safety net. If the package upgrade goes poorly, you’ll beable to revert the changes and return to the record of the working state. Again,the `renv` package makes this process easy.

```
# record the current dependencies in a file called renv.lock
renv::snapshot()

# commit the lockfile alongside your code in version control
# and use this function to view the history of your lockfile
renv::history()

# if an upgrade goes astray, revert the lockfile
renv::revert(commit = "abc123")

# and restore the previous environment
renv::restore()
```

With an isolated project and a safety net in place, you can now proceed toupgrade or add new packages, while remaining certain the current functionalenvironment is still reproducible. The `pak`package can be used to install and upgradepackages in an interactive environment:

```
# upgrade packages quickly and safely
pak::pkg_install("ggplot2")
```

The safety net provided by the `renv` package relies on access to older versionsof R packages. For public packages, CRAN provides these older versions in theCRAN archive. Organizations canuse tools like RStudio PackageManager to make multiple versionsof private packages available. The “snapshot andrestore” approach can also be usedto promote content to production. Infact, this approach is exactly how RStudioConnect andshinyapps.io deploy thousands of R applications toproduction each day!

## Team Collaboration

A common challenge on teams is sharing and running code. One strategy thatadministrators and R users can adopt to facilitate collaboration isshared baselines. The basics of the strategy are simple:

1. Administrators setup a common environment for R users by installing RStudio Server.

1. On the server, administrators install multiple versions of R.

1. Each version of R is tied to a frozen repository using a Rprofile.site file.


By using a frozen repository, either administrators or users can installpackages while still being sure that everyone will get the same set of packages.A frozen repository also ensures that adding new packages won’t upgrade othershared packages as a side-effect. New packages and upgrades are offered to usersover time through the addition of new versions of R.

Frozen repositories can be created by manually cloning CRAN, accessing a servicelike MRAN, or utilizing a supported product like RStudio PackageManager.

## Adaptable Strategies

The prior sections presented specific strategies for creating reproducibleenvironments in two common cases. The same strategy may not be appropriate forevery organization, R user, or situation. If you’re a student reporting anerror to your professor, capturing your `sessionInfo()` may be all you need. Incontrast, a statistician working on a clinical trial will need a robustframework for recreating their environment. **Reproducibility is not binary!**

To help pick between strategies, we’ve developed a strategymap. By answering two questions,you can quickly identify where your team falls on this map and identify thenearest successful strategy. The two questions are represented on the x andy-axis of the map:

1. Do I have any restrictions on what packages can be used?

1. Who is responsible for managing installed packages?





For more information on picking and using these strategies, please visithttps://environments.rstudio.com. By adopting a strategy for reproducibleenvironments, R users, administrators, and teams can solve a number of importantchallenges. Ultimately, reproducible work adds credibility, creating a solidfoundation for research, business applications, and production systems. We areexcited to be working on tools to make reproducible work in R easy and fun. Welook forward to your feedback, community discussions, and future posts.
