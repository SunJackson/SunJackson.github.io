**Fast Temporal Pattern Mining with Extended Vertical Lists** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Temporal Pattern Mining (TPM) is the problem of mining predictive complex temporal patterns from multivariate time series in a supervised setting. We develop a new method called the Fast Temporal Pattern Mining with Extended Vertical Lists. This method utilizes an extension of the Apriori property which requires a more complex pattern to appear within records only at places where all of its subpatterns are detected as well. The approach is based on a novel data structure called the Extended Vertical List that tracks positions of the first state of the pattern inside records. Extensive computational results indicate that the new method performs significantly faster than the previous version of the algorithm for TMP. However, the speed-up comes at the expense of memory usage. … 

**Fast Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network (Fast-SCNN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The encoder-decoder framework is state-of-the-art for offline semantic image segmentation. Since the rise in autonomous systems, real-time computation is increasingly desirable. In this paper, we introduce fast segmentation convolutional neural network (Fast-SCNN), an above real-time semantic segmentation model on high resolution image data (1024x2048px) suited to efficient computation on embedded devices with low memory. Building on existing two-branch methods for fast segmentation, we introduce our `learning to downsample’ module which computes low-level features for multiple resolution branches simultaneously. Our network combines spatial detail at high resolution with deep features extracted at lower resolution, yielding an accuracy of 68.0% mean intersection over union at 123.5 frames per second on Cityscapes. We also show that large scale pre-training is unnecessary. We thoroughly validate our metric in experiments with ImageNet pre-training and the coarse labeled data of Cityscapes. Finally, we show even faster computation with competitive results on subsampled inputs, without any network modifications. … 

**Quotient Hash Table (QHT)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This article presents the Quotient Hash Table (QHT) a new data structure for duplicate detection in unbounded streams. QHTs stem from a corrected analysis of streaming quotient filters (SQFs), resulting in a 33\% reduction in memory usage for equal performance. We provide a new and thorough analysis of both algorithms, with results of interest to other existing constructions. We also introduce an optimised version of our new data structure dubbed Queued QHT with Duplicates (QQHTD). Finally we discuss the effect of adversarial inputs for hash-based duplicate filters similar to QHT. …
