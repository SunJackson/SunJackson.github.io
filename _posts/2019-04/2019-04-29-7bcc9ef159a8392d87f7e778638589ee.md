**GraphNAS: Graph Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning**

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popularly used for analyzing non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks, GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.

**Distributed Differentially Private Computation of Functions with Correlated Noise**

Many applications of machine learning, such as human health research, involve processing private or sensitive information. Privacy concerns may impose significant hurdles to collaboration in scenarios where there are multiple sites holding data and the goal is to estimate properties jointly across all datasets. Differentially private decentralized algorithms can provide strong privacy guarantees. However, the accuracy of the joint estimates may be poor when the datasets at each site are small. This paper proposes a new framework, Correlation Assisted Private Estimation (CAPE), for designing privacy-preserving decentralized algorithms with better accuracy guarantees in an honest-but-curious model. CAPE can be used in conjunction with the functional mechanism for statistical and machine learning optimization problems. A tighter characterization of the functional mechanism is provided that allows CAPE to achieve the same performance as a centralized algorithm in the decentralized setting using all datasets. Empirical results on regression and neural network problems for both synthetic and real datasets show that differentially private methods can be competitive with non-private algorithms in many scenarios of interest.

**The MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors**

Though deep reinforcement learning has led to breakthroughs in many difficult domains, these successes have required an ever-increasing number of samples. As state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) systems require an exponentially increasing number of samples, their development is restricted to a continually shrinking segment of the AI community. Likewise, many of these systems cannot be applied to real-world problems, where environment samples are expensive. Resolution of these limitations requires new, sample-efficient methods. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce the MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors. The primary goal of the competition is to foster the development of algorithms which can efficiently leverage human demonstrations to drastically reduce the number of samples needed to solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse environments. To that end, we introduce: (1) the Minecraft ObtainDiamond task, a sequential decision making environment requiring long-term planning, hierarchical control, and efficient exploration methods; and (2) the MineRL-v0 dataset, a large-scale collection of over 60 million state-action pairs of human demonstrations that can be resimulated into embodied trajectories with arbitrary modifications to game state and visuals. Participants will compete to develop systems which solve the ObtainDiamond task with a limited number of samples from the environment simulator, Malmo. The competition is structured into two rounds in which competitors are provided several paired versions of the dataset and environment with different game textures. At the end of each round, competitors will submit containerized versions of their learning algorithms and they will then be trained/evaluated from scratch on a hold-out dataset-environment pair for a total of 4-days on a prespecified hardware platform.

**Seasonal FIEGARCH Processes**

Here we develop the theory of seasonal FIEGARCH processes, denoted by SFIEGARCH, establishing conditions for the existence, the invertibility, the stationarity and the ergodicity of these processes. We analyze their asymptotic dependence structure by means of the autocovariance and autocorrelation functions. We also present some properties regarding their spectral representation. All properties are illustrated through graphical examples and an application of SFIEGARCH models to describe the volatility of the S&P500 US stock index log-return time series in the period from December 13, 2004 to October 10, 2009 is provided.

**Semi-Cyclic Stochastic Gradient Descent**

We consider convex SGD updates with a block-cyclic structure, i.e. where each cycle consists of a small number of blocks, each with many samples from a possibly different, block-specific, distribution. This situation arises, e.g., in Federated Learning where the mobile devices available for updates at different times during the day have different characteristics. We show that such block-cyclic structure can significantly deteriorate the performance of SGD, but propose a simple approach that allows prediction with the same performance guarantees as for i.i.d., non-cyclic, sampling.

**Exploring Graph Learning for Semi-Supervised Classification Beyond Euclidean Data**

Semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data has received increasing attention, where labels are only available for a small subset of data such as social networks and citation networks. This problem is challenging due to the irregularity of graphs. Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have been recently proposed to address such kinds of problems, which feed the graph topology into the network to guide operations such as graph convolution. Nevertheless, in most cases where the graphs are not given, they are empirically constructed manually, which tends to be sub-optimal. Hence, we propose Graph Learning Neural Networks (GLNN), which exploits the optimization of graphs (the adjacency matrix in particular) and integrates into the GCN for semi-supervised node classification. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, this essentially combines both graph learning and graph convolution into a unified framework. Specifically, we represent features of social/citation networks as graph signals, and propose the objective of graph learning from the graph-signal prior, sparsity constraint and properties of a valid adjacency matrix via maximum a posteriori estimation. The optimization objective is then integrated into the loss function of the GCN, leading to joint learning of the adjacency matrix and high-level features. Experimental results show that our proposed GLNN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches over widely adopted social network datasets and citation network datasets.

**Analysis and Visualization of Deep Neural Networks in Device-Free Wi-Fi Indoor Localization**

Device-free Wi-Fi indoor localization has received significant attention as a key enabling technology for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Machine learning-based location estimators, such as the deep neural network (DNN), carry proven potential in achieving high-precision localization performance by automatically learning discriminative features from the noisy wireless signal measurements. However, the inner workings of DNNs are not transparent and not adequately understood especially in the indoor localization application. In this paper, we provide quantitative and visual explanations for the DNN learning process as well as the critical features that DNN has learned during the process. Toward this end, we propose to use several visualization techniques, including: 1) dimensionality reduction visualization, to project the high-dimensional feature space to the 2D space to facilitate visualization and interpretation, and 2) visual analytics and information visualization, to quantify relative contributions of each feature with the proposed feature manipulation procedures. The results provide insightful views and plausible explanations of the DNN in device-free Wi-Fi indoor localization using channel state information (CSI) fingerprints.

**Learning Feature Sparse Principal Components**

Sparse PCA has shown its effectiveness in high dimensional data analysis, while there is still a gap between the computational method and statistical theory. This paper presents algorithms to solve the row-sparsity constrained PCA, named Feature Sparse PCA (FSPCA), which performs feature selection and PCA simultaneously. Existing techniques to solve the FSPCA problem suffer two main drawbacks: (1) most approaches only solve the leading eigenvector and rely on the deflation technique to estimate the leading m eigenspace, which has feature sparsity inconsistence, identifiability, and orthogonality issues; (2) some approaches are heuristics without convergence guarantee. In this paper, we present convergence guaranteed algorithms to directly estimate the leading m eigenspace. In detail, we show for a low rank covariance matrix, the FSPCA problem can be solved globally (Algorithm 1). Then, we propose an algorithm (Algorithm 2) to solve the FSPCA for general covariance by iteratively building a carefully designed low rank proxy covariance. Theoretical analysis gives the convergence guarantee. Experimental results show the promising performance of the new algorithms compared with the state-of-the-art method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Multi-Task Learning for Argumentation Mining**

Multi-task learning has recently become a very active field in deep learning research. In contrast to learning a single task in isolation, multiple tasks are learned at the same time, thereby utilizing the training signal of related tasks to improve the performance on the respective machine learning tasks. Related work shows various successes in different domains when applying this paradigm and this thesis extends the existing empirical results by evaluating multi-task learning in four different scenarios: argumentation mining, epistemic segmentation, argumentation component segmentation, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. We show that multi-task learning can, indeed, improve the performance compared to single-task learning in all these scenarios, but may also hurt the performance. Therefore, we investigate the reasons for successful and less successful applications of this paradigm and find that dataset properties such as entropy or the size of the label inventory are good indicators for a potential multi-task learning success and that multi-task learning is particularly useful if the task at hand suffers from data sparsity, i.e. a lack of training data. Moreover, multi-task learning is particularly effective for long input sequences in our experiments. We have observed this trend in all evaluated scenarios. Finally, we develop a highly configurable and extensible sequence tagging framework which supports multi-task learning to conduct our empirical experiments and to aid future research regarding the multi-task learning paradigm and natural language processing.

**Student Becoming the Master: Knowledge Amalgamation for Joint Scene Parsing, Depth Estimation, and More**

In this paper, we investigate a novel deep-model reusing task. Our goal is to train a lightweight and versatile student model, without human-labelled annotations, that amalgamates the knowledge and masters the expertise of two pretrained teacher models working on heterogeneous problems, one on scene parsing and the other on depth estimation. To this end, we propose an innovative training strategy that learns the parameters of the student intertwined with the teachers, achieved by ‘projecting’ its amalgamated features onto each teacher’s domain and computing the loss. We also introduce two options to generalize the proposed training strategy to handle three or more tasks simultaneously. The proposed scheme yields very encouraging results. As demonstrated on several benchmarks, the trained student model achieves results even superior to those of the teachers in their own expertise domains and on par with the state-of-the-art fully supervised models relying on human-labelled annotations.

**Statistical Learning and Estimation of Piano Fingering**

Automatic estimation of piano fingering is important for computationally understanding the process of music performance and applicable to performance assistance and education systems. While a natural way to formulate the quality of fingerings is to construct models of the constraints/costs of performance, it is generally difficult to find appropriate parameter values for these models. Here we study an alternative data-driven approach based on statistical modeling in which the naturalness of a given fingering is described by probabilities. Specifically, we construct two types of hidden Markov models (HMMs) and their higher-order extensions. We also study deep neural network (DNN)-based methods for comparison. Using a newly released dataset of fingering annotations, we conduct systematic evaluations of these models as well as a representative constraint-based method and find that the methods based on high-order HMMs outperform others in terms of estimation accuracies. We also quantitatively study individual difference of fingering and propose evaluation measures that can be used with multiple ground truth data. We conclude that the HMM-based methods are currently state of the art and generate acceptable fingerings in most parts and that they have certain limitations such as ignorance of phrase boundaries and interdependence of the two hands.

**Deep Learning for Survival Outcomes**

This manuscripts develops a new class of deep learning algorithms for outcomes that are potentially censored. To account for censoring, the unobservable loss function used in the absence of censoring is replaced by a censoring unbiased transformation. The resulting class of algorithms can be used to estimate both survival probabilities and restricted mean survival. We show how the deep learning algorithms can be implemented using software for uncensored data using a form of response transformation. Simulations and analysis of the Netherlands 70 Gene Signature Data show strong performance of the proposed algorithms.

**Regression-Enhanced Random Forests**

Random forest (RF) methodology is one of the most popular machine learning techniques for prediction problems. In this article, we discuss some cases where random forests may suffer and propose a novel generalized RF method, namely regression-enhanced random forests (RERFs), that can improve on RFs by borrowing the strength of penalized parametric regression. The algorithm for constructing RERFs and selecting its tuning parameters is described. Both simulation study and real data examples show that RERFs have better predictive performance than RFs in important situations often encountered in practice. Moreover, RERFs may incorporate known relationships between the response and the predictors, and may give reliable predictions in extrapolation problems where predictions are required at points out of the domain of the training dataset. Strategies analogous to those described here can be used to improve other machine learning methods via combination with penalized parametric regression techniques.

**Latent Variable Algorithms for Multimodal Learning and Sensor Fusion**

Multimodal learning has been lacking principled ways of combining information from different modalities and learning a low-dimensional manifold of meaningful representations. We study multimodal learning and sensor fusion from a latent variable perspective. We first present a regularized recurrent attention filter for sensor fusion. This algorithm can dynamically combine information from different types of sensors in a sequential decision making task. Each sensor is bonded with a modular neural network to maximize utility of its own information. A gating modular neural network dynamically generates a set of mixing weights for outputs from sensor networks by balancing utility of all sensors’ information. We design a co-learning mechanism to encourage co-adaption and independent learning of each sensor at the same time, and propose a regularization based co-learning method. In the second part, we focus on recovering the manifold of latent representation. We propose a co-learning approach using probabilistic graphical model which imposes a structural prior on the generative model: multimodal variational RNN (MVRNN) model, and derive a variational lower bound for its objective functions. In the third part, we extend the siamese structure to sensor fusion for robust acoustic event detection. We perform experiments to investigate the latent representations that are extracted; works will be done in the following months. Our experiments show that the recurrent attention filter can dynamically combine different sensor inputs according to the information carried in the inputs. We consider MVRNN can identify latent representations that are useful for many downstream tasks such as speech synthesis, activity recognition, and control and planning. Both algorithms are general frameworks which can be applied to other tasks where different types of sensors are jointly used for decision making.
