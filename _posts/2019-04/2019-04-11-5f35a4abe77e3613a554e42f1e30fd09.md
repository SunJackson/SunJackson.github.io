**SysML: The New Frontier of Machine Learning Systems**

Machine learning (ML) techniques are enjoying rapidly increasing adoption. However, designing and implementing the systems that support ML models in real-world deployments remains a significant obstacle, in large part due to the radically different development and deployment profile of modern ML methods, and the range of practical concerns that come with broader adoption. We propose to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the intersection of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics such as hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for metrics beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference, SysML, that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and machine learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in systems and ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the two.

**Adaptation of Hierarchical Structured Models for Speech Act Recognition in Asynchronous Conversation**

We address the problem of speech act recognition (SAR) in asynchronous conversations (forums, emails). Unlike synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings, phone), asynchronous domains lack large labeled datasets to train an effective SAR model. In this paper, we propose methods to effectively leverage abundant unlabeled conversational data and the available labeled data from synchronous domains. We carry out our research in three main steps. First, we introduce a neural architecture based on hierarchical LSTMs and conditional random fields (CRF) for SAR, and show that our method outperforms existing methods when trained on in-domain data only. Second, we improve our initial SAR models by semi-supervised learning in the form of pretrained word embeddings learned from a large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally, we employ adversarial training to improve the results further by leveraging the labeled data from synchronous domains and by explicitly modeling the distributional shift in two domains.

**A comparative study of physics-informed neural network models for learning unknown dynamics and constitutive relations**

We investigate the use of discrete and continuous versions of physics-informed neural network methods for learning unknown dynamics or constitutive relations of a dynamical system. For the case of unknown dynamics, we represent all the dynamics with a deep neural network (DNN). When the dynamics of the system are known up to the specification of constitutive relations (that can depend on the state of the system), we represent these constitutive relations with a DNN. The discrete versions combine classical multistep discretization methods for dynamical systems with neural network based machine learning methods. On the other hand, the continuous versions utilize deep neural networks to minimize the residual function for the continuous governing equations. We use the case of a fedbatch bioreactor system to study the effectiveness of these approaches and discuss conditions for their applicability. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the trained neural network models is much higher for the cases where we only have to learn a constitutive relation instead of the whole dynamics. This finding corroborates the well-known fact from scientific computing that building as much structural information is available into an algorithm can enhance its efficiency and/or accuracy.

**Black is to Criminal as Caucasian is to Police: Detecting and Removing Multiclass Bias in Word Embeddings**

Online texts — across genres, registers, domains, and styles — are riddled with human stereotypes, expressed in overt or subtle ways. Word embeddings, trained on these texts, perpetuate and amplify these stereotypes, and propagate biases to machine learning models that use word embeddings as features. In this work, we propose a method to debias word embeddings in multiclass settings such as race and religion, extending the work of (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) from the binary setting, such as binary gender. Next, we propose a novel methodology for the evaluation of multiclass debiasing. We demonstrate that our multiclass debiasing is robust and maintains the efficacy in standard NLP tasks.

**Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP: A Report on the First BlackboxNLP Workshop**

The EMNLP 2018 workshop BlackboxNLP was dedicated to resources and techniques specifically developed for analyzing and understanding the inner-workings and representations acquired by neural models of language. Approaches included: systematic manipulation of input to neural networks and investigating the impact on their performance, testing whether interpretable knowledge can be decoded from intermediate representations acquired by neural networks, proposing modifications to neural network architectures to make their knowledge state or generated output more explainable, and examining the performance of networks on simplified or formal languages. Here we review a number of representative studies in each category.

**HOList: An Environment for Machine Learning of Higher-Order Theorem Proving (extended version)**

We present an environment, benchmark, and deep learning driven automated theorem prover for higher-order logic. Higher-order interactive theorem provers enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present an interesting, open-ended challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning. We also present a deep reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, with strong initial results on this benchmark.

**Average Sensitivity of Graph Algorithms**

In modern applications of graphs algorithms, where the graphs of interest are large and dynamic, it is unrealistic to assume that an input representation contains the full information of a graph being studied. Hence, it is desirable to use algorithms that, even when only a (large) subgraph is available, output solutions that are close to the solutions output when the whole graph is available. We formalize this idea by introducing the notion of average sensitivity of graph algorithms, which is the average earth mover’s distance between the output distributions of an algorithm on a graph and its subgraph obtained by removing an edge, where the average is over the edges removed and the distance between two outputs is the Hamming distance. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of average sensitivity. After deriving basic properties of average sensitivity such as composability, we provide efficient approximation algorithms with low average sensitivities for concrete graph problems, including the minimum spanning forest problem, the global minimum cut problem, the maximum matching problem, and the minimum vertex cover problem. We also show that every algorithm for the 2-coloring problem has average sensitivity linear in the number of vertices. To show our algorithmic results, we establish and utilize the following fact; if the presence of a vertex or an edge in the solution output by an algorithm can be decided locally, then the algorithm has a low average sensitivity, allowing us to reuse the analyses of known sublinear-time algorithms.

**Robust Subspace Recovery with Adversarial Outliers**

We study the problem of robust subspace recovery (RSR) in the presence of adversarial outliers. That is, we seek a subspace that contains a large portion of a dataset when some fraction of the data points are arbitrarily corrupted. We first examine a theoretical estimator that is intractable to calculate and use it to derive information-theoretic bounds of exact recovery. We then propose two tractable estimators: a variant of RANSAC and a simple relaxation of the theoretical estimator. The two estimators are fast to compute and achieve state-of-the-art theoretical performance in a noiseless RSR setting with adversarial outliers. The former estimator achieves better theoretical guarantees in the noiseless case, while the latter estimator is robust to small noise, and its guarantees significantly improve with non-adversarial models of outliers. We give a complete comparison of guarantees for the adversarial RSR problem, as well as a short discussion on the estimation of affine subspaces.

**Prediction-Tracking-Segmentation**

We introduce a prediction driven method for visual tracking and segmentation in videos. Instead of solely relying on matching with appearance cues for tracking, we build a predictive model which guides finding more accurate tracking regions efficiently. With the proposed prediction mechanism, we improve the model robustness against distractions and occlusions during tracking. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods not only on visual tracking tasks (VOT 2016 and VOT 2018) but also on video segmentation datasets (DAVIS 2016 and DAVIS 2017).

**A Multi-task Learning Approach for Named Entity Recognition using Local Detection**

Named entity recognition (NER) systems that perform well require task-related and manually annotated datasets. However, they are expensive to develop, and are thus limited in size. As there already exists a large number of NER datasets that share a certain degree of relationship but differ in content, it is important to explore the question of whether such datasets can be combined as a simple method for improving NER performance. To investigate this, we developed a novel locally detecting multitask model using FFNNs. The model relies on encoding variable-length sequences of words into theoretically lossless and unique fixed-size representations. We applied this method to several well-known NER tasks and compared the results of our model to baseline models as well as other published results. As a result, we observed competitive performance in nearly all of the tasks.

**Measuring scheduling efficiency of RNNs for NLP applications**

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown state of the art results for speech recognition, natural language processing, image captioning and video summarizing applications. Many of these applications run on low-power platforms, so their energy efficiency is extremely important. We observed that cache-oblivious RNN scheduling during inference typically results in 30-50x more data transferred on and off the CPU than the application’s working set size. This can potentially impact its energy efficiency. This paper presents a new metric called Data Reuse Efficiency to gauge the RNN scheduling efficiency of a platform and shows the factors that influence the DRE value. Additionally, this paper discusses an optimization to improve reuse in RNNs and highlights the positive impact of this optimization on the total amount of memory read from or written to the memory controller (and, hence, the DRE value) during the execution of an RNN application for a mobile SoC.

**CoUPM: Correlated Utility-based Pattern Mining**

In the field of data mining and analytics, the utility theory from Economic can bring benefits in many real-life applications. In recent decade, a new research field called utility-oriented mining has already attracted great attention. Previous studies have, however, the limitation that they rarely consider the inherent correlation of items among patterns. Consider the purchase behaviors of consumer, a high-utility group of products (w.r.t. multi-products) may contain several very high-utility products with some low-utility products. However, it is considered as a valuable pattern even if this behavior/pattern may be not highly correlated, or even happen by chance. In this paper, in light of these challenges, we propose an efficient utility mining approach namely non-redundant Correlated high-Utility Pattern Miner (CoUPM) by taking positive correlation and profitable value into account. The derived patterns with high utility and strong positive correlation can lead to more insightful availability than those patterns only have high profitable values. The utility-list structure is revised and applied to store necessary information of both correlation and utility. Several pruning strategies are further developed to improve the efficiency for discovering the desired patterns. Experimental results show that the non-redundant correlated high-utility patterns have more effectiveness than some other kinds of interesting patterns. Moreover, efficiency of the proposed CoUPM algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm.

**ReMASC: Realistic Replay Attack Corpus for Voice Controlled Systems**

This paper introduces a new database of voice recordings with the goal of supporting research on vulnerabilities and protection of voice-controlled systems (VCSs). In contrast to prior efforts, the proposed database contains both genuine voice commands and replayed recordings of such commands, collected in realistic VCSs usage scenarios and using modern voice assistant development kits. Specifically, the database contains recordings from four systems (each with a different microphone array) in a variety of environmental conditions with different forms of background noise and relative positions between speaker and device. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available database that has been specifically designed for the protection of state-of-the-art voice-controlled systems against various replay attacks in various conditions and environments.

**Reinforcement Learning with Attention that Works: A Self-Supervised Approach**

Attention models have had a significant positive impact on deep learning across a range of tasks. However previous attempts at integrating attention with reinforcement learning have failed to produce significant improvements. We propose the first combination of self attention and reinforcement learning that is capable of producing significant improvements, including new state of the art results in the Arcade Learning Environment. Unlike the selective attention models used in previous attempts, which constrain the attention via preconceived notions of importance, our implementation utilises the Markovian properties inherent in the state input. Our method produces a faithful visualisation of the policy, focusing on the behaviour of the agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the trained policies use multiple simultaneous foci of attention, and are able to modulate attention over time to deal with situations of partial observability.

**A Novel Continuous Representation of Genetic Programmings using Recurrent Neural Networks for Symbolic Regression**

Neuro-encoded expression programming that aims to offer a novel continuous representation of combinatorial encoding for genetic programming methods is proposed in this paper. Genetic programming with linear representation uses nature-inspired operators to tune expressions and finally search out the best explicit function to simulate data. The encoding mechanism is essential for genetic programmings to find a desirable solution efficiently. However, the linear representation methods manipulate the expression tree in discrete solution space, where a small change of the input can cause a large change of the output. The unsmooth landscapes destroy the local information and make difficulty in searching. The neuro-encoded expression programming constructs the gene string with recurrent neural network (RNN) and the weights of the network are optimized by powerful continuous evolutionary algorithms. The neural network mappings smoothen the sharp fitness landscape and provide rich neighborhood information to find the best expression. The experiments indicate that the novel approach improves test accuracy and efficiency on several well-known symbolic regression problems.

**Modeling Point Clouds with Self-Attention and Gumbel Subset Sampling**

Geometric deep learning is increasingly important thanks to the popularity of 3D sensors. Inspired by the recent advances in NLP domain, the self-attention transformer is introduced to consume the point clouds. We develop Point Attention Transformers (PATs), using a parameter-efficient Group Shuffle Attention (GSA) to replace the costly Multi-Head Attention. We demonstrate its ability to process size-varying inputs, and prove its permutation equivariance. Besides, prior work uses heuristics dependence on the input data (e.g., Furthest Point Sampling) to hierarchically select subsets of input points. Thereby, we for the first time propose an end-to-end learnable and task-agnostic sampling operation, named Gumbel Subset Sampling (GSS), to select a representative subset of input points. Equipped with Gumbel-Softmax, it produces a ‘soft’ continuous subset in training phase, and a ‘hard’ discrete subset in test phase. By selecting representative subsets in a hierarchical fashion, the networks learn a stronger representation of the input sets with lower computation cost. Experiments on classification and segmentation benchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel application, to process event camera stream as point clouds, and achieve a state-of-the-art performance on DVS128 Gesture Dataset.

**Effective and Efficient Dropout for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks**

Machine-learning-based data-driven applications have become ubiquitous, e.g., health-care analysis and database system optimization. Big training data and large (deep) models are crucial for good performance. Dropout has been widely used as an efficient regularization technique to prevent large models from overfitting. However, many recent works show that dropout does not bring much performance improvement for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning model for data-driven applications. In this paper, we formulate existing dropout methods for CNNs under the same analysis framework to investigate the failures. We attribute the failure to the conflicts between the dropout and the batch normalization operation after it. Consequently, we propose to change the order of the operations, which results in new building blocks of CNNs.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR, SVHN and ImageNet have been conducted to compare the existing building blocks and our new building blocks with different dropout methods. The results confirm the superiority of our proposed building blocks due to the regularization and implicit model ensemble effect of dropout. In particular, we improve over state-of-the-art CNNs with significantly better performance of 3.17%, 16.15%, 1.44%, 21.46% error rate on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and ImageNet respectively.

**Step-by-Step: Separating Planning from Realization in Neural Data-to-Text Generation**

Data-to-text generation can be conceptually divided into two parts: ordering and structuring the information (planning), and generating fluent language describing the information (realization). Modern neural generation systems conflate these two steps into a single end-to-end differentiable system. We propose to split the generation process into a symbolic text-planning stage that is faithful to the input, followed by a neural generation stage that focuses only on realization. For training a plan-to-text generator, we present a method for matching reference texts to their corresponding text plans. For inference time, we describe a method for selecting high-quality text plans for new inputs. We implement and evaluate our approach on the WebNLG benchmark. Our results demonstrate that decoupling text planning from neural realization indeed improves the system’s reliability and adequacy while maintaining fluent output. We observe improvements both in BLEU scores and in manual evaluations. Another benefit of our approach is the ability to output diverse realizations of the same input, paving the way to explicit control over the generated text structure.

**Parallelizable Stack Long Short-Term Memory**

Stack Long Short-Term Memory (StackLSTM) is useful for various applications such as parsing and string-to-tree neural machine translation, but it is also known to be notoriously difficult to parallelize for GPU training due to the fact that the computations are dependent on discrete operations. In this paper, we tackle this problem by utilizing state access patterns of StackLSTM to homogenize computations with regard to different discrete operations. Our parsing experiments show that the method scales up almost linearly with increasing batch size, and our parallelized PyTorch implementation trains significantly faster compared to the Dynet C++ implementation.

**Incremental embedding for temporal networks**

Prediction over edges and nodes in graphs requires appropriate and efficiently achieved data representation. Recent research on representation learning for dynamic networks resulted in a significant progress. However, the more precise and accurate methods, the greater computational and memory complexity. Here, we introduce ICMEN – the first-in-class incremental meta-embedding method that produces vector representations of nodes respecting temporal dependencies in the graph. ICMEN efficiently constructs nodes’ embedding from historical representations by linearly convex combinations making the process less memory demanding than state-of-the-art embedding algorithms. The method is capable of constructing representation for inactive and new nodes without a need to re-embed. The results of link prediction on several real-world datasets shown that applying ICMEN incremental meta-method to any base embedding approach, we receive similar results and save memory and computational power. Taken together, our work proposes a new way of efficient online representation learning in dynamic complex networks.

**Unsupervised Embedding Learning via Invariant and Spreading Instance Feature**

This paper studies the unsupervised embedding learning problem, which requires an effective similarity measurement between samples in low-dimensional embedding space. Motivated by the positive concentrated and negative separated properties observed from category-wise supervised learning, we propose to utilize the instance-wise supervision to approximate these properties, which aims at learning data augmentation invariant and instance spread-out features. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel instance based softmax embedding method, which directly optimizes the `real’ instance features on top of the softmax function. It achieves significantly faster learning speed and higher accuracy than all existing methods. The proposed method performs well for both seen and unseen testing categories with cosine similarity. It also achieves competitive performance even without pre-trained network over samples from fine-grained categories.

**Iterative Normalization: Beyond Standardization towards Efficient Whitening**

Batch Normalization (BN) is ubiquitously employed for accelerating neural network training and improving the generalization capability by performing standardization within mini-batches. Decorrelated Batch Normalization (DBN) further boosts the above effectiveness by whitening. However, DBN relies heavily on either a large batch size, or eigen-decomposition that suffers from poor efficiency on GPUs. We propose Iterative Normalization (IterNorm), which employs Newton’s iterations for much more efficient whitening, while simultaneously avoiding the eigen-decomposition. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive study to show IterNorm has better trade-off between optimization and generalization, with theoretical and experimental support. To this end, we exclusively introduce Stochastic Normalization Disturbance (SND), which measures the inherent stochastic uncertainty of samples when applied to normalization operations. With the support of SND, we provide natural explanations to several phenomena from the perspective of optimization, e.g., why group-wise whitening of DBN generally outperforms full-whitening and why the accuracy of BN degenerates with reduced batch sizes. We demonstrate the consistently improved performance of IterNorm with extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over BN and DBN.

**TULIP: A Toolbox for Linear Discriminant Analysis with Penalties**

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a powerful tool in building classifiers with easy computation and interpretation. Recent advancements in science technology have led to the popularity of datasets with high dimensions, high orders and complicated structure. Such datasetes motivate the generalization of LDA in various research directions. The R package TULIP integrates several popular high-dimensional LDA-based methods and provides a comprehensive and user-friendly toolbox for linear, semi-parametric and tensor-variate classification. Functions are included for model fitting, cross validation and prediction. In addition, motivated by datasets with diverse sources of predictors, we further include functions for covariate adjustment. Our package is carefully tailored for low storage and high computation efficiency. Moreover, our package is the first R package for many of these methods, providing great convenience to researchers in this area.
