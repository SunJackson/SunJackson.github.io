**Multimodal Intelligent inteRactIon for Autonomous systeMs (MIRIAM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present MIRIAM (Multimodal Intelligent inteRactIon for Autonomous systeMs), a multimodal interface to support situation awareness of autonomous vehicles through chat-based interaction. The user is able to chat about the vehicle’s plan, objectives, previous activities and mission progress. The system is mixed initiative in that it pro-actively sends messages about key events, such as fault warnings. We will demonstrate MIRIAM using SeeByte’s SeeTrack command and control interface and Neptune autonomy simulator. … 

**LectureBank** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recent years have witnessed the rising popularity of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Many online courses and resources are available even for those without a strong background in the field. Often the student is curious about a specific topic but does not quite know where to begin studying. To answer the question of ‘what should one learn first,’ we apply an embedding-based method to learn prerequisite relations for course concepts in the domain of NLP. We introduce LectureBank, a dataset containing 1,352 English lecture files collected from university courses which are each classified according to an existing taxonomy as well as 208 manually-labeled prerequisite relation topics, which is publicly available. The dataset will be useful for educational purposes such as lecture preparation and organization as well as applications such as reading list generation. Additionally, we experiment with neural graph-based networks and non-neural classifiers to learn these prerequisite relations from our dataset. … 

**Data-Dependent Upsampling (DUpsampling)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recent semantic segmentation methods exploit encoder-decoder architectures to produce the desired pixel-wise segmentation prediction. The last layer of the decoders is typically a bilinear upsampling procedure to recover the final pixel-wise prediction. We empirically show that this oversimple and data-independent bilinear upsampling may lead to sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a data-dependent upsampling (DUpsampling) to replace bilinear, which takes advantages of the redundancy in the label space of semantic segmentation and is able to recover the pixel-wise prediction from low-resolution outputs of CNNs. The main advantage of the new upsampling layer lies in that with a relatively lower-resolution feature map such as $\frac{1}{16}$ or $\frac{1}{32}$ of the input size, we can achieve even better segmentation accuracy, significantly reducing computation complexity. This is made possible by 1) the new upsampling layer’s much improved reconstruction capability; and more importantly 2) the DUpsampling based decoder’s flexibility in leveraging almost arbitrary combinations of the CNN encoders’ features. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed decoder outperforms the state-of-the-art decoder, with only $\sim$20\% of computation. Finally, without any post-processing, the framework equipped with our proposed decoder achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two datasets: 88.1\% mIOU on PASCAL VOC with 30\% computation of the previously best model; and 52.5\% mIOU on PASCAL Context. …
