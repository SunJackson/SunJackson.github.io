##### 

#### **21. Explain Elastic Block Storage? What Type of Performance can you Expect? How do you Back it****Up? How do you Improve Performance?**

That indicates it is RAID warehouse to begin with, so it’s irrelevant and faults tolerant. If disks expire in the RAID you don’t miss data. Excellent! It is more virtualized, therefore you can provision and designate warehouse, and connect it to your server with multiple API appeals. No calling the storage specialist and asking him or her to operate specific requests from the hardware vendor.

Execution of EBS can manifest variability. Such signifies that can run above the SLA enforcement level, suddenly descend under it. The SLA gives you among a medium disk I/O speed you can foresee. That can prevent any groups particularly performance specialists who suspect stable and compatible disk throughput on a server. Common physically entertained servers perform that direction. Pragmatic AWS cases do not.

Backup EBS masses by utilizing the snap convenience through API proposal or by a GUI interface same elasticfox.

Progress execution by practising Linux software invasion and striping over four extents.

After an EBS volume is attached to an instance, you can use it like any other physical hard drive. Amazon EBS encryption feature supports encryption feature.


- Amazon EC2 Instance Store: Storage disk that is attached to the host computer is referred to as instance store. The instance storage provides temporary block-level storage for Amazon EC2 instances. The data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated Amazon EC2 instance; if you stop or terminate an instance, any data on instance store volumes is lost.


- Amazon S3: Amazon S3 provides access to reliable and inexpensive data storage infrastructure. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier by enabling you to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from within Amazon EC2 or anywhere on the web.


- Adding Storage: Every time you launch an instance from an AMI, a root storage device is created for that instance. The root storage device contains all the information necessary to boot the instance. You can specify storage volumes in addition to the root device volume when you create an AMI or launch an instance using block device mapping.


##### 

#### **32. What are the Security Best Practices for Amazon Ec2?**

- There are several best practices for secure Amazon EC2. Following are a few of them.

- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (AM) to control access to your AWS resources.

- Restrict access by only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on your instance.

- Review the rules in your security groups regularly, and ensure that you apply the principle of least

- Privilege — only open up permissions that you require.

- Disable password-based logins for instances launched from your AMI. Passwords can be found or cracked, and are a security risk.


##### 

#### **33. Explain Stopping, Starting, and Terminating an Amazon Ec2 Instance?**

**Stopping and Starting an instance:** When an instance is stopped, the instance performs a normal shutdown and then transitions to a stopped state. All of its Amazon EBS volumes remain attached, and you can start the instance again at a later time. You are not charged for additional instance hours while the instance is in a stopped state.

**Terminating an instance:** When an instance is terminated, the instance performs a normal shutdown, then the attached Amazon EBS volumes are deleted unless the volume’s deleteOnTermination attribute is set to false. The instance itself is also deleted, and you can’t start the instance again at a later time.

##### 

#### **34. What is S3? What is it used for? Should Encryption be Used?**

S3 implies for Simple Storage Service. You can believe it similar ftp warehouse, wherever you can transfer records to and from beyond, merely not uprise it similar to a filesystem. AWS automatically places your snaps there, at the same time AMIs there. sensitive data is treated with Encryption, as S3 is an exclusive technology promoted by Amazon themselves, and as still unproven vis-a-vis a protection viewpoint.
