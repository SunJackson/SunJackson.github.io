***Data scientists continue to be an elusive hire for organizations across industries. Here’s how automated machine learning can help organizations beat the data skills shortage and drive business growth.***

As digital technologies continue to generate ever-larger quantities of data, organizations face the challenge of unleashing the value of that data. Consider this: our current daily data output is roughly 2.5 quintillion bytes or 2.5 exabytes per day which can be compared to half of all the words ever spoken by mankind!

No wonder then that the demand for data scientists is at an all-time high. According to a recent LinkedIn report, in the U.S. alone, organizations are facing a massive shortage of data scientists with over 151,000 data scientist jobs going unfilled. The acute skills gap and a longer time-to-fill are costing businesses serious money and hindering data analytics deployment.

At a time when technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become crucial to business success, the value of data analytics has never been greater.

“The race is on now to upskill talent. For a long time, we talked about the need to become data-driven to seize a competitive advantage. Now organizations compete in an algorithm economy. Market leading organizations are already exploiting the current AI knowledge gap as a game-changing competency. Today we see simple AI tools in the market but there remains a significant knowledge gap in understanding AI use cases, properly preparing data for machine learning, and using this technology responsibly. The technical barriers were reduced but educational ones were not. To deliver sustainable, ethical, trustworthy AI to the enterprise, organizations do need an AI strategy that addresses prioritized use cases, technical architecture considerations, and ethical standards and reviews,” says Jen Underwood, Senior Director at DataRobot, an automated machine learning platform for businesses.

## **How Can Companies Overcome the Data Scientist Shortage?**

To overcome this problem, organizations are turning to automated machine learning (AutoML) to empower non-data scientists to build more accurate predictive models and free up scarce data science talent to focus on more business-critical initiatives.

AutoML turns the traditional approach to machine learning and data science on its head. It empowers non-data scientists to understand data and achieve business goals. AutoML builds and uses machine learning models in the real world by running systematic process on raw data and selecting models that pull the most relevant information from the data. It also incorporates machine learning best practices to make data science more accessible across the organization.

“Automated machine learning does not replace data scientists,” says Jen. “It scales delivery of AI to more data savvy talent in an organization. Data scientist time is a precious, expensive commodity. An executive from a top global retailer said it best: ‘Companies don't need their data science teams to be good at data science theory; they need them to be ‘ruthlessly practical at delivering value.’

“By automating the time-consuming and repetitive tasks, data scientists can spend far more time solving problems and also delivering more value to the business. The ‘automation-first’ philosophy improves job satisfaction and retention of your top talent, while empowering citizen data scientists to easily get started with data science projects.”

Automated machine learning makes it possible for organizations across industries to unlock the power of machine learning and AI that was previously limited to organizations with massive resources.

## **Data Requirements for Deploying Automated Machine Learning**

Coming to the most important question – what are the data requirements for deploying an automated machine learning platform within an organization?

“Unlike third-normal form transactional or dimensional patterns used in business intelligence, machine learning requires data input as a ‘flattened’ table, view, or comma separated (.csv) flat file of rows and columns. Your view will need to contain an outcome metric, target variable, along with input predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms assume that each record is independent and are not related to other records,” says Jen. “Prepared data should be collected at a level of analytical granularity that you can make decisions upon. Choose a granularity that is actionable, understandable, and useful in the event you incorporated the results into your existing business process or application. For example, if you wanted to make daily sales forecasts, you would need to input data at a day level versus week, month or year.”

Most organizations already capture and store such data. And using a platform like DataRobot, organizations can make aggressive use of data science automation to empower and leverage their most in-demand talent.

## **What Does This Mean for HR?**

Clearly, the demand for data scientists isn’t going reduce anytime soon, however, by deploying an AutoML platform, HR can save valuable time trying to fill entry-level data science positions and better utilize existing data science talent within organizations. In addition to this, as AI becomes an integral part of HR, AutoML can empower the HR function to become more independent and data-driven.
