“Distinguishing between feature selection and dimensionality reduction might seem counter-intuitive at first, since feature selection will eventually lead (reduce dimensionality) to a smaller feature space. In practice, the key difference between the terms “feature selection” and “dimensionality reduction” is that in feature selection, we keep the “original feature axis”, whereas dimensionality reduction usually involves a transformation technique.” Sebastian Raschka ( August 24, 2014 )
