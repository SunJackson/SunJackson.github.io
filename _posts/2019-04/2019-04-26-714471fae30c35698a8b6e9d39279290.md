While it is not one of the popular programming languages for data science, The Go Programming Language (aka Golang) has surfaced for me a few times in the past few years as an option for data science. I decided to do some searching and find some conclusions about whether golang is a good choice for data science. 

## Popularity of Go and Data Science

As the following figure from Google Trends demonstrates, golang and data science became trendy topics at about the same time and grew at a similar rate.

The timely trends may have created the desire to merge the two technologies together. 

## Golang Projects for Data Science

Some internet searching will reveal a number of interesting Golang/Data Science projects on Github. Unfortunately, many of the projects had good initial traction but have dwindled in activity over the last couple years. Below is a listing of some of the data science related projects for Golang.
- Gopher Data – Gophers doing data analysis, no schedule events, last blog post was 2017
- Gopher Notes – Golang in Jupyter Notebooks
- Lgo – Interactive programming with Jupyter for Golang
- Gota – Data frames for Go, “The API is still in flux so *use at your own risk*.”
- qframe – Immutable data frames for Go, better speed than Gota but not as well documented
- GoLearn – Machine Learning for Go
- Gorgonia – Library for machine learning in Go
- Go Sklearn – Port of sci-kit learn from Python, still active but only a couple committers, early but promising 
- Gonum – Numerical library for Go, very promising and active

## Golang Data Science Books

There have even been a couple books written about the topic.

## Thoughts from the Community

The *“Go for Data Science”* debate has been discussed numerous times over the past few years. Below is a listing of some of those discussions and the key take aways.

## Reasons to use Golang for Data Science
- Performance
- Concurrency
- Strong Developer Ecosystem
- Basic Data Science packages are available

## Reasons Not to use Golang for Data Science
- Limited support from the data science community for Golang
- Significantly increased time for exploratory analysis
- Less flexibility to try other optimization and ML techniques
- The data science community has not really adopted golang

In short, Golang is not widely used for exploratory data science, but rewriting your algorithms in Golang might be a good idea.
