Everyone that authors an R package is curious about **how many users** download it. As far as I know there’s still no way to get information on *all* the downloads, from *all* the R mirrors. Here I’m using package **cranlogs**, which only gives information on the downloads from the **R Studio mirror**. It also does not allow to now from where in the world these downloads were made. However, it has a major advantage: speed! The package **cranlogs** provides a easy (and *way* faster) method to get this information **without having to download all the log files** (which can take a long time).

I have written **this little script**, which I use to keep track of my packages’ downloads (here I’m using MetaLandSim as an example).

First of all let’s **load all the required R packages**:

```
#install.packages("cranlogs")
library(cranlogs)
library(ggplot2)
```

If we want to know about**last week’s** downloads:

```
#Last week's downloads
cran_downloads(packages="MetaLandSim", when="last-week")
```

```
## date count package
## 1 2019-03-30 7 MetaLandSim
## 2 2019-03-31 7 MetaLandSim
## 3 2019-04-01 11 MetaLandSim
## 4 2019-04-02 30 MetaLandSim
## 5 2019-04-03 30 MetaLandSim
## 6 2019-04-04 19 MetaLandSim
## 7 2019-04-05 11 MetaLandSim
```

Or about the **overall downloads** (the last date has to be the previous day):

```
#How many overall downloads
mls <- cran_downloads(packages="MetaLandSim", from = "2014-11-09", to = Sys.Date()-1)

sum(mls[,2])
```

So… the **number of downloads** MetaLandSim has is…

```
## [1] 21868
```

 

We can now **plot** the resulting graph, depicting the **daily downloads**:

```
#Plot
gr0 <- ggplot(mls2, aes(mls2$date, mls2$count)) + 
geom_line(colour = "red",size=1) 
gr0 + xlab("Time") + ylab("Nr. of downloads") + 
labs(title = paste0("MetaLandSim daily downloads ", Sys.Date()-1)) 
```

Or we can plot the **cumulative downloads sum** to get an idea about the **rate of increase in download numbers**:

```
#Cumulative
cumulative <- cumsum(mls[,2])
mls2 <- cbind(mls,cumulative)


#Plot
gr1 <- ggplot(mls2, aes(mls2$date, mls2$cumulative)) + 
geom_line(colour = "blue",size=1) 
gr1 + xlab("Time") + ylab("Nr. of downloads") + 
labs(title = paste0("MetaLandSim cumulative downloads until ", Sys.Date()-1)) 
```
