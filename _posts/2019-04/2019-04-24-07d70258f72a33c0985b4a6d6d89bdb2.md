conditionz is a new (just on CRAN today) R package for controlling how many times conditions are thrown.

This package arises from an annoyance in another set of packages I maintain: The brranching package usesthe taxize package internally, calling it’s function `taxize::tax_name()`. The `taxize::tax_name()` functionthrows useful messages to the user if their API key is not found, and gives them instructionson how to find it. However, the user does not have to get an API key. If they don’t they then get subjected tolots of repeats of the same message.

I wondered if there’s anything that could be done about this. That is, if the same message is going to bethrown that was already thrown within a function call, just skip additional messages that are the same.(The tibble package has something like this, but as part of the package itself AFAICT)

The package has the following API:

- `ConditionKeeper`

- `handle_conditions()`

- `handle_messages()`

- `handle_warnings()`


Exported but mostly meant for internal use:

- `capture_message()`

- `capture_warning()`

Installation
Install from CRAN

```
install.packages("conditionz")

```

Development version

```
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/conditionz")

```

Load conditionz

```
library(conditionz)

```


ConditionKeeper
`ConditionKeeper` is an R6 class that keeps track of conditions and letsus determine if conditions have been encountered, how many times they’vebeen encountered, etc.

```
x <- ConditionKeeper$new(times = 4)
x
#> ConditionKeeper
#> id: ea812b48-5137-4d1b-827a-ae79f59f0ad2
#> times: 4
#> messages: 0
x$get_id()
#> [1] "ea812b48-5137-4d1b-827a-ae79f59f0ad2"
x$add("one")
x$add("two")
x
#> ConditionKeeper
#> id: ea812b48-5137-4d1b-827a-ae79f59f0ad2
#> times: 4
#> messages: 2
#> one two
x$thrown_already("one")
#> [1] TRUE
x$thrown_already("bears")
#> [1] FALSE
x$not_thrown_yet("bears")
#> [1] TRUE

x$add("two")
x$add("two")
x$thrown_times("two")
#> [1] 4
x$thrown_enough("two")
#> [1] TRUE
x$thrown_enough("one")
#> [1] FALSE

```

### ConditionKeeper Usage

A simple function that throws messages

```
squared <- function(x) {
 stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
 y <- x^2
 if (y > 20) message("woops, > than 20! check your numbers")
 return(y)
}
foo <- function(x) {
 vapply(x, function(z) squared(z), numeric(1))
}
bar <- function(x, times = 1) {
 y <- ConditionKeeper$new(times = times)
 on.exit(y$purge())
 vapply(x, function(z) y$handle_conditions(squared(z)), numeric(1))
}

```

Running the function normally throws many messages

```
foo(1:10)
#> woops, > than 20! check your numbers
#> woops, > than 20! check your numbers
#> [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100

```

Using in `ConditionKeeper` allows you to control how many messagesare thrown

```
bar(x = 1:10)
#> woops, > than 20! check your numbers
#> [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100

```

```
bar(1:10, times = 3)
#> 
#> woops, > than 20! check your numbers
#> [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100

```


handle_conditions
The function `handle_conditions`/`handle_warnings`/`handle_messages` use`ConditionKeeper` internally, and are meant as a simpler, but less flexiblealternative.

For now, `handle_conditions`/`handle_warnings`/`handle_messages` only allowthrowing the condition 1 time with the `times` parameter. I hope to fix thisso you can choose any number you like.

A small example. Here a function that prints a message with every part of theinput vector.

```
foo <- function(x) {
 for (i in x) message("you gave: ", i)
 return(x)
}

```

If we call that function with the vector `1:5` we get five messages

```
foo(1:5)
#> you gave: 1
#> you gave: 2
#> you gave: 3
#> you gave: 4
#> you gave: 5
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5

```

If we wrap the `foo()` function call in handle_conditions we get onlyone message thrown

```
handle_conditions(foo(1:5))
#> you gave: 1
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5

```

The default for the `condition` parameter is “message”, and calling `handle_messages`does the same thing

```
handle_messages(foo(1:5))
#> you gave: 1
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5

```

For warnings, call `handle_warnings()` or set `handle_conditions(..., condition = "warning")`


To do

- I’m expecting use cases that I haven’t accounted for, the so-called unknown unknowns
- The `handle_conditions`/`handle_warnings`/`handle_messages` need some work to be ableto actually have `times` parameter work as advertised
- I’ll use this package in the brranching package soon, so it will get a real worldtest
