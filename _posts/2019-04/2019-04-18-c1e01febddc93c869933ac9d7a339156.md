**Knowledge Discovery on Blockchains: Challenges and Opportunities**

We study the applicability of blockchain technology for distributed event detection under resource constraints. Therefore we provide a test-suite with several promising consensus methods (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Distributed Proof-of-Work, and Practical Proof-of-Kernel-Work). This is the first work analyzing the communication costs of blockchain consensus methods for knowledge discovery tasks in resource constraint devices. The experiments reveal that our proposed implementations of Distributed Proof-of-Work and Practical Proof-of-Kernel-Work provide a benefit over Proof-of-Work in CPU usage and communication costs. The tests show further that in cases of low data rates, where latencies by mining do not cause harm proposed blockchain implementations could be integrated. However, usage of blockchain requires data broadcasts, which leads to communication overhead as well as memory requirements based on the address list.

**Towards Accurate One-Stage Object Detection with AP-Loss**

One-stage object detectors are trained by optimizing classification-loss and localization-loss simultaneously, with the former suffering much from extreme foreground-background class imbalance issue due to the large number of anchors. This paper alleviates this issue by proposing a novel framework to replace the classification task in one-stage detectors with a ranking task, and adopting the Average-Precision loss (AP-loss) for the ranking problem. Due to its non-differentiability and non-convexity, the AP-loss cannot be optimized directly. For this purpose, we develop a novel optimization algorithm, which seamlessly combines the error-driven update scheme in perceptron learning and backpropagation algorithm in deep networks. We verify good convergence property of the proposed algorithm theoretically and empirically. Experimental results demonstrate notable performance improvement in state-of-the-art one-stage detectors based on AP-loss over different kinds of classification-losses on various benchmarks, without changing the network architectures.

**Patch redundancy in images: a statistical testing framework and some applications**

In this work we introduce a statistical framework in order to analyze the spatial redundancy in natural images. This notion of spatial redundancy must be defined locally and thus we give some examples of functions (auto-similarity and template similarity) which, given one or two images, computes a similarity measurement between patches. Two patches are said to be similar if the similarity measurement is small enough. To derive a criterion for taking a decision on the similarity between two patches we present an a contrario model. Namely, two patches are said to be similar if the associated similarity measurement is unlikely to happen in a background model. Choosing Gaussian random fields as background models we derive non-asymptotic expressions for the probability distribution function of similarity measurements. We introduce a fast algorithm in order to assess redundancy in natural images and present applications in denoising, periodicity analysis and texture ranking.

**Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using Functional Data Analysis**

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an equipment or one of its components is defined as the time left until the equipment or component reaches its end of useful life. Accurate RUL estimation is exceptionally beneficial to Predictive Maintenance, and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Data driven approaches which leverage the power of algorithms for RUL estimation using sensor and operational time series data are gaining popularity. Existing algorithms, such as linear regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), have their own limitations for the RUL estimation task. In this work, we propose a novel Functional Data Analysis (FDA) method called functional Multilayer Perceptron (functional MLP) for RUL estimation. Functional MLP treats time series data from multiple equipment as a sample of random continuous processes over time. FDA explicitly incorporates both the correlations within the same equipment and the random variations across different equipment’s sensor time series into the model. FDA also has the benefit of allowing the relationship between RUL and sensor variables to vary over time. We implement functional MLP on the benchmark NASA C-MAPSS data and evaluate the performance using two popularly-used metrics. Results show the superiority of our algorithm over all the other state-of-the-art methods.

**Temporal Network Representation Learning**

Networks evolve continuously over time with the addition, deletion, and changing of links and nodes. Such temporal networks (or edge streams) consist of a sequence of timestamped edges and are seemingly ubiquitous. Despite the importance of accurately modeling the temporal information, most embedding methods ignore it entirely or approximate the temporal network using a sequence of static snapshot graphs. In this work, we introduce the notion of \emph{temporal walks} for learning dynamic embeddings from temporal networks. Temporal walks capture the temporally valid interactions (\eg, flow of information, spread of disease) in the dynamic network in a lossless fashion. Based on the notion of temporal walks, we describe a general class of embeddings called continuous-time dynamic network embeddings (CTDNEs) that completely avoid the issues and problems that arise when approximating the temporal network as a sequence of static snapshot graphs. Unlike previous work, CTDNEs learn dynamic node embeddings directly from the temporal network at the finest temporal granularity and thus use only temporally valid information. As such CTDNEs naturally support online learning of the node embeddings in a streaming real-time fashion. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this class of embedding methods for prediction in temporal networks.

**A Repository of Conversational Datasets**

Progress in Machine Learning is often driven by the availability of large datasets, and consistent evaluation metrics for comparing modeling approaches. To this end, we present a repository of conversational datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of examples, and a standardised evaluation procedure for conversational response selection models using ‘1-of-100 accuracy’. The repository contains scripts that allow researchers to reproduce the standard datasets, or to adapt the pre-processing and data filtering steps to their needs. We introduce and evaluate several competitive baselines for conversational response selection, whose implementations are shared in the repository, as well as a neural encoder model that is trained on the entire training set.

**Topic Grouper: An Agglomerative Clustering Approach to Topic Modeling**

We introduce Topic Grouper as a complementary approach in the field of probabilistic topic modeling. Topic Grouper creates a disjunctive partitioning of the training vocabulary in a stepwise manner such that resulting partitions represent topics. It is governed by a simple generative model, where the likelihood to generate the training documents via topics is optimized. The algorithm starts with one-word topics and joins two topics at every step. It therefore generates a solution for every desired number of topics ranging between the size of the training vocabulary and one. The process represents an agglomerative clustering that corresponds to a binary tree of topics. A resulting tree may act as a containment hierarchy, typically with more general topics towards the root of tree and more specific topics towards the leaves. Topic Grouper is not governed by a background distribution such as the Dirichlet and avoids hyper parameter optimizations. We show that Topic Grouper has reasonable predictive power and also a reasonable theoretical and practical complexity. Topic Grouper can deal well with stop words and function words and tends to push them into their own topics. Also, it can handle topic distributions, where some topics are more frequent than others. We present typical examples of computed topics from evaluation datasets, where topics appear conclusive and coherent. In this context, the fact that each word belongs to exactly one topic is not a major limitation; in some scenarios this can even be a genuine advantage, e.g.~a related shopping basket analysis may aid in optimizing groupings of articles in sales catalogs.

**Semantic Data Warehouse Modelling for Trajectories**

The trajectory patterns of a moving object in a spatio-temporal domain offers varied information in terms of the management of the data generated from the movement. A trajectory data warehouse is a data repository for the data and information of trajectory objects and their associated spatial objects for defined temporal periods. The query results of trajectory objects from the data warehouse are usually not enough to answer certain trend behaviours and meaningful inferences without the associated semantic information of the trajectory object or the geospatial environment within a specified purpose or context. This paper formulates and designs a generic ontology modelling framework that serves as the background model platform for the design of a semantic data warehouse for trajectories. This semantic trajectory data warehouse can be adaptable for trajectory data processing and analytics on any chosen spatio-temporal application domain. The methodology underpins on higher granularity of data as a result of pre-processed and transformed ETL data so as to offer efficient semantic inference to the underlying trajectory data. Moreover, the approach outlines the thematic dimensions that serve as necessary entities for extracting semantic information. Additionally, the modelling approach offers a design platform for effective predictive trend analysis and knowledge discovery in the trajectory dynamics and data processing for moving objects.

**Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation via Minimax Entropy**

Contemporary domain adaptation methods are very effective at aligning feature distributions of source and target domains without any target supervision. However, we show that these techniques perform poorly when even a few labeled examples are available in the target. To address this semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) setting, we propose a novel Minimax Entropy (MME) approach that adversarially optimizes an adaptive few-shot model. Our base model consists of a feature encoding network, followed by a classification layer that computes the features’ similarity to estimated prototypes (representatives of each class). Adaptation is achieved by alternately maximizing the conditional entropy of unlabeled target data with respect to the classifier and minimizing it with respect to the feature encoder. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method over many baselines, including conventional feature alignment and few-shot methods, setting a new state of the art for SSDA.

**Graph-Embedded Multi-layer Kernel Extreme Learning Machine for One-class Classification or (Graph-Embedded Multi-layer Kernel Ridge Regression for One-class Classification)**

A brain can detect outlier just by using only normal samples. Similarly, one-class classification (OCC) also uses only normal samples to train the model and trained model can be used for outlier detection. In this paper, a multi-layer architecture for OCC is proposed by stacking various Graph-Embedded Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) based Auto-Encoders in a hierarchical fashion. These Auto-Encoders are formulated under two types of Graph-Embedding, namely, local and global variance-based embedding. This Graph-Embedding explores the relationship between samples and multi-layers of Auto-Encoder project the input features into new feature space. The last layer of this proposed architecture is Graph-Embedded regression-based one-class classifier. The Auto-Encoders use an unsupervised approach of learning and the final layer uses semi-supervised (trained by only positive samples and obtained closed-form solution) approach to learning. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on 21 publicly available benchmark datasets. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed one-class classifiers over 11 existing state-of-the-art kernel-based one-class classifiers. Friedman test is also performed to verify the statistical significance of the claim of the superiority of the proposed one-class classifiers over the existing state-of-the-art methods. By using two types of Graph-Embedding, 4 variants of Graph-Embedded multi-layer KRR-based one-class classifier has been presented in this paper. All 4 variants performed better than the existing one-class classifiers in terms of various discussed criteria in this paper. Hence, it can be a viable alternative for OCC task. In the future, various other types of Auto-Encoders can be explored within proposed architecture.

**Validation of Association**

Recognizing, quantifying and visualizing associations between two variables is increasingly important. This paper investigates how a new function-valued measure of dependence, the quantile dependence function, can be used to construct tests for independence and to provide an easily interpretable diagnostic plot of existing departures from the null model. The dependence function is designed to detect general dependence structure between variables in quantiles of the joint distribution. It gives an insight into how the dependence structures changes in different parts of the joint distribution. We define new estimators of the dependence function, discuss some of their properties, and apply them to construct new tests of independence. Numerical evidence is given on the test’s benefits against three recognized independence tests introduced in the previous years. In real-data analysis, we illustrate the use of our tests and the graphical presentation of the underlying dependence structure.

**HAKE: Human Activity Knowledge Engine**

Human activity understanding is crucial for building automatic intelligent system. With the help of deep learning, activity understanding has made huge progress recently. But some challenges such as imbalanced data distribution, action ambiguity, complex visual patterns still remain. To address these and promote the activity understanding, we build a large-scale Human Activity Knowledge Engine (HAKE) based on the human body part states. Upon existing activity datasets, we annotate the part states of all the active persons in all images, thus establish the relationship between instance activity and body part states. Furthermore, we propose a HAKE based part state recognition model with a knowledge extractor named Activity2Vec and a corresponding part state based reasoning network. With HAKE, our method can alleviate the learning difficulty brought by the long-tail data distribution, and bring in interpretability. Now our HAKE has more than 7 M+ part state annotations and is still under construction. We first validate our approach on a part of HAKE in this preliminary paper, where we show 7.2 mAP performance improvement on Human-Object Interaction recognition, and 12.38 mAP improvement on the one-shot subsets.

**Self-Paced Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Data with Outliers**

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular tool for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in data analysis. There is a probabilistic version of PCA, known as Probabilistic PCA (PPCA). However, standard PCA and PPCA are not robust, as they are sensitive to outliers. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces the Self-Paced Learning mechanism into PPCA, and proposes a novel method called Self-Paced Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (SP-PPCA). Furthermore, we design the corresponding optimization algorithm based on the alternative search strategy and the expectation-maximization algorithm. SP-PPCA looks for optimal projection vectors and filters out outliers iteratively. Experiments on both synthetic problems and real-world datasets clearly demonstrate that SP-PPCA is able to reduce or eliminate the impact of outliers.

**What Makes Social Search Efficient**

The idea of the small world first put forth by Milgram in the 1960’s shows empirically how people knowing reliably only connections to their direct contacts can leverage their knowledge to perform an efficient global search, referred to as social search, in surprisingly few steps. Later, it was established that social networks are often interconnected in such a way that knowledge of all the edges enables a search in even a smaller number of step; such networks are often called small-world networks. Yet, despite a diverse body of work on the social search and its efficiency, it has been unclear why nodes with limited knowledge of just direct links are able to route efficiently. To probe this question, here we use a real location-based social network, Gowalla, to emulate a synthetic social search task. The results demonstrate that the spatial distributions of friends, and friends of friends (FoF) as well as the types of information utilized for search play a key role in effective social search. We also establish that neither the ways nodes are embedded into space nor edges distributed among nodes are important for social search efficiency. Moreover, we show that even very limited knowledge of friends of friends significantly improves social search performance with gains growing most rapidly for small fractions of FoF knowledge.

**GA-Net: Guided Aggregation Net for End-to-end Stereo Matching**

In the stereo matching task, matching cost aggregation is crucial in both traditional methods and deep neural network models in order to accurately estimate disparities. We propose two novel neural net layers, aimed at capturing local and the whole-image cost dependencies respectively. The first is a semi-global aggregation layer which is a differentiable approximation of the semi-global matching, the second is the local guided aggregation layer which follows a traditional cost filtering strategy to refine thin structures. These two layers can be used to replace the widely used 3D convolutional layer which is computationally costly and memory-consuming as it has cubic computational/memory complexity. In the experiments, we show that nets with a two-layer guided aggregation block easily outperform the state-of-the-art GC-Net which has nineteen 3D convolutional layers. We also train a deep guided aggregation network (GA-Net) which gets better accuracies than state-of-the-art methods on both Scene Flow dataset and KITTI benchmarks.

**Minimum Error Entropy Kalman Filter**

To date most linear and nonlinear Kalman filters (KFs) have been developed under the Gaussian assumption and the well-known minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. In order to improve the robustness with respect to impulsive (or heavy-tailed) non-Gaussian noises, the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been used to replace the MMSE criterion in developing several robust Kalman-type filters. To deal with more complicated non-Gaussian noises such as noises from multimodal distributions, in the present paper we develop a new Kalman-type filter, called minimum error entropy Kalman filter (MEE-KF), by using the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion instead of the MMSE or MCC. Similar to the MCC based KFs, the proposed filter is also an online algorithm with recursive process, in which the propagation equations are used to give prior estimates of the state and covariance matrix, and a fixed-point algorithm is used to update the posterior estimates. In addition, the minimum error entropy extended Kalman filter (MEE-EKF) is also developed for performance improvement in the nonlinear situations. The high accuracy and strong robustness of MEE-KF and MEE-EKF are confirmed by experimental results.

**Should I Raise The Red Flag? A comprehensive survey of anomaly scoring methods toward mitigating false alarms**

A general Intrusion Detection System (IDS) fundamentally acts based on an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) or a combination of anomaly detection and signature-based methods, gathering and analyzing observations and reporting possible suspicious cases to a system administrator or the other users for further investigation. One of the notorious challenges which even the state-of-the-art ADS and IDS have not overcome is the possibility of a very high false alarms rate. Especially in very large and complex system settings, the amount of low-level alarms easily overwhelms administrators and increases their tendency to ignore alerts. We can group the existing false alarm mitigation strategies into two main families: The first group covers the methods directly customized and applied toward higher quality anomaly scoring in ADS. The second group includes approaches utilized in the related contexts as a filtering method toward decreasing the possibility of false alarm rates.Given the lack of a comprehensive study regarding possible ways to mitigate the false alarm rates, in this paper, we review the existing techniques for false alarm mitigation in ADS and present the pros and cons of each technique. We also study a few promising techniques applied in the signature-based IDS and other related contexts like commercial Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, which are applicable and promising in the ADS context. Finally, we conclude with some directions for future research.

**Exploring Representativeness and Informativeness for Active Learning**

How can we find a general way to choose the most suitable samples for training a classifier? Even with very limited prior information? Active learning, which can be regarded as an iterative optimization procedure, plays a key role to construct a refined training set to improve the classification performance in a variety of applications, such as text analysis, image recognition, social network modeling, etc. Although combining representativeness and informativeness of samples has been proven promising for active sampling, state-of-the-art methods perform well under certain data structures. Then can we find a way to fuse the two active sampling criteria without any assumption on data? This paper proposes a general active learning framework that effectively fuses the two criteria. Inspired by a two-sample discrepancy problem, triple measures are elaborately designed to guarantee that the query samples not only possess the representativeness of the unlabeled data but also reveal the diversity of the labeled data. Any appropriate similarity measure can be employed to construct the triple measures. Meanwhile, an uncertain measure is leveraged to generate the informativeness criterion, which can be carried out in different ways. Rooted in this framework, a practical active learning algorithm is proposed, which exploits a radial basis function together with the estimated probabilities to construct the triple measures and a modified Best-versus-Second-Best strategy to construct the uncertain measure, respectively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art active learning algorithms.

**Robust and Discriminative Labeling for Multi-label Active Learning Based on Maximum Correntropy Criterion**

Multi-label learning draws great interests in many real world applications. It is a highly costly task to assign many labels by the oracle for one instance. Meanwhile, it is also hard to build a good model without diagnosing discriminative labels. Can we reduce the label costs and improve the ability to train a good model for multi-label learning simultaneously? Active learning addresses the less training samples problem by querying the most valuable samples to achieve a better performance with little costs. In multi-label active learning, some researches have been done for querying the relevant labels with less training samples or querying all labels without diagnosing the discriminative information. They all cannot effectively handle the outlier labels for the measurement of uncertainty. Since Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC) provides a robust analysis for outliers in many machine learning and data mining algorithms, in this paper, we derive a robust multi-label active learning algorithm based on MCC by merging uncertainty and representativeness, and propose an efficient alternating optimization method to solve it. With MCC, our method can eliminate the influence of outlier labels that are not discriminative to measure the uncertainty. To make further improvement on the ability of information measurement, we merge uncertainty and representativeness with the prediction labels of unknown data. It can not only enhance the uncertainty but also improve the similarity measurement of multi-label data with labels information. Experiments on benchmark multi-label data sets have shown a superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

**BERT4Rec: Sequential Recommendation with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer**

Modeling users’ dynamic and evolving preferences from their historical behaviors is challenging and crucial for recommendation systems. Previous methods employ sequential neural networks (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) to encode users’ historical interactions from left to right into hidden representations for making recommendations. Although these methods achieve satisfactory results, they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not always practical. We argue that such left-to-right unidirectional architectures restrict the power of the historical sequence representations. For this purpose, we introduce a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for sequential Recommendation (BERT4Rec). However, jointly conditioning on both left and right context in deep bidirectional model would make the training become trivial since each item can indirectly “see the target item”. To address this problem, we train the bidirectional model using the Cloze task, predicting the masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and right context. Comparing with predicting the next item at each position in a sequence, the Cloze task can produce more samples to train a more powerful bidirectional model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.

**Text segmentation on multilabel documents: A distant-supervised approach**

Segmenting text into semantically coherent segments is an important task with applications in information retrieval and text summarization. Developing accurate topical segmentation requires the availability of training data with ground truth information at the segment level. However, generating such labeled datasets, especially for applications in which the meaning of the labels is user-defined, is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we develop an approach that instead of using segment-level ground truth information, it instead uses the set of labels that are associated with a document and are easier to obtain as the training data essentially corresponds to a multilabel dataset. Our method, which can be thought of as an instance of distant supervision, improves upon the previous approaches by exploiting the fact that consecutive sentences in a document tend to talk about the same topic, and hence, probably belong to the same class. Experiments on the text segmentation task on a variety of datasets show that the segmentation produced by our method beats the competing approaches on four out of five datasets and performs at par on the fifth dataset. On the multilabel text classification task, our method performs at par with the competing approaches, while requiring significantly less time to estimate than the competing approaches.

**A Short Survey On Memory Based Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning which is employed to solve various sequential decision making problems without proper supervision. Due to the recent advancement of deep learning, the newly proposed Deep-RL algorithms have been able to perform extremely well in sophisticated high-dimensional environments. However, even after successes in many domains, one of the major challenge in these approaches is the high magnitude of interactions with the environment required for efficient decision making. Seeking inspiration from the brain, this problem can be solved by incorporating instance based learning by biasing the decision making on the memories of high rewarding experiences. This paper reviews various recent reinforcement learning methods which incorporate external memory to solve decision making and a survey of them is presented. We provide an overview of the different methods – along with their advantages and disadvantages, applications and the standard experimentation settings used for memory based models. This review hopes to be a helpful resource to provide key insight of the recent advances in the field and provide help in further future development of it.
