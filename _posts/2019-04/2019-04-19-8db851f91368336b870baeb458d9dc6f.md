** NEW! ** Fraud Analytics & Anomaly Detection

*September 23rd, 2019 - 8:30 am - 4:30 pm*

Dramatically reducing fraud and other abuse is a challenging task requiring a comprehensive and flexible analytics solution. Wherever your organization is along the wide spectrum of fraud analytics capabilities -- from basic rules and reporting to complex network graph analysis – this workshop will show you how to build out all the components of a holistic and robust fraud analytics platform. We will review critical technical details as well as problems to watch out for based on lessons learned over years of consulting on real-world fraud cases.

This one-day session teaches best practices for fraud analytics constrained by the realities of incomplete data and unrecognized or emerging fraud patterns. Existing fraud models have proven value, but nagging concerns remain about “unknown unknowns”.  A new view of the problem is required.

Attendees will learn how to:


Use new unsupervised learning techniques to identify previously unseen cases of fraud


Recognize and remove common biases
(such as stemming from rare known fraud cases and from selection effects)


Prioritize anomaly types by their fraud likelihood


Incorporate multiple techniques and processes into an effective anti-fraud platform

**The Best of Predictive Analytics: Core Machine Learning and Data Science Techniques**

*September 24th, 2019 - 8:30 am - 4:30 pm*

This one-day session surveys standard and advanced methods for predictive modeling (aka machine learning). In this workshop, renowned practitioner and hugely popular instructor Dr. John Elder will describe the key inner workings of leading machine learning algorithms, demonstrate their performance with business case studies, compare their merits, and show you how to select the method and tool best suited to each predictive analytics project.

Attendees will leave with an understanding of the most popular algorithms, including classical regression, decision trees, nearest neighbors, and neural networks, as well as innovative ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and random forests.

This workshop will also cover useful ways to visualize, select, reduce, and engineer features – such as principal components and projection pursuit. Most importantly, Dr. Elder reveals how the essential resampling techniques of cross-validation and bootstrapping make your models robust and reliable. Throughout the workshop day, Dr. Elder will share his (often humorous) stories from real-world applications, highlighting mistakes to avoid.

*If you’d like to become a practitioner of predictive analytics – or if you already are and would like to hone your knowledge across methods and best practices – this workshop is for you.*

**** NEW! ** Data Science for Managers***September 26th, 2019 - 8:30 am - 4:30 pm*

This 1-day workshop is an introduction to data science for executives and managers of data science programs. It provides a high-level overview of modern data science concepts, tools, and techniques from a management perspective. All stages of the data science lifecycle will be discussed in the context of agile management methodologies using real-world case studies. Managers will learn how to identify skilled data scientists and build data science teams that use sound scientific methods to meet their organization’s objectives. Leaders will learn to ask the right questions, solve the right problems, keep data science projects on track, ensure their solutions are deployed and avoid common pitfalls along the way. Both technical and non-technical participants will benefit from this workshop and be equipped with the knowledge necessary to lead effective data science programs in their organizations.

Participants will learn how to:


Understand fundamental concepts of data science


Plan and manage the data science project lifecycle using agile techniques


Define the appropriate data science problem to solve


Build effective data science teams within an organization


Avoid common pitfalls in data science management
