In the latest KDnuggets poll, readers were asked:

**Which Data Science / Machine Learning methods and algorithms did you use in 2018/2019 for a real-world application?**

The results, based on 833 voters, show that the top 17 methods are the same as in the 2017 poll, although in slightly different order:

**Fig. 1: Top Data Science, Machine Learning Methods Used, 2018/2019**

 

The top 17 methods by respondent usage this year (spot #16 was a tie, by percentage) are:

Regression
Decision Trees / Rules
Clustering
Visualization
Random Forests
Statistics - Descriptive
K-Nearest Neighbours
Time Series
Ensemble Methods
Text Mining
PCA
Boosting
Neural Networks - Deep Learning
Gradient Boosted Machines
Anomaly / Deviation Detection
Neural Networks - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This, in turn, mirrors the results of the 2017 poll, which found that the top 10 methods remained unchanged from the 2016 poll (although, again, they were in a different order).

The average respondent used 7.4 methods/algorithms, which is in-line with both the 2017 and 2016 results.

Below is a comparison of the top methods and algorithms in this year's poll with their 2017 shares.

**Fig. 2: Top Data Science, Machine Learning Methods Used, 2018/9 vs 2017**

 

The most notable increases this year were found in the usage of various neural network technologies, including GANs, RNNs, CNNs, reinforcement learning, and vanilla deep neural networks. Genetic and evolutionary algorithms have also found an increase, along with the catch-all "Other Methods."

The methods and algorithms with the greatest relative increases measured by (*share2019 / share2017 - 1*) over 2017 are:

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**, 101.8% up, from 2.3% share in 2017 to 4.7% share in 2018/9
**Neural Networks - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**, 56.5% up, from 10.5% to 16.5%
**Reinforcement Learning**, 56.1% up, from 4.2% to 6.6%
**Neural Nets - Convolution**, 38.8% up, from 15.8% to 22%
**Other Methods**, 27.1% up, from 6.1% to 7.8%
**Genetic / Evolutionary Algorithms & Methods**, 25.7% up, from 4.8% to 6.0%
**Neural Networks - Deep Learning**, 23.5% up, from 20.6% to 25%

The greatest declines this year were:

**SVD**, 25.4% down, from 8.1% share in 2017 to 6.0% share in 2018/9
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, 23.3% down, from 28.7% to 22%
**Factor Analysis**, 21.2% down, from 11.7% to 9.3%
**Association Rules**, 20.6% down, from 15.4% to 12.3%
**PCA**, 19.3% down, from 34.7% to 28%
**Survival Analysis**, 19.1% down, from 8.5% to 6.9%

 

### Affiliation

 Participation by affiliation was:

Industry / Self employed, 64.9% (541 responses), 7.8 avg. tools used
