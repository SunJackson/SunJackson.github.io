DALEX is a set of tools for explanation, exploration and debugging of predictive models. The nice thing about it is that it can be easily connected to different model factories.

Recently Michal Maj wrote a nice vignette how to use DALEX with models created in keras (an open-source neural-network library in python with an R interface created by RStudio). Find the vignette here.Michal compared a keras model against deeplearning from h2o package, so you can check which model won on the Titanic dataset.

Next nice vignette was created by [Szymon Maksymiuk](http://smarterpoland.pl/index.php/2019/04/dalex-for-keras-and-parsnip/). In this vignette Szymon shows how to use DALEX with parsnip models (parsnip is a part of the tidymodels ecosystem, created by Max Kuhn and Davis Vaughan). Models like boost_tree, mlp and svm_rbf are competing on the Titanic data.

These two new vignettes add to our collection how to use DALEX with mlr, caret, h2o and others model factories.
