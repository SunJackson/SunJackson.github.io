**A** rather blah number Le Monde mathematical puzzle:

> 
*Find all integer multiples of 11111 with exactly one occurrence of each decimal digit..*


Which I solved by brute force, by looking at the possible range of multiples (and  borrowing stringr:str_count from Robin!)

And a bonus one:

> 
*Find all integers y that can write both as x³ and (10z)³+a with 1≤a≤999.*


which does not offer much in terms of solutions since x³-v³=(x-v)(x²+xv+v²)=a shows that x² is less than 2a/3, meaning x is at most 25. Among such numbers only x=11,12 lead to a solution as x³=1331,1728.
