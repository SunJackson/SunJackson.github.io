The richness and variety of packages for building and fitting statistical models in R is absolutely astonishing and contributes to the languageâ€™s popularity. However, **this diversity makes it hard for developpers** that want to create tools that work with different types of models. Indeed, the way to access modelsâ€™ internal information (such as **parameters names**, **formulae**, **data**, etc.) is **not unified**, forcing the developers to spend some time figuring out how to do it for each model type.

**This time is over!**

## Insight

Recently, we have decided to collaborate around the new easystats project, a set of packages designed to make your life easier (currently very work in progress). However, in order to create these packages and functions, **we needed a basis**, a stable cornerstone, that would allow the unified way of accessing models information.

And **`insight`** was born.

The goal of insight is to provide tools to help an **easy, intuitive and consistent accesss** to information contained in various models. Indeed, although there are generic functions to get information and data from models, many modelling-functions from different packages do not provide such methods to access these information. The insight package aims at closing this gap by providing functions that work for (almost) any model.

`insight` can be installed as follows:

```
install.packages("insight") # Install from CRAN
library(insight) # Load the package
```

## Example

Letâ€™s see how it works on a very simple regression model:

```
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data=iris)
```

```
find_parameters(model)
```

```
> $conditional
> [1] "(Intercept)" "Speciesversicolor" "Speciesvirginica"
```

- Find the **outcomeâ€™s name**:


```
find_response(model)
```

```
> [1] "Sepal.Length"
```

```
find_formula(model)
```

```
> $conditional
> Sepal.Length ~ Species
```

- Find the **variables in the formula**:


```
find_variables(model)
```

```
> $response
> [1] "Sepal.Length"
> 
> $conditional
> [1] "Species"
```

```
find_algorithm(model)
```

```
> $algorithm
> [1] "OLS"
```

Moreover, `insight` also includes functions to deal with **Bayesian** (`get_priors()`) and **mixed models** (`find_random()`).

`insight` works on a high number of models (see the **list here**), and **continue to grow thanks to your suggestions**! As *easystats* is a new project in active development, do not hesitate to contact us if **you want to get involved ðŸ™‚**
