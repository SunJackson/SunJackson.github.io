A couple of days ago I mentioned that on **Wednesday, April 10th at 10AM EST** I am launching a Kickstarter for my new book, *Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision.*

As you’ll see later in this post, there is a *huge* amount of content I’ll be covering, so I’ve decided to break the book down into ***three volumes*** called ***“bundles”.***

A ***bundle*** includes the eBook and source code for a given volume (as well as a pre-configured Raspbian .img file with all the computer vision + deep learning libraries you need pre-installed).

Each bundle *builds on top of the others* and *includes all content from lower bundles.* You should choose a bundle based on how in-depth you want to study CV and DL on the Pi, which projects/chapters interest you the most, along with your particular budget:

- **Hobbyist Bundle:** A great fit if this is your first time you’re working with computer vision or the Raspberry Pi. Here you’ll learn basic computer vision algorithms that can easily be applied to the Pi. You’ll build hands-on applications including a wildlife monitor/detector, home video surveillance, pan/tilt servo tracking, *and more!*

- **Hacker Bundle:** Perfect for readers who want to learn more advanced techniques, including deep learning, working with the Movidius NCS, OpenVINO toolkit, and self-driving car applications. You’ll also learn my tips, suggestions, and best practices when applying computer vision on the Raspberry Pi.

- **Complete Bundle:** The *full Raspberry Pi and computer vision experience.* You’ll have **access to every chapter in the book**, **video tutorials**, a **hardcopy of the text**, and **access to my *private* community and forums** for additional help and support.


The complete Table of Contents for each bundle is listed in the next section.

## Hobbyist Bundle

- Learn how to **track faces and objects with pan/tilt servo tracking**


**Human Activity and Home Surveillance**

- Build a **basic video surveillance system** and detect when people enter “unauthorized” zones

- **Deploy your Raspberry Pi to vehicles** and detect tired, drowsy drivers (and sound an alarm to wake them up)

- Build an **automatic people/footfall counter** to count the number of people entering and leaving a store, house, etc.


**Tips, Suggestions, and Best Practices**

- Learn about **OpenCV optimizations,** including **OpenCL** and how to access *all four cores *of the Raspberry Pi, boosting your system performance

- Discover my blueprint on how to **design your own computer vision + Raspberry Pi applications for optimal performance**
