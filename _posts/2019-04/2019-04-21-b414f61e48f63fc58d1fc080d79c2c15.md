**Topological based classification of paper domains using graph convolutional networks**

The main approaches for node classification in graphs are information propagation and the association of the class of the node with external information. State of the art methods merge these approaches through Graph Convolutional Networks. We here use the association of topological features of the nodes with their class to predict this class. Moreover, combining topological information with information propagation improves classification accuracy on the standard CiteSeer and Cora paper classification task. Topological features and information propagation produce results almost as good as text-based classification, without no textual or content information. We propose to represent the topology and information propagation through a GCN with the neighboring training node classification as an input and the current node classification as output. Such a formalism outperforms state of the art methods.

**Advanced Customer Activity Prediction based on Deep Hierarchic Encoder-Decoders**

Product recommender systems and customer profiling techniques have always been a priority in online retail. Recent machine learning research advances and also wide availability of massive parallel numerical computing has enabled various approaches and directions of recommender systems advancement. Worth to mention is the fact that in past years multiple traditional ‘offline’ retail business are gearing more and more towards employing inferential and even predictive analytics both to stock-related problems such as predictive replenishment but also to enrich customer interaction experience. One of the most important areas of recommender systems research and development is that of Deep Learning based models which employ representational learning to model consumer behavioral patterns. Current state of the art in Deep Learning based recommender systems uses multiple approaches ranging from already classical methods such as the ones based on learning product representation vector, to recurrent analysis of customer transactional time-series and up to generative models based on adversarial training. Each of these methods has multiple advantages and inherent weaknesses such as inability of understanding the actual user-journey, ability to propose only single product recommendation or top-k product recommendations without prediction of actual next-best-offer. In our work we will present a new and innovative architectural approach of applying state-of-the-art hierarchical multi-module encoder-decoder architecture in order to solve several of current state-of-the-art recommender systems issues. Our approach will also produce by-products such as product need-based segmentation and customer behavioral segmentation – all in an end-to-end trainable approach.

**Graph Wavelet Neural Network**

We present graph wavelet neural network (GWNN), a novel graph convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging graph wavelet transform to address the shortcomings of previous spectral graph CNN methods that depend on graph Fourier transform. Different from graph Fourier transform, graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high efficiency and good interpretability for graph convolution. The proposed GWNN significantly outperforms previous spectral graph CNNs in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification on three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.

**Low-Rank Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Task Learning**

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning method based on the deep convolutional network. The proposed deep network has four convolutional layers, three max-pooling layers, and two parallel fully connected layers. To adjust the deep network to multi-task learning problem, we propose to learn a low-rank deep network so that the relation among different tasks can be explored. We proposed to minimize the number of independent parameter rows of one fully connected layer to explore the relations among different tasks, which is measured by the nuclear norm of the parameter of one fully connected layer, and seek a low-rank parameter matrix. Meanwhile, we also propose to regularize another fully connected layer by sparsity penalty, so that the useful features learned by the lower layers can be selected. The learning problem is solved by an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and back-propagation algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over benchmark data sets of multiple face attribute prediction, multi-task natural language processing, and joint economics index predictions. The evaluation results show the advantage of the low-rank deep CNN model over multi-task problems.

**Short Text Topic Modeling Techniques, Applications, and Performance: A Survey**

Analyzing short texts infers discriminative and coherent latent topics that is a critical and fundamental task since many real-world applications require semantic understanding of short texts. Traditional long text topic modeling algorithms (e.g., PLSA and LDA) based on word co-occurrences cannot solve this problem very well since only very limited word co-occurrence information is available in short texts. Therefore, short text topic modeling has already attracted much attention from the machine learning research community in recent years, which aims at overcoming the problem of sparseness in short texts. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of various short text topic modeling techniques proposed in the literature. We present three categories of methods based on Dirichlet multinomial mixture, global word co-occurrences, and self-aggregation, with example of representative approaches in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We develop the first comprehensive open-source library, called STTM, for use in Java that integrates all surveyed algorithms within a unified interface, benchmark datasets, to facilitate the expansion of new methods in this research field. Finally, we evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on many real-world datasets and compare their performance against one another and versus long text topic modeling algorithm.

**Bounded and Approximate Strong Satisfiability in Workflows**

There has been a considerable amount of interest in recent years in the problem of workflow satisfiability, which asks whether the existence of constraints in a workflow specification makes it impossible to allocate authorized users to each step in the workflow. Recent developments have seen the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) studied in the context of workflow specifications in which the set of steps may vary from one instance of the workflow to another. This, in turn, means that some constraints may only apply to certain workflow instances. Inevitably, WSP becomes more complex for such workflow specifications. Other approaches have considered the possibility of associating costs with the violation of `soft’ constraints and authorizations. Workflow satisfiability in this context becomes a question of minimizing the cost of allocating users to steps in the workflow. In this paper, we introduce new problems, which we believe to be of practical relevance, that combine these approaches. In particular, we consider the question of whether, given a workflow specification with costs and a `budget’, all possible workflow instances have an allocation of users to steps that does not exceed the budget. We design a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to solve this problem parameterized by the total number of steps, release points and xor branchings.

**Three scenarios for continual learning**

Standard artificial neural networks suffer from the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, making continual or lifelong learning difficult for machine learning. In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more structured comparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at test time task identity is provided and–in case it is not–whether it must be inferred. Any sequence of well-defined tasks can be performed according to each scenario. Using the split and permuted MNIST task protocols, for each scenario we carry out an extensive comparison of recently proposed continual learning methods. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difficulty and in terms of how efficient different methods are. In particular, when task identity must be inferred (i.e., class incremental learning), we find that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) fail and that replaying representations of previous experiences seems required for solving this scenario.

**Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits**

Multi-armed bandits a simple but very powerful framework for algorithms that make decisions over time under uncertainty. An enormous body of work has accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained, teachable technical introduction and a review of the more advanced results. The chapters are as follows: Stochastic bandits; Lower bounds; Bayesian Bandits and Thompson Sampling; Lipschitz Bandits; Full Feedback and Adversarial Costs; Adversarial Bandits; Linear Costs and Semi-bandits; Contextual Bandits; Bandits and Zero-Sum Games; Bandits with Knapsacks; Incentivized Exploration and Connections to Mechanism Design. Status of the manuscript: essentially complete (modulo some polishing), except for last chapter, which the author plans to add over the next few months.

**Latent Code and Text-based Generative Adversarial Networks for Soft-text Generation**

Text generation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be divided into the text-based and code-based categories according to the type of signals used for discrimination. In this work, we introduce a novel text-based approach called Soft-GAN to effectively exploit GAN setup for text generation. We demonstrate how autoencoders (AEs) can be used for providing a continuous representation of sentences, which we will refer to as soft-text. This soft representation will be used in GAN discrimination to synthesize similar soft-texts. We also propose hybrid latent code and text-based GAN (LATEXT-GAN) approaches with one or more discriminators, in which a combination of the latent code and the soft-text is used for GAN discriminations. We perform a number of subjective and objective experiments on two well-known datasets (SNLI and Image COCO) to validate our techniques. We discuss the results using several evaluation metrics and show that the proposed techniques outperform the traditional GAN-based text-generation methods.

**CryptoNN: Training Neural Networks over Encrypted Data**

Emerging neural networks based machine learning techniques such as deep learning and its variants have shown tremendous potential in many application domains. However, they raise serious privacy concerns due to the risk of leakage of highly privacy-sensitive data when data collected from users is used to train neural network models to support predictive tasks. To tackle such serious privacy concerns, several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed in the literature that use either secure multi-party computation (SMC) or homomorphic encryption (HE) as the underlying mechanisms. However, neither of these cryptographic approaches provides an efficient solution towards constructing a privacy-preserving machine learning model, as well as supporting both the training and inference phases. To tackle the above issue, we propose a CryptoNN framework that supports training a neural network model over encrypted data by using the emerging functional encryption scheme instead of SMC or HE. We also construct a functional encryption scheme for basic arithmetic computation to support the requirement of the proposed CryptoNN framework. We present performance evaluation and security analysis of the underlying crypto scheme and show through our experiments that CryptoNN achieves accuracy that is similar to those of the baseline neural network models on the MNIST dataset.

**Fast Inference in Capsule Networks Using Accumulated Routing Coefficients**

We present a method for fast inference in Capsule Networks (CapsNets) by taking advantage of a key insight regarding the routing coefficients that link capsules between adjacent network layers. Since the routing coefficients are responsible for assigning object parts to wholes, and an object whole generally contains similar intra-class and dissimilar inter-class parts, the routing coefficients tend to form a unique signature for each object class. For fast inference, a network is first trained in the usual manner using examples from the training dataset. Afterward, the routing coefficients associated with the training examples are accumulated offline and used to create a set of ‘master’ routing coefficients. During inference, these master routing coefficients are used in place of the dynamically calculated routing coefficients. Our method effectively replaces the for-loop iterations in the dynamic routing procedure with a single matrix multiply operation, providing a significant boost in inference speed. Compared with the dynamic routing procedure, fast inference decreases the test accuracy for the MNIST, Background MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Rotated MNIST datasets by less than 0.5% and by approximately 5% for CIFAR10.

**Incentivized Blockchain-based Social Media Platforms: A Case Study of Steemit**

This paper presents an empirical analysis of Steemit, a key representative of the emerging incentivized social media platforms over Blockchains, to understand and evaluate the actual level of decentralization and the practical effects of cryptocurrency-driven reward system in these modern social media platforms. Similar to Bitcoin, Steemit is operated by a decentralized community, where 21 members are periodically elected to cooperatively operate the platform through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. Our study performed on 539 million operations performed by 1.12 million Steemit users during the period 2016/03 to 2018/08 reveals that the actual level of decentralization in Steemit is far lower than the ideal level, indicating that the DPoS consensus protocol may not be a desirable approach for establishing a highly decentralized social media platform. In Steemit, users create contents as posts which get curated based on votes from other users. The platform periodically issues cryptocurrency as rewards to creators and curators of popular posts. Although such a reward system is originally driven by the desire to incentivize users to contribute to high-quality contents, our analysis of the underlying cryptocurrency transfer network on the blockchain reveals that more than 16% transfers of cryptocurrency in Steemit are sent to curators suspected to be bots and also finds the existence of an underlying supply network for the bots, both suggesting a significant misuse of the current reward system in Steemit. Our study is designed to provide insights on the current state of this emerging blockchain-based social media platform including the effectiveness of its design and the operation of the consensus protocols and the reward system.

**Helping Effects Against Curse of Dimensionality in Threshold Factor Models for Matrix Time Series**

As is known, factor analysis is a popular method to reduce dimension for high-dimensional data. For matrix data, the dimension reduction can be more effectively achieved through both row and column directions. In this paper, we introduce a threshold factor models to analyze matrix-valued high-dimensional time series data. The factor loadings are allowed to switch between regimes, controlling by a threshold variable. The estimation methods for loading spaces, threshold value, and the number of factors are proposed. The asymptotic properties of these estimators are investigated. Not only the strengths of thresholding and factors, but also their interactions from different directions and different regimes play an important role on the estimation performance. When the thresholding and factors are all strong across regimes, the estimation is immune to the impact that the increase of dimension brings, which breaks the curse of dimensionality. When the thresholding in two directions and factors across regimes have different levels of strength, we show that estimators for loadings and threshold value experience ‘helping’ effects against the curse of dimensionality. We also discover that even when the numbers of factors are overestimated, the estimators are still consistent. The proposed methods are illustrated with both simulated and real examples.

**What I See Is What You See: Joint Attention Learning for First and Third Person Video Co-analysis**

In recent years, more and more videos are captured from the first-person viewpoint by wearable cameras. Such first-person video provides additional information besides the traditional third-person video, and thus has a wide range of applications. However, techniques for analyzing the first-person video can be fundamentally different from those for the third-person video, and it is even more difficult to explore the shared information from both viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel method for first- and third-person video co-analysis. At the core of our method is the notion of ‘joint attention’, indicating the learnable representation that corresponds to the shared attention regions in different viewpoints and thus links the two viewpoints. To this end, we develop a multi-branch deep network with a triplet loss to extract the joint attention from the first- and third-person videos via self-supervised learning. We evaluate our method on the public dataset with cross-viewpoint video matching tasks. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also demonstrate how the learned joint attention can benefit various applications through a set of additional experiments.

**DSTP-RNN: a dual-stage two-phase attention-based recurrent neural networks for long-term and multivariate time series prediction**

Long-term prediction of multivariate time series is still an important but challenging problem. The key to solve this problem is to capture the spatial correlations at the same time, the spatio-temporal relationships at different times and the long-term dependence of the temporal relationships between different series. Attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) can effectively represent the dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between exogenous series and target series, but it only performs well in one-step time prediction and short-term time prediction. In this paper, inspired by human attention mechanism including the dual-stage two-phase (DSTP) model and the influence mechanism of target information and non-target information, we propose dual-stage two-phase-based recurrent neural network (DSTP-RNN) and DSTP-RNN-2 respectively for long-term time series prediction. Specifically, we first propose the DSTP-based structure to enhance the spatial correlations between exogenous series. The first phase produces violent but decentralized response weight, while the second phase leads to stationary and concentrated response weight. Secondly, we employ multiple attentions on target series to boost the long-term dependence. Finally, we study the performance of deep spatial attention mechanism and provide experiment and interpretation. Our methods outperform nine baseline methods on four datasets in the fields of energy, finance, environment and medicine, respectively.

**Discriminative Regression Machine: A Classifier for High-Dimensional Data or Imbalanced Data**

We introduce a discriminative regression approach to supervised classification in this paper. It estimates a representation model while accounting for discriminativeness between classes, thereby enabling accurate derivation of categorical information. This new type of regression models extends existing models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso through explicitly incorporating discriminative information. As a special case we focus on a quadratic model that admits a closed-form analytical solution. The corresponding classifier is called discriminative regression machine (DRM). Three iterative algorithms are further established for the DRM to enhance the efficiency and scalability for real applications. Our approach and the algorithms are applicable to general types of data including images, high-dimensional data, and imbalanced data. We compare the DRM with currently state-of-the-art classifiers. Our extensive experimental results show superior performance of the DRM and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**RES-PCA: A Scalable Approach to Recovering Low-rank Matrices**

Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has drawn significant attentions due to its powerful capability in recovering low-rank matrices as well as successful appplications in various real world problems. The current state-of-the-art algorithms usually need to solve singular value decomposition of large matrices, which generally has at least a quadratic or even cubic complexity. This drawback has limited the application of RPCA in solving real world problems. To combat this drawback, in this paper we propose a new type of RPCA method, RES-PCA, which is linearly efficient and scalable in both data size and dimension. For comparison purpose, AltProj, an existing scalable approach to RPCA requires the precise knowlwdge of the true rank; otherwise, it may fail to recover low-rank matrices. By contrast, our method works with or without knowing the true rank; even when both methods work, our method is faster. Extensive experiments have been performed and testified to the effectiveness of proposed method quantitatively and in visual quality, which suggests that our method is suitable to be employed as a light-weight, scalable component for RPCA in any application pipelines.

**Selection Bias in News Coverage: Learning it, Fighting it**

News entities must select and filter the coverage they broadcast through their respective channels since the set of world events is too large to be treated exhaustively. The subjective nature of this filtering induces biases due to, among other things, resource constraints, editorial guidelines, ideological affinities, or even the fragmented nature of the information at a journalist’s disposal. The magnitude and direction of these biases are, however, widely unknown. The absence of ground truth, the sheer size of the event space, or the lack of an exhaustive set of absolute features to measure make it difficult to observe the bias directly, to characterize the leaning’s nature and to factor it out to ensure a neutral coverage of the news. In this work, we introduce a methodology to capture the latent structure of media’s decision process on a large scale. Our contribution is multi-fold. First, we show media coverage to be predictable using personalization techniques, and evaluate our approach on a large set of events collected from the GDELT database. We then show that a personalized and parametrized approach not only exhibits higher accuracy in coverage prediction, but also provides an interpretable representation of the selection bias. Last, we propose a method able to select a set of sources by leveraging the latent representation. These selected sources provide a more diverse and egalitarian coverage, all while retaining the most actively covered events.

**On the Mathematical Understanding of ResNet with Feynman Path Integral**

In this paper, we aim to understand Residual Network (ResNet) in a scientifically sound way by providing a bridge between ResNet and Feynman path integral. In particular, we prove that the effect of residual block is equivalent to partial differential equation, and the ResNet transforming process can be equivalently converted to Feynman path integral. These conclusions greatly help us mathematically understand the advantage of ResNet in addressing the gradient vanishing issue. More importantly, our analyses offer a path integral view of ResNet, and demonstrate that the output of certain network can be obtained by adding contributions of all paths. Moreover, the contribution of each path is proportional to e^{-S}, where S is the action given by time integral of Lagrangian L. This lays the solid foundation in the understanding of ResNet, and provides insights in the future design of convolutional neural network architecture. Based on these results, we have designed the network using partial differential operators, which further validates our theoritical analyses.

**Go Wide, Go Deep: Quantifying the Impact of Scientific Papers through Influence Dispersion Trees**

Despite a long history of use of citation count as a measure to assess the impact or influence of a scientific paper, the evolution of follow-up work inspired by the paper and their interactions through citation links have rarely been explored to quantify how the paper enriches the depth and breadth of a research field. We propose a novel data structure, called Influence Dispersion Tree (IDT) to model the organization of follow-up papers and their dependencies through citations. We also propose the notion of an ideal IDT for every paper and show that an ideal (highly influential) paper should increase the knowledge of a field vertically and horizontally. Upon suitably exploring the structural properties of IDT, we derive a suite of metrics, namely Influence Dispersion Index (IDI), Normalized Influence Divergence (NID) to quantify the influence of a paper. Our theoretical analysis shows that an ideal IDT configuration should have equal depth and breadth (and thus minimize the NID value). We establish the superiority of NID as a better influence measure in two experimental settings. First, on a large real-world bibliographic dataset, we show that NID outperforms raw citation count as an early predictor of the number of new citations a paper will receive within a certain period after publication. Second, we show that NID is superior to the raw citation count at identifying the papers recognized as highly influential through Test of Time Award among all their contemporary papers (published in the same venue). We conclude that in order to quantify the influence of a paper, along with the total citation count, one should also consider how the citing papers are organized among themselves to better understand the influence of a paper on the research field. For reproducibility, the code and datasets used in this study are being made available to the community.
