b. Fast operation speed

c. When the object and background have high contrast, this method performs really well
|Edge Detection Segmentation|Makes use of discontinuous local features of an image to detect edges and hence define a boundary of the object.|It is good for images having better contrast between objects.|Not suitable when there are too many edges in the image and if there is less contrast between objects.|
|Segmentation based on Clustering|Divides the pixels of the image into homogeneous clusters.|Works really well on small datasets and generates excellent clusters.|a. Computation time is too large and expensive.|

b. k-means is a distance-based algorithm. It is not suitable for clustering non-convex clusters.
|Mask R-CNN|Gives three outputs for each object in the image: its class, bounding box coordinates, and object mask|a. Simple, flexible and general approach|

b. It is also the current state-of-the-art for image segmentation

 

## End Notes

This article is just the beginning of our journey to learn all about image segmentation. In the next article of this series, we will deep dive into the implementation of Mask R-CNN. So stay tuned!

I have found image segmentation quite a useful function in my deep learning career. The level of granularity I get from these techniques is astounding. It always amazes me how much detail we are able to extract with a few lines of code. I’ve mentioned a couple of useful resources below to help you out in your computer vision journey:

I always appreciate any feedback or suggestions on my articles, so please feel free to connect with me in the comments section below.
