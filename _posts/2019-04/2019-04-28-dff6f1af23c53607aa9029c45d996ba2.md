**tl;dr** -I donâ€™t remember how many games of Clue Iâ€™ve played but I do remember being surprised by Mrs White being the murderer in only 2 of those games. Can you give an estimate and an upper bound for the number of games I have played?We solve this problem by using Bayes theorem and discussing the data generation mechanism, and illustrate the solution with R.

#### Making use of external information with Bayes theorem

 

Denote an integer n>3 and:

What we want writes as a simple product of quantities that we can compute, thanks to Bayes:

Notice that there is an â€œproportional toâ€� sign instead of an equal. This is because the denominator is just a normalization constant, which we can take care of easily after computing the likelihood and the prior.

###### Likelihood

 

Note that we canâ€™t exactly obtain the distribution for any game from 1 to infinity, so we actually compute the distribution for 1 to 200 games (this doesnâ€™t matter much in practice):

###### Prior

There are a lot of possible choices for the prior but here Iâ€™m going to consider that I donâ€™t have any real reason to believe and assume a uniform probability for any number of games between 3 and 200:

###### First posterior

Using the likelihood and the prior, we can easily compute the posterior, normalize it and plot it:

We can also compute directly the estimates weâ€™re looking for. The most probable number of games played is 11:

And there is a 95% chance that the number of games is less than 40:

#### A more realistic data generation mechanism

I find this result very unsatisfying. It doesnâ€™t â€œfeelâ€� right to me that someone would be surprised by only 2 occurrences of Mrs White being guilty in such a small number of games! For example, I simulated 40 games, a number that was supposedly suspiciously high according to the model:

![](https://i2.wp.com/nc233.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/simulations_clue-1024x726.png?w=450)


We observe that characters #4 and #5 are the murderers in respectively only 2 and 3 games!

 

In the end I think what really counts is not the likelihood that ***Mrs White*** was the murderer 2 times, but that the ***minimum*** number of times one of the characters was the culprit was 2 times!

 

I think itâ€™s a cool example of a problem where just looking at the data available is not enough to make good inference â€“ you also have to think about ***how*** the data was generated (in a way, itâ€™s sort of a twist of the Monty Hall paradox, which is one of the most famous examples of problems where the data generation mechanism is critical to understand the result).

The new posterior has the same shape but appears shifted to the right. For example N_games = 50 seems much more likely now! The estimates are now **23** for the number of games:

And **51** for the max bound of the uncertainty interval
