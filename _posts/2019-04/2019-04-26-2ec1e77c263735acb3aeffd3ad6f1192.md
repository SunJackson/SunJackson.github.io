**Histogram of Magnitude Optical Flow (HMOF)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Anomaly detection is a challenging problem in intelligent video surveillance. Most existing methods are computation consuming, which cannot satisfy the real-time requirement. In this paper, we propose a real-time anomaly detection framework with low computational complexity and high efficiency. A new feature, named Histogram of Magnitude Optical Flow (HMOF), is proposed to capture the motion of video patches. Compared with existing feature descriptors, HMOF is more sensitive to motion magnitude and more efficient to distinguish anomaly information. The HMOF features are computed for foreground patches, and are reconstructed by the auto-encoder for better clustering. Then, we use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Classifiers to distinguish anomalies from normal activities in videos. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and can reliably detect anomalies in real-time. … 

**Grabit Model (Grabit)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We introduce a novel model which is obtained by applying gradient tree boosting to the Tobit model. The so called Grabit model allows for modeling data that consist of a mixture of a continuous part and discrete point masses at the borders. Examples of this include censored data, fractional response data, corner solution response data, rainfall data, and binary classification data where additional information, that is related to the underlying classification mechanism, is available. In contrast to the Tobit model, the Grabit model can account for general forms of non-linearities and interactions, it is robust against outliers in covariates and scale invariant to monotonic transformations for the covariates, and its predictive performance is not impaired by multicollinearity. We apply the Grabit model for predicting defaults on loans made to Swiss small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), and we obtain a large improvement in predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. … 

**Viral Search** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The article, after a brief introduction on genetic algorithms and their functioning, presents a kind of genetic algorithm called Viral Search. We present the key concepts, we formally derive the algorithm and we perform numerical tests designed to illustrate the potential and limits. …
