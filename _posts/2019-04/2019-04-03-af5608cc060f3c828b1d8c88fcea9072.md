I’ve got big news to share today!

I’m super excited to announce that my ***Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision* Kickstarter campaign** is set to launch in **exactly one week** on **Wednesday, April 10th at 10AM EST.**

**Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning**, and **Internet of Things (IoT)** are three of the fastest-growing industries and subjects in computer science — **you will learn how to combine *all three* using the Raspberry Pi inside my new book.**

Whether this is the first time you’ve worked with the Raspberry Pi or you’re a hobbyist who’s been hacking with the Pi for years, ***Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision* will enable you to “bring sight” to the Pi.**

**Inside the book we will focus on:**

- Getting started with computer vision on the Raspberry Pi

- Computer vision and IoT projects on the Pi

- Servos, PID, and controlling the Pi with computer vision

- Human activity, home surveillance, and facial applications

- Deep learning on the Raspberry Pi

- Fast, efficient deep learning with the Movidius NCS and OpenVINO toolkit

- Self-driving car applications on the Raspberry Pi

- Tips, suggestions, and best practices when performing computer vision and deep learning with the RPi


I also have chapters planed on the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** and **Google Coral** as well!

As a heads up, over the next 7 days I’ll be posting a few more announcements *that you won’t want to miss*, including:

#### Thursday, April 4th 2019

**A sneak preview of the Kickstarter campaign,** including a **demo video** of what you’ll find inside the book.

#### Friday, April 5th 2019

**The Table of Contents** for ***Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision. ***This book is *practical* and *hands-on*, giving you the knowledge you need to bring CV and DL to embedded devices. You don’t want to miss this list of chapters!

#### Monday, April 8th 2019

**The full list of Kickstarter rewards *(including early bird discounts and sales).*** You’ll be able to use this list to plan ahead for which reward tier you want when the Kickstarter launches.

#### Tuesday, April 9th 2019

Please keep in mind this book is already getting *a lot* of attention so there will be **multiple people in line for each reward level** when the Kickstarter launches on Wednesday, April 10th at 10AM EST. **To help ensure you get the reward tier you want, I’ll be sharing my *tips and suggestions* you can use to ensure you’re first in line.**

#### Wednesday, April 10th 2019

**I’ll email you the Kickstarter campaign link** you can use to **claim your copy of RPi for CV, *as well as the additional discounts and sales!***
