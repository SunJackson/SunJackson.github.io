By my count, two hundred and thirty-three packages stuck to CRAN last month. I have tried to capture something of the diversity of the offerings by selecting packages in ten categories: Computational Methods, Data, Machine Learning, Medicine, Science, Shiny, Statistics, Time Series, Utilities, and Visualization. The Shiny category contains packages that expand on Shiny capabilities, not just packages that implement a Shiny application. It is not clear whether this is going to be a new cottage industry or not.

### Computational Methods

DistributionOptimization v1.2.1: Fits Gaussian mixtures by applying Genetic algorithms from the GA package using Gaussian Mixture Logic stems from AdaptGauss.

latte v0.2.1: Implements connections to `LattE` for counting lattice points and integration inside convex polytopes, and `4ti2` for algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial problems on linear spaces and front-end tools facilitating their use in the ‘R’ ecosystem. Look here for an example.
