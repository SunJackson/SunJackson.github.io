###  Introduction

If you ever heard of terms like *Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence or Data Science,* you may be fascinating that *What are these things* and *how to get started*.

To know about *Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science you can read my article:* *https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-difference-between-artificial-intelligence-ai-machine-pegwar*

And if you are already acquainted with those terms then you may be thinking that where to get started, then you are at right place.

According to be machine learning is the right place to get started because ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and it is also a tool that is used in Data Science.

###  Basic prerequisites for Machine Learning

Before diving into machine learning there are some basic prerequisites that you need to fulfil like:

1. Basics of Mathematics

1. Some Programming Knowledge

1. Most important: Josh, Himmat and Jazba like Marvel superheroes(pun intended)


Don’t worry if you do not have above-mentioned skills, you can easily learn their basics and get prepared for your Machine Learning Journey.

**Basic Mathematics**

You just need to learn some basic topics like *Linear Algebra, Probability and Basic Calculus.* you don’t need to have in-depth knowledge of these topics just understand their basic concepts.

**Programming**

If you are new to programming then don’t worry you can learn basic programming principles very quickly. You should get started with the *Python* programming language because it is very easy to learn and understand. Python is also extensively used in Machine Learning Paradigm.

There are also other programming languages that are used in Machine Learning like R, Matlab, Octave etc . but it is good to get started with Python.

Once you are done with the basics then you ready to get started with machine learning

You can learn machine learning by reading books or by joining some kind of courses.

###  Books

There are many books available that you can use to learn machine learning.

Some good books to get started are:

- Introduction to Machine Learning with Python -by O’Reilly

- Clojure for Machine Learning
