*(TL;DR: Come on. This is pretty short. Productivity level up by harnessing the power of RStudio!)*

Say we’re at work and we’ve received some data in **`Excel`**.

Let’s say that this Excel workbook contains a subset of a broader dataset. For example, maybe our Excel file contains:

- a list of customer ID numbers that we need to look into, or

- a list of dates where our data looks weird and we need to find out what has gone wrong.


Maybe the broader dataset is located within a database. Maybe we have a larger dataset within R itself. In any case, we want to use this subset of data to filter a broader dataset and get more info that might help us in our data analysis adventure!

Let’s proceed with a **`date and time related example`** given my recent obsession with time zones. We’ve been given some file of dates to look into and it looks like this:

We want to collapse these into quoted, comma-separated strings that we’ll pass into the **`c()`** function. This will give us a character vector. Once we have a character vector, we want to convert these into **`POSIXct`** values using the power of **`vectorisation!`**

In the past, I would have embarassingly done something like this to enclose each date in single quotes with a trailing comma at the end of each line:

But this requires far too many keystrokes! My new mechanical keyboard with **`CHERRY MX Brown keyswitches are rated for only 50 million keystrokes per switch`**. I must be frugal with my keystrokes!

Let’s harness the power of **`RStudio`**.


We’ll copy the values in the spreadsheet column and paste them into a new script in RStudio:

If we’re using a PC keyboard, let’s hold down **`Alt`** and click and drag the cursor down the left-hand side of each row until we reach the last line. If we’re using a Mac, we’ll have to do some Googling…but I can only assume that we should use the **`option`** key instead of the **`Alt`** key!

Let’s highlight all of our pasted text row-wise. Let’s hold down **`Alt+Shift`**, then press the **`right arrow`**.

We’ll quote them lines using another shortcut – **`Shift+'`** (**`Shift`** and the **`quotation mark key`**):
![](https://i0.wp.com/embracingtherandom.com/assets/post_images/2019-04-28-rstudio-multiple-cursors-rule-files/r-script-6.jpg?w=200&ssl=1)

While our cursor is still across all lines of the last column, we’ll **`press the comma key`**:
![](https://i1.wp.com/embracingtherandom.com/assets/post_images/2019-04-28-rstudio-multiple-cursors-rule-files/r-script-7.jpg?w=200&ssl=1)

Once we’ve removed the annoying trailing comma on the last line, we’ve got ourselves some quoted, comma-separated strings!
![](https://i2.wp.com/embracingtherandom.com/assets/post_images/2019-04-28-rstudio-multiple-cursors-rule-files/r-script-8.jpg?w=200&ssl=1)

Now we can pass these into the **`c()`** function and continue on with our lives. For example, we now have this:

```
c("26/04/2019 08:00:00",
"25/04/2019 21:30:00",
"25/04/2019 22:00:00",
"25/04/2019 18:45:00",
"25/04/2019 14:40:00",
"25/04/2019 22:00:00",
"25/04/2019 16:00:00")

```

```
## [1] "26/04/2019 08:00:00" "25/04/2019 21:30:00" "25/04/2019 22:00:00"
## [4] "25/04/2019 18:45:00" "25/04/2019 14:40:00" "25/04/2019 22:00:00"
## [7] "25/04/2019 16:00:00"

```

We assign it to a variable:

```
date_time_str <- c("26/04/2019 08:00:00",
 "25/04/2019 21:30:00",
 "25/04/2019 22:00:00",
 "25/04/2019 18:45:00",
 "25/04/2019 14:40:00",
 "25/04/2019 22:00:00",
 "25/04/2019 16:00:00")

```

We use the **`dmy_hms()`** function from **`lubridate`** to convert each element of our vector into **`POSIXct`** objects. Since we’re in Sydney, Australia, we’ll assign each the ‘Australia/Sydney’ time zone:

```
library(lubridate)
date_time_values <- dmy_hms(date_time_str, tz='Australia/Sydney')
print(date_time_values)

```

```
## [1] "2019-04-26 08:00:00 AEST" "2019-04-25 21:30:00 AEST"
## [3] "2019-04-25 22:00:00 AEST" "2019-04-25 18:45:00 AEST"
## [5] "2019-04-25 14:40:00 AEST" "2019-04-25 22:00:00 AEST"
## [7] "2019-04-25 16:00:00 AEST" 

```

Hooray!

We’ll end with this:

> 
“Bloody brilliant!”
