From the recent developer.r-project.org “Staged Install” article:

> 

Incidentally, there were just two distinct (very long) lists of methods in the warnings across all installed packages in my run, but repeated for many packages. It turned out that they were lists of exported methods from dplyr and rlang packages. These two packages take very long to install due to C++ code compilation.



Technical point.

While `dplyr` indeed uses `C++` (via `Rcpp`), `rlang` appears to currently be a `C`-package. So any problems associated with `rlang` are probably not due to `C++` or `Rcpp`. Similarly other tidyverse packages such as `purrr` and `tibble` are currently `C` packages. I think `purrr` once used `C++`, but do not know about the others.
