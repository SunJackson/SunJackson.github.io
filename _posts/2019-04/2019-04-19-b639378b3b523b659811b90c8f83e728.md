A new version 0.1.2 of the tint package is arriving at CRAN as I write this. It follows the recent 0.1.1 release which included two fabulous new vignettes featuring new font choices. The package name expands from *tint is not tufte* as the package offers a fresher take on the Tufte-style for html and pdf presentations.

However, with the new vignettes in 0.1.1 we now had four full-length vignettes which made the package somewhat bulky. So for this release I reorganized things a little, added two new shorter vignettes *with links to the full-length vignettes* but keeping the size more constrained.

Two screenshots for the first pages of the Lato and Garamond vignettes follow (and are links to a higher-resolution full-length pdf versions):

The new vignettes can also be browsed from CRAN: html variant and pdf variant. They also show the new theme borrowed with thanks and credits from ggtufte.

The full list of changes is below.

Changes in tint version 0.1.2 (2019-04-19)


Two new shorter html and pdf vignettes have been added (with references to the longer vignettes) reducing package size.


New helper function ‘theme_tint’ based on a similar function in package ‘ggtufte’.




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a comparison to the previous release. More information is on the tint page.
