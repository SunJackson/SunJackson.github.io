**RLgraph** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Reinforcement learning (RL) tasks are challenging to implement, execute and test due to algorithmic instability, hyper-parameter sensitivity, and heterogeneous distributed communication patterns. We argue for the separation of logical component composition, backend graph definition, and distributed execution. To this end, we introduce RLgraph, a library for designing and executing high performance RL computation graphs in both static graph and define-by-run paradigms. The resulting implementations yield high performance across different deep learning frameworks and distributed backends. … 

**Model-Augmented Neural neTwork with Incoherent k-space Sampling (MANTIS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Quantitative mapping of magnetic resonance (MR) parameters have been shown as valuable methods for improved assessment of a range of diseases. Due to the need to image an anatomic structure multiple times, parameter mapping usually requires long scan times compared to conventional static imaging. Therefore, accelerated parameter mapping is highly-desirable and remains a topic of great interest in the MR research community. While many recent deep learning methods have focused on highly efficient image reconstruction for conventional static MR imaging, applications of deep learning for dynamic imaging and in particular accelerated parameter mapping have been limited. The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a novel deep learning-based reconstruction framework called Model-Augmented Neural neTwork with Incoherent k-space Sampling (MANTIS) for efficient MR parameter mapping. Our approach combines end-to-end CNN mapping with k-space consistency using the concept of cyclic loss to further enforce data and model fidelity. Incoherent k-space sampling is used to improve reconstruction performance. A physical model is incorporated into the proposed framework, so that the parameter maps can be efficiently estimated directly from undersampled images. The performance of MANTIS was demonstrated for the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) mapping of the knee joint. Compared to conventional reconstruction approaches that exploited image sparsity, MANTIS yielded lower errors and higher similarity with respect to the reference in the T2 estimation. Our study demonstrated that the proposed MANTIS framework, with a combination of end-to-end CNN mapping, signal model-augmented data consistency, and incoherent k-space sampling, represents a promising approach for efficient MR parameter mapping. MANTIS can potentially be extended to other types of parameter mapping with appropriate models. … 

**StocHy** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
StocHy is a software tool for the quantitative analysis of discrete-time stochastic hybrid systems (SHS). StocHy accepts a high-level description of stochastic models and constructs an equivalent SHS model. The tool allows to (i) simulate the SHS evolution over a given time horizon; and to automatically construct formal abstractions of the SHS. Abstractions are then employed for (ii) formal verification or (iii) control (policy, strategy) synthesis. StocHy allows for modular modelling, and has separate simulation, verification and synthesis engines, which are implemented as independent libraries. This allows for libraries to be easily used and for extensions to be easily built. The tool is implemented in C++ and employs manipulations based on vector calculus, the use of sparse matrices, the symbolic construction of probabilistic kernels, and multi-threading. Experiments show StocHy’s markedly improved performance when compared to existing abstraction-based approaches: in particular, StocHy beats state-of-the-art tools in terms of precision (abstraction error) and computational effort, and finally attains scalability to large-sized models (12 continuous dimensions). StocHy is available at http://www.gitlab.com/natchi92/StocHy. …
