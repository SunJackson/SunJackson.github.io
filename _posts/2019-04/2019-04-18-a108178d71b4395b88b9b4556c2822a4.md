In this post we are talking about one of the most unintuitive results of statistics: the so called *false positive paradox* which is an example of the so called *base rate fallacy*. It describes a situation where a positive test result of a very sensitive medical test shows that you have the respective diseaseâ€¦ yet you are most probably healthy!

The reason for this is that the disease itself is so rare that even with a very sensitive test the result is most probably *false positive*: it shows that you have the disease yet this result is false, you are healthy.

The key to understanding this result is to understand the difference between two conditional probabilities: the probability that you have a positive test result when you are sick and the probability that you are sick in case you got a positive test result â€“ you are interested in the last (am I really sick?) but you only know the first.

Now for some notation (the vertical dash means â€œunder the condition thatâ€�, P stands for probability):

) â€“ this is what we want to know

To calculate one conditional probability from the other we use the famous **Bayesâ€™ theorem**:

In the following example we assume a disease with an infection rate of *1* in *1000* and a test to detect this disease with a *sensitivity* of *99%*. Have a look at the following code which illustrates the situation with *Euler diagrams*, first the big picture, then a zoomed-in version:

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/euler1-1024x731.png?w=450)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/euler1-1024x731.png?w=450)


![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/euler2-1024x731.png?w=450)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/euler2-1024x731.png?w=450)


As you can see although this test is very sensitive when you get a positive test result the probability of you being infected is only *9%*!

In the diagrams *C* is the whole population and *A* are the infected individuals. *B* shows the people with a positive test result and you can see in the second diagram that almost all of the infected *A* are also part of *B* (the brown area = *true positive*), but still most ob *B* are outside of *A* (the green area), so although they are not infected they have a positive test result! They are *false positive*.

The red area shows the people that are infected (*A*) but get a negative test result, stating that they are healthy. This is called *false negative*. The grey area shows the people who are healthy and get a negative test result, they are *true negative*.

Due to the occasion we are now coming to an even more extreme example: did Jesus rise from the dead? It is inspired by the very good essay â€œA drop in the seaâ€�: Donâ€™t believe in miracles until youâ€™ve done the math.

Let us assume that we had very, very reliable witnesses (as a side note what is strange though is that the gospels cannot even agree on how many men or angels appeared at the tomb: it is one angel in Matthew, a young man in Mark, two men in Luke and two angels in Johnâ€¦ but anyway), yet the big problem is that not many people so far have been able to defy death. I have only heard of two cases: supposedly the King of Kings (Jesus) but also of course the King himself (Elvis!), whereby sightings of Elvis after his death are much more numerous than of Jesus (just sayingâ€¦ ![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 )

Have a look at the following code (source for the number of people who have ever lived: WolframAlpha)

So, in this case *C* is the unfortunate group of people who have to go for goodâ€¦ it is us. ![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f641.png?w=456&ssl=1)

 As you can see although the witnesses are super reliable when they claim that somebody rose it is almost certain that they are wrong:

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-009c7f4fb0730a73ec42fc94a707c115_l3.png?resize=69%2C18)

: if Jesus rose (![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-816b613a4f79d4bf9cb51396a9654120_l3.png?resize=13%2C12)

) the very, very reliable witnesses would with a very high probability say so (![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c74288aabc0e2ca280d25d92bf1a1ec2_l3.png?resize=14%2C12)

)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a4ec03e34633382a56e3b97ac165dae4_l3.png?resize=69%2C18)

: if the very, very reliable witnesses said that Jesus rose (![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c74288aabc0e2ca280d25d92bf1a1ec2_l3.png?resize=14%2C12)

) Jesus would still almost surely have stayed dead

Or in the words of the above mentioned essay:

> 
No one is justified in believing in Jesusâ€™s resurrection. The numbers simply donâ€™t justify the conclusion.


But this chimes well with a famous Christian saying â€œI believe because it is absurdâ€� (or in Latin â€œCredo quia absurdumâ€�) â€“ you can find out more about that in another highly interesting essay: â€˜I believe because it is absurdâ€™: Christianityâ€™s first meme

Unfortunately this devastating conclusion is also true in the case of Elvisâ€¦
