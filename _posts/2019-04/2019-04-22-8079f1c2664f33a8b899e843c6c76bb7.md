**OCKELM+: Kernel Extreme Learning Machine based One-class Classification using Privileged Information (or KOC+: Kernel Ridge Regression or Least Square SVM with zero bias based One-class Classification using Privileged Information)**

Kernel method-based one-class classifier is mainly used for outlier or novelty detection. In this letter, kernel ridge regression (KRR) based one-class classifier (KOC) has been extended for learning using privileged information (LUPI). LUPI-based KOC method is referred to as KOC+. This privileged information is available as a feature with the dataset but only for training (not for testing). KOC+ utilizes the privileged information differently compared to normal feature information by using a so-called correction function. Privileged information helps KOC+ in achieving better generalization performance which is exhibited in this letter by testing the classifiers with and without privileged information. Existing and proposed classifiers are evaluated on the datasets from UCI machine learning repository and also on MNIST dataset. Moreover, experimental results evince the advantage of KOC+ over KOC and support vector machine (SVM) based one-class classifiers.

**PL-NMF: Parallel Locality-Optimized Non-negative Matrix Factorization**

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a key kernel for unsupervised dimension reduction used in a wide range of applications, including topic modeling, recommender systems and bioinformatics. Due to the compute-intensive nature of applications that must perform repeated NMF, several parallel implementations have been developed in the past. However, existing parallel NMF algorithms have not addressed data locality optimizations, which are critical for high performance since data movement costs greatly exceed the cost of arithmetic/logic operations on current computer systems. In this paper, we devise a parallel NMF algorithm based on the HALS (Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares) scheme that incorporates algorithmic transformations to enhance data locality. Efficient realizations of the algorithm on multi-core CPUs and GPUs are developed, demonstrating significant performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art parallel NMF algorithms.

**A Systematic Study of Leveraging Subword Information for Learning Word Representations**

The use of subword-level information (e.g., characters, character n-grams, morphemes) has become ubiquitous in modern word representation learning. Its importance is attested especially for morphologically rich languages which generate a large number of rare words. Despite a steadily increasing interest in such subword-informed word representations, their systematic comparative analysis across typologically diverse languages and different tasks is still missing. In this work, we deliver such a study focusing on the variation of two crucial components required for subword-level integration into word representation models: 1) segmentation of words into subword units, and 2) subword composition functions to obtain final word representations. We propose a general framework for learning subword-informed word representations that allows for easy experimentation with different segmentation and composition components, also including more advanced techniques based on position embeddings and self-attention. Using the unified framework, we run experiments over a large number of subword-informed word representation configurations (60 in total) on 3 tasks (general and rare word similarity, dependency parsing, fine-grained entity typing) for 5 languages representing 3 language types. Our main results clearly indicate that there is no ‘one-sizefits-all’ configuration, as performance is both language- and task-dependent. We also show that configurations based on unsupervised segmentation (e.g., BPE, Morfessor) are sometimes comparable to or even outperform the ones based on supervised word segmentation.

**SynC: A Unified Framework for Generating Synthetic Population with Gaussian Copula**

Synthetic population generation is the process of combining multiple socioeonomic and demographic datasets from various sources and at different granularity, and downscaling them to an individual level. Although it is a fundamental step for many data science tasks, an efficient and standard framework is absent. In this study, we propose a multi-stage framework called SynC (Synthetic Population via Gaussian Copula) to fill the gap. SynC first removes potential outliers in the data and then fits the filtered data with a Gaussian copula model to correctly capture dependencies and marginal distributions of sampled survey data. Finally, SynC leverages neural networks to merge datasets into one and then scales them accordingly to match the marginal constraints. We make four key contributions in this work: 1) propose a novel framework for generating individual level data from aggregated data sources by combining state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical techniques, 2) design a metric for validating the accuracy of generated data when the ground truth is hard to obtain, 3) demonstrate its effectiveness with the Canada National Census data and presenting two real-world use cases where datasets of this nature can be leveraged by businesses, and 4) release an easy-to-use framework implementation for reproducibility.

**Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Recurrent Graph Neural Networks**

In this paper, we study the problem of node representation learning with graph neural networks. We present a graph neural network class named recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), that address the shortcomings of prior methods. By using recurrent units to capture the long-term dependency across layers, our methods can successfully identify important information during recursive neighborhood expansion. In our experiments, we show that our model class achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks: the Pubmed, Reddit, and PPI network datasets. Our in-depth analyses also demonstrate that incorporating recurrent units is a simple yet effective method to prevent noisy information in graphs, which enables a deeper graph neural network.

**A Multi-Task Learning Framework for Overcoming the Catastrophic Forgetting in Automatic Speech Recognition**

Recently, data-driven based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved state-of-the-art results. And transfer learning is often used when those existing systems are adapted to the target domain, e.g., fine-tuning, retraining. However, in the processes, the system parameters may well deviate too much from the previously learned parameters. Thus, it is difficult for the system training process to learn knowledge from target domains meanwhile not forgetting knowledge from the previous learning process, which is called as catastrophic forgetting (CF). In this paper, we attempt to solve the CF problem with the lifelong learning and propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) training framework for ASR. It considers reserving original knowledge and learning new knowledge as two independent tasks, respectively. On the one hand, we constrain the new parameters not to deviate too far from the original parameters and punish the new system when forgetting original knowledge. On the other hand, we force the new system to solve new knowledge quickly. Then, a MTL mechanism is employed to get the balance between the two tasks. We applied our method to an End2End ASR task and obtained the best performance in both target and original datasets.

**Forecasting with time series imaging**

Feature-based time series representation has attracted substantial attention in a wide range of time series analysis methods. Recently, the use of time series features for forecast model selection and model averaging has been an emerging research focus in the forecasting community. Nonetheless, most of the existing approaches depend on the manual choice of an appropriate set of features. Exploiting machine learning methods to automatically extract features from time series becomes crucially important in the state-of-the-art time series analysis. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to extract time series features based on images. Time series are first transformed into recurrence images, from which local features can be extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted features are used for forecast model selection and model averaging. Our experiments show that forecasting based on automatically extracted features, with less human intervention and a more comprehensive view of the raw time series data, yields comparable performances with the top best methods proposed in the largest forecasting competition M4.

**Text Classification Algorithms: A Survey**

In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the number of complex documents and texts that require a deeper understanding of machine learning methods to be able to accurately classify texts in many applications. Many machine learning approaches have achieved surpassing results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their capacity to understand complex models and non-linear relationships within data. However, finding suitable structures, architectures, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, a brief overview of text classification algorithms is discussed. This overview covers different text feature extractions, dimensionality reduction methods, existing algorithms and techniques, and evaluations methods. Finally, the limitations of each technique and their application in the real-world problem are discussed.

**Self-Attention Graph Pooling**

Advanced methods of applying deep learning to structured data such as graphs have been proposed in recent years. In particular, studies have focused on generalizing convolutional neural networks to graph data, which includes redefining the convolution and the downsampling (pooling) operations for graphs. The method of generalizing the convolution operation to graphs has been proven to improve performance and is widely used. However, the method of applying downsampling to graphs is still difficult to perform and has room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph pooling method based on self-attention. Self-attention using graph convolution allows our pooling method to consider both node features and graph topology. To ensure a fair comparison, the same training procedures and model architectures were used for the existing pooling methods and our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior graph classification performance on the benchmark datasets using a reasonable number of parameters.

**General Purpose (GenP) Bioimage Ensemble of Handcrafted and Learned Features with Data Augmentation**

Bioimage classification plays a crucial role in many biological problems. Here we present a new General Purpose (GenP) ensemble that boosts performance by combining local features, dense sampling features, and deep learning approaches. We propose an ensemble of deep learning methods built using different criteria (different batch sizes, learning rates, topologies, and data augmentation methods). One of the contributions of this paper is the proposal of new methods of data augmentation based on feature transforms (principal component analysis/discrete cosine transform) that boost performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Each handcrafted descriptor is used to train a different Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the different SVMs are combined with the ensemble of CNNs. Our method is evaluated on a diverse set of bioimage classification problems. Results demonstrate that the proposed GenP bioimage ensemble obtains state-of-the-art performance without any ad-hoc dataset tuning of parameters (avoiding the risk of overfitting/overtraining).

**Patent Analytics Based on Feature Vector Space Model: A Case of IoT**

The number of approved patents worldwide increases rapidly each year, which requires new patent analytics to efficiently mine the valuable information attached to these patents. Vector space model (VSM) represents documents as high-dimensional vectors, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term. While originally proposed for information retrieval systems, VSM has also seen wide applications in patent analytics, and used as a fundamental tool to map patent documents to structured data. However, VSM method suffers from several limitations when applied to patent analysis tasks, such as loss of sentence-level semantics and curse-of-dimensionality problems. In order to address the above limitations, we propose a patent analytics based on feature vector space model (FVSM), where the FVSM is constructed by mapping patent documents to feature vectors extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNN). The applications of FVSM for three typical patent analysis tasks, i.e., patents similarity comparison, patent clustering, and patent map generation are discussed. A case study using patents related to Internet of Things (IoT) technology is illustrated to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of FVSM. The proposed FVSM can be adopted by other patent analysis studies to replace VSM, based on which various big data learning tasks can be performed.

**Explainability in Human-Agent Systems**

This paper presents a taxonomy of explainability in Human-Agent Systems. We consider fundamental questions about the Why, Who, What, When and How of explainability. First, we define explainability, and its relationship to the related terms of interpretability, transparency, explicitness, and faithfulness. These definitions allow us to answer why explainability is needed in the system, whom it is geared to and what explanations can be generated to meet this need. We then consider when the user should be presented with this information. Last, we consider how objective and subjective measures can be used to evaluate the entire system. This last question is the most encompassing as it will need to evaluate all other issues regarding explainability.

**Audio-Text Sentiment Analysis using Deep Robust Complementary Fusion of Multi-Features and Multi-Modalities**

Sentiment analysis research has been rapidly developing in the last decade and has attracted widespread attention from academia and industry, most of which is based on text. However, the information in the real world usually comes as different modalities. In this paper, we consider the task of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, using Audio and Text Modalities, proposed a novel fusion strategy including Multi-Feature Fusion and Multi-Modality Fusion to improve the accuracy of Audio-Text Sentiment Analysis. We call this the Deep Feature Fusion-Audio and Text Modal Fusion (DFF-ATMF) model, and the features learned from it are complementary to each other and robust. Experiments with the CMU-MOSI corpus and the recently released CMU-MOSEI corpus for Youtube video sentiment analysis show the very competitive results of our proposed model. Surprisingly, our method also achieved the state-of-the-art results in the IEMOCAP dataset, indicating that our proposed fusion strategy is also extremely generalization ability to Multimodal Emotion Recognition.

**Understanding the Signature of Controversial Wikipedia Articles through Motifs in Editor Revision Networks**

Wikipedia serves as a good example of how editors collaborate to form and maintain an article. The relationship between editors, derived from their sequence of editing activity, results in a directed network structure called the revision network, that potentially holds valuable insights into editing activity. In this paper we create revision networks to assess differences between controversial and non-controversial articles, as labelled by Wikipedia. Originating from complex networks, we apply motif analysis, which determines the under or over-representation of induced sub-structures, in this case triads of editors. We analyse 21,631 Wikipedia articles in this way, and use principal component analysis to consider the relationship between their motif subgraph ratio profiles. Results show that a small number of induced triads play an important role in characterising relationships between editors, with controversial articles having a tendency to cluster. This provides useful insight into editing behaviour and interaction capturing counter-narratives, without recourse to semantic analysis. It also provides a potentially useful feature for future prediction of controversial Wikipedia articles.

**Compositional Network Embedding**

Network embedding has proved extremely useful in a variety of network analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Almost all the existing network embedding methods learn to map the node IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This design principle, however, hinders the existing methods from being applied in real cases. Node ID is not generalizable and, thus, the existing methods have to pay great effort in cold-start problem. The heterogeneous network usually requires extra work to encode node types, as node type is not able to be identified by node ID. Node ID carries rare information, resulting in the criticism that the existing methods are not robust to noise. To address this issue, we introduce Compositional Network Embedding, a general inductive network representation learning framework that generates node embeddings by combining node features based on the principle of compositionally. Instead of directly optimizing an embedding lookup based on arbitrary node IDs, we learn a composition function that infers node embeddings by combining the corresponding node attribute embeddings through a graph-based loss. For evaluation, we conduct the experiments on link prediction under four different settings. The results verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of compositional network embeddings, especially on unseen nodes.

**Analysing Neural Network Topologies: a Game Theoretic Approach**

Artificial Neural Networks have shown impressive success in very different application cases. Choosing a proper network architecture is a critical decision for a network’s success, usually done in a manual manner. As a straightforward strategy, large, mostly fully connected architectures are selected, thereby relying on a good optimization strategy to find proper weights while at the same time avoiding overfitting. However, large parts of the final network are redundant. In the best case, large parts of the network become simply irrelevant for later inferencing. In the worst case, highly parameterized architectures hinder proper optimization and allow the easy creation of adverserial examples fooling the network. A first step in removing irrelevant architectural parts lies in identifying those parts, which requires measuring the contribution of individual components such as neurons. In previous work, heuristics based on using the weight distribution of a neuron as contribution measure have shown some success, but do not provide a proper theoretical understanding. Therefore, in our work we investigate game theoretic measures, namely the Shapley value (SV), in order to separate relevant from irrelevant parts of an artificial neural network. We begin by designing a coalitional game for an artificial neural network, where neurons form coalitions and the average contributions of neurons to coalitions yield to the Shapley value. In order to measure how well the Shapley value measures the contribution of individual neurons, we remove low-contributing neurons and measure its impact on the network performance. In our experiments we show that the Shapley value outperforms other heuristics for measuring the contribution of neurons.

**CaseNet: Content-Adaptive Scale Interaction Networks for Scene Parsing**

Objects in an image exhibit diverse scales. Adaptive receptive fields are expected to catch suitable range of context for accurate pixel level semantic prediction for handling objects of diverse sizes. Recently, atrous convolution with different dilation rates has been used to generate features of multi-scales through several branches and these features are fused for prediction. However, there is a lack of explicit interaction among the branches to adaptively make full use of the contexts. In this paper, we propose a Content-Adaptive Scale Interaction Network (CaseNet) to exploit the multi-scale features for scene parsing. We build the CaseNet based on the classic Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module, followed by the proposed contextual scale interaction (CSI) module, and the scale adaptation (SA) module. Specifically, first, for each spatial position, we enable context interaction among different scales through scale-aware non-local operations across the scales, \ie, CSI module, which facilitates the generation of flexible mixed receptive fields, instead of a traditional flat one. Second, the scale adaptation module (SA) explicitly and softly selects the suitable scale for each spatial position and each channel. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on three scene parsing benchmarks Cityscapes, ADE20K and LIP.

**Guided Anisotropic Diffusion and Iterative Learning for Weakly Supervised Change Detection**

Large scale datasets created from user labels or openly available data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised learning techniques. In this paper we propose an iterative learning method that extracts the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data to train a fully convolutional network which surpasses the performance obtained by naive supervised learning. We also propose the guided anisotropic diffusion algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering, and is used in conjunction with the iterative training method to improve results.

**Indirect Inference for Time Series Using the Empirical Characteristic Function and Control Variates**

We estimate the parameter of a time series process by minimizing the integrated weighted mean squared error between the empirical and simulated characteristic function, when the true characteristic functions cannot be explicitly computed. Motivated by Indirect Inference, we use a Monte Carlo approximation of the characteristic function based on iid simulated blocks. As a classical variance reduction technique, we propose the use of control variates for reducing the variance of this Monte Carlo approximation. These two approximations yield two new estimators that are applicable to a large class of time series processes. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of the parameter estimators under strong mixing, moment conditions, and smoothness of the simulated blocks with respect to its parameter. In a simulation study we show the good performance of these new simulation based estimators, and the superiority of the control variates based estimator for Poisson driven time series of counts.

**Interpreting Adversarial Examples with Attributes**

Deep computer vision systems being vulnerable to imperceptible and carefully crafted noise have raised questions regarding the robustness of their decisions. We take a step back and approach this problem from an orthogonal direction. We propose to enable black-box neural networks to justify their reasoning both for clean and for adversarial examples by leveraging attributes, i.e. visually discriminative properties of objects. We rank attributes based on their class relevance, i.e. how the classification decision changes when the input is visually slightly perturbed, as well as image relevance, i.e. how well the attributes can be localized on both clean and perturbed images. We present comprehensive experiments for attribute prediction, adversarial example generation, adversarially robust learning, and their qualitative and quantitative analysis using predicted attributes on three benchmark datasets.
