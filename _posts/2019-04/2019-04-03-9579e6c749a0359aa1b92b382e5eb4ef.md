With thousands of powerful packages, it’s easy to glaze over the libraries that come preinstalled with R. Thus, this post will talk about some of the cool functions in the **utils** package, which comes with a standard installation of R. While **utils** comes with several familiar functions, like *read.csv*, *write.csv*, and *help*, it also contains over 200 other functions.

## **readClipboard and writeClipboard**

One of my favorite duo of functions from **utils** is *readCLipboard* and *writeClipboard*. If you’re doing some manipulation to get a quick answer between R and Excel, these functions can come in handy. *readClipboard* reads in whatever is currently on the Clipboard.

For example, let’s copy a column of cells from Excel.

We can now run *readClipboard()* in R. The result of running this command is a vector containing the column of cells we just copied. Each cell corresponds to an element in the vector.

Similarly, if we want to write a vector of elements to the clipboard, we can the *writeClipboard* command:

Now, the vector **test** has been copied to the clipboard. If you paste the result in Excel, you’ll see a column of cells corresponding to the vector you just copied.

## **combn**

The *combn* function is useful for getting the possible combinations of an input vector. For instance, let’s say we want to get all of the possible 2-element combinations of a vector, we could do this:

![](https://i1.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/combn-get-all-combinations-of-a-vector-in-r.png?w=640)


In general, the first parameter of *combn* is the vector of elements you want to get possible combinations from. The second parameter is the number of elements you want in each combination. So if you need to get all possible 3-element or 4-element combinations, you would just need to change this number to three or four.

We can also add a parameter called **simplify** to make the function return a list of each combination, rather than giving back a matrix output like above.

## **fileSnapshot**

The *fileSnapshot* function is one R’s collection of file manipulation functions. To learn more about file manipulation and getting information on files in R, check out this post.

*fileSnapshot* will list and provide details about the files in a directory. This function returns a list of objects.

fileSnapshot returns a list, which here we will just call “snapshot”. The most useful piece of information can be garnered from this by referencing “info”:

Here, snapshot$info is a data frame showing information about the files in the input folder parameter. Its headers include:

## **download.file**

*download.file* does just what it sounds like – downloads a file from the internet to the destination provided in the function’s input. The first parameter is the URL of the file you wish to download. The second parameter is the name you want to give to the downloaded file. Below, we download a file and call it “census_data.csv”.

## **How to modify an object on the fly with the “fix” function**

The **utils** package also has the ability to modify objects on the fly with the *fix* function. For instance, let’s say you define a function interactively, and you want to make some modification.

Now, let’s modify the function with *fix*:

![](https://i2.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fix-function-in-r.png?w=640)


When you call *fix*, it comes up with an editor allowing you to modify the definition of the function. You can also call *fix* to modify a vector or data frame.
