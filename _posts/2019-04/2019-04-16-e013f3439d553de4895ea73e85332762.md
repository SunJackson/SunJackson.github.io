## Cross-industry sessions for decision makers and technical builders

**Precision medicine for healthier lives***Keith Bigelow, GM of Analytics, GE Healthcare*

GE Healthcare has developed machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker to track and predict brain devel­opment in a growing fetus. Powered by these models, the new offering SonoCNS drives the placement of the probe to evaluate congenital and neurological issues in the fetus, for example, to accurately measure and understand brain volume growth. Using Amazon SageMaker for machine learning, GE Healthcare’s operators can quickly detect abnormalities, helping to save babies’ lives and give parents peace of mind. For hospitals, this also translates to improved productivity, efficiency, and accuracy.

**Intelligent identity and access management***Paul Hurlocker, Vice President, Center for Machine Learning, Capital One*

As one of the largest banks in the U.S., Capital One prioritizes a responsible and well-managed data environment and ecosystem. To meet these needs, Capital One has combined machine learning and native AWS graph capabilities to build a platform that proactively informs access levels for individual associates and teams. The platform results in a faster, enhanced on-boarding process, workflow, and productivity for associates, and helps mitigate risk through proactive management of privileges and licenses.

**A hype-free and cutting-edge discussion on autonomous driving***Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Associate Professor, University of Michigan*

How close are we to fully autonomous vehicles? What would happen if we put the current technology on the road today? What are the problems that still need to be solved? This session will cover the latest advances in self-driving cars without the marketing, providing a true picture of how far we are from never touching a steering wheel again.

**How TED uses AI to spread ideas farther and faster***Jenny Zurawell, Director, & Helena Batt, Deputy Director, TED Translators*

TED Talks are a powerful way to share ideas and spark dialogue. To make TED content accessible, volunteer trans­lators need to subtitle more than 300,000 minutes of video this year alone. See how TED leverages Amazon Tran­scribe and Amazon Translate to speed up the creation of crowdsourced subtitles, expand the online reach of ideas, and transform subtitle production in media.

**From seed to store: Using AI to optimize the indoor farms of the future***Irving Fain, Co-founder and CEO, Bowery Farms*

For the last 10,000 years, large-scale agriculture has lived outdoors, optimized to withstand unpredictable environ­mental conditions and long supply chains. But what possibilities do you unlock when you can control every single environmental factor, from the light intensity to nutrient mix to air flow? In this talk, learn how Bowery Farms uses machine learning and computer vision to optimize indoor vertical farms and scale agricultural production to create higher yielding, better tasting, safer, and more sustainable locally-grown produce in cities around the world.

**Futuring the farm to improve crop health***Peri Subrahmanya, IoT Product Manager, & Craig Williams, Principal Solution Architect, Bayer Crop Science*

One third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted before it is consumed, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This equals a loss of $750 billion annually. With AWS IoT, Bayer Crop Sci­ence can prevent process loss in real time and use real-time data collection and analysis for its global seed business, collecting an average of one million traits per day during planting or harvest season.

**AI, spatial understanding, robots, and the smart home***Chris Jones, Chief Technology Officer, iRobot*

Consumers increasingly expect connected products in their home to deliver easy-to-use and personalized experiences tailored to their home and activity. To deliver such a personalized experience, the smart home needs to intelligently coordinate diverse connected devices located throughout the home.

**Creating the intelligent asset: Fusing IoT, robotics, and AI***Jason Crusan, Vice President of Technology, Woodside Energy*

What if you could learn more about your facility from your tablet than by walking around it yourself? Through 4D interactive virtual worlds, Woodside’s “Intelligent Asset” offers an immersive experience in which operators can explore their facility remotely in real time. Learn how Woodside, the leading energy provider in Australia, combined the latest AWS services including Amazon Kinesis Video Streams, Amazon SageMaker, AWS RoboMaker, and AWS IoT.

**Distributed AI: Alexa living on the edge***Ariya Rastrow, Principal Applied Scientist, Alexa Speech*

Distributed edge learning, which leverages on-device computation for training models and centrally aggregated an­onymized updates, is a promising new approach capable of achieving customer-level personalization at scale while addressing privacy and trust concerns. Practitioners, employers, and users of AI should understand this new edge-first paradigm and how it will impact the discipline in the near future.

**Applying space-based data and machine learning to the UN’s sustainability goals***Dr. Shay Har-Noy, Vice President, Maxar Technologies*

The United Nations has outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals that address global challenges such as poverty, hunger, and health. While the goals are focused on life on Earth, space-based data and machine learning are yield­ing insights. Learn how a combination of analytics and satellite imagery are helping solve pressing problems.

**Enabling sustainable human life in space using AI***Dr. Natalie Rens, CEO & Founder, Astreia*

Human settlement of space will pose one of the grandest challenges in history. We imagine entire communities living on the moon and beyond without depending on constant supervision or support from Earth. We’ll discuss the challenges for sustainable life in space, and our plan to use artificial intelligence to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our first space settlers.
