Data Science and Analytics is a very hot field, and demand for data scientists is still growing strongly. Many universities stepped in and created many degrees in the field, primarily Masters degrees.

Back in 2017, we ran a series of articles looking at the best of these degrees in America, Europe and Online. Luckily for you, we’ve now updated these comprehensive lists and added lots more masters programs. The first of these lists has already been published - **2019 Best Masters in Data Science and Analytics - Europe**. In this post, we'll be concentrating on Online masters programs.

CS Rank is Top Universities Computer and Information Systems graduate programs rank for ranks 1-50. They provide individual CS rankings for top 50 schools, and then ranges (51-100, 101-150, etc) for the next 450 schools. To separate schools that have the same range of rankings, we added the Top Universities ranking for the divided by 10 to the start of the range. Of course, this ranking isn’t 100% scientific in how it is calculated, but it does give a good idea of the schools that offer these courses.

We’ve included information from the 2017 version to give you an idea on how the schools have changed in the last couple of years. As always, please let us know in the comments section below if we’ve missed any out and we’ll update the table accordingly.
