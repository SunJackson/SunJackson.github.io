This embedded structure allows students to earn a graduate certificate while in pursuit of their master’s degree.

Students can customize their program further by selecting elective courses that are most appropriate for their unique career goals. Elective topics include data visualization, deep learning, network and predictive analytics, advanced database design, large-scale databases for real-world analytics, regression methods, technical project management, and more.
