This paper describes the discipline of distance metric learning, a branch of machine learning that aims to learn distances from the data. Distance metric learning can be useful to improve similarity learning algorithms, and also has applications in dimensionality reduction. We describe the distance metric learning problem and analyze its main mathematical foundations. We discuss some of the most popular distance metric learning techniques used in classification, showing their goals and the required information to understand and use them. Furthermore, we present a Python package that collects a set of 17 distance metric learning techniques explained in this paper, with some experiments to evaluate the performance of the different algorithms. Finally, we discuss several possibilities of future work in this topic. A Tutorial on Distance Metric Learning: Mathematical Foundations, Algorithms and Software
