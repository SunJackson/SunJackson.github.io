Getting your first role as a data scientist is tough, that's why we created S2DS, a 5-week data science bootcamp helping analytical PhDs transition from academia to industry. Participants work in teams on a real data science project for established companies such as Barclays, Ted Baker, KPMG, hot startups, and many more, learning how to use data science technologies and skills in a commercial environment and receive mentorship from the business and our internal team throughout.

The projects set you apart from the competition when it comes to an employer reviewing your CV and gives you something impressive and tangible to discuss at interview. The communication skills and business acumen you will acquire are essential skills for communicating to stakeholders and non-technical personnel.

We run several networking events with practising data scientists, and regular social events throughout the bootcamp's duration. Upon graduation, we host a celebratory dinner, and you will be inducted into our ever-growing community of S2DS alumni, a network of hundreds of practising data scientists.

We support our community by running Meetups, Hackathons, and an annual reunion, plus we recommend you paid data science projects based on your interests and skillset.

You don't need to worry about finding a place to stay, as we provide free accommodation for the entire duration on our London campus, minutes away from Northwick Park station, so you can explore the delights of the capital during the evenings and weekends.

We celebrate diversity, with alumni from over 60 countries and more than 40% participation by women.

Now in our 6th year, we've helped launch the careers of hundreds of data scientists. You can read what they've said about the course and their experiences here.

We run a Virtual version of the programme twice a year (March & October), open to PhDs and MScs, which you can find out more about here.

We are also giving away £100 for every successful applicant referred.

Applications close 22nd April 2019. Apply now and become a data scientist today.
