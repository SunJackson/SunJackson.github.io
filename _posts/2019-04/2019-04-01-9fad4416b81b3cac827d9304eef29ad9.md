Mobile Performance Enforcement: Machine Learning to Detect App Performance Regressions at Uber

In today’s digital age, users expect a fast, reliable mobile experience. Degradations (also referred to as regressions) in mobile app performance affect not only user experience, but even hurt business metrics. However, existing mobile app release pipelines lack the necessary infrastructure to detect regressions in a mobile app's performance before it is rolled out to the world. At Uber, we are building a state-of-the-art mobile regression detection pipeline, with the goal to detect regressions as small as 1%. Our approach includes both technological innovations as well as employing machine learning along with statistical testing techniques to improve the sensitivity of the regression experiments.
