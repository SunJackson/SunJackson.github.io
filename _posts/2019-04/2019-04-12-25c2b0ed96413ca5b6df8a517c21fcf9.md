**WeNet: Weighted Networks for Recurrent Network Architecture Search**

In recent years, there has been increasing demand for automatic architecture search in deep learning. Numerous approaches have been proposed and led to state-of-the-art results in various applications, including image classification and language modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel way of architecture search by means of weighted networks (WeNet), which consist of a number of networks, with each assigned a weight. These weights are updated with back-propagation to reflect the importance of different networks. Such weighted networks bear similarity to mixture of experts. We conduct experiments on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. We show that the proposed WeNet can find recurrent architectures which result in state-of-the-art performance.

**Application of data compression techniques to time series forecasting**

In this study we show that standard well-known file compression programs (zlib, bzip2, etc.) are able to forecast real-world time series data well. The strength of our approach is its ability to use a set of data compression algorithms and ‘automatically’ choose the best one of them during the process of forecasting. Besides, modern data-compressors are able to find many kinds of latent regularities using some methods of artificial intelligence (for example, some data-compressors are based on finding the smallest formal grammar that describes the time series). Thus, our approach makes it possible to apply some particular methods of artificial intelligence for time-series forecasting. As examples of the application of the proposed method, we made forecasts for the monthly T-index and the Kp-index time series using standard compressors. In both cases, we used the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an accuracy measure. For the monthly T-index time series, we made 18 forecasts beyond the available data for each month since January 2011 to July 2017. We show that, in comparison with the forecasts made by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, our method more accurately predicts one value ahead. The Kp-index time series consists of 3-hour values ranging from 0 to 9. For each day from February 4, 2018 to March 28, 2018, we made forecasts for 24 values ahead. We compared our forecasts with the forecasts made by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The results showed that the accuracy of our method is similar to the accuracy of the SWPC’s method. As in the previous case, we also obtained more accurate one-step forecasts.

**Decomposition-Based Transfer Distance Metric Learning for Image Classification**

Distance metric learning (DML) is a critical factor for image analysis and pattern recognition. To learn a robust distance metric for a target task, we need abundant side information (i.e., the similarity/dissimilarity pairwise constraints over the labeled data), which is usually unavailable in practice due to the high labeling cost. This paper considers the transfer learning setting by exploiting the large quantity of side information from certain related, but different source tasks to help with target metric learning (with only a little side information). The state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms usually fail in this setting because the data distributions of the source task and target task are often quite different. We address this problem by assuming that the target distance metric lies in the space spanned by the eigenvectors of the source metrics (or other randomly generated bases). The target metric is represented as a combination of the base metrics, which are computed using the decomposed components of the source metrics (or simply a set of random bases); we call the proposed method, decomposition-based transfer DML (DTDML). In particular, DTDML learns a sparse combination of the base metrics to construct the target metric by forcing the target metric to be close to an integration of the source metrics. The main advantage of the proposed method compared with existing transfer metric learning approaches is that we directly learn the base metric coefficients instead of the target metric. To this end, far fewer variables need to be learned. We therefore obtain more reliable solutions given the limited side information and the optimization tends to be faster. Experiments on the popular handwritten image (digit, letter) classification and challenge natural image annotation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Quantifying Interpretability of Arbitrary Machine Learning Models Through Functional Decomposition**

To obtain interpretable machine learning models, either interpretable models are constructed from the outset – e.g. shallow decision trees, rule lists, or sparse generalized linear models – or post-hoc interpretation methods – e.g. partial dependence or ALE plots – are employed. Both approaches have disadvantages. While the former can restrict the hypothesis space too conservatively, leading to potentially suboptimal solutions, the latter can produce too verbose or misleading results if the resulting model is too complex, especially w.r.t. feature interactions. We propose to make the compromise between predictive power and interpretability explicit by quantifying the complexity / interpretability of machine learning models. Based on functional decomposition, we propose measures of number of features used, interaction strength and main effect complexity. We show that post-hoc interpretation of models that minimize the three measures becomes more reliable and compact. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of such measures in a multi-objective optimization approach which considers predictive power and interpretability at the same time.

**Eliciting New Wikipedia Users’ Interests via Automatically Mined Questionnaires: For a Warm Welcome, Not a Cold Start**

Every day, thousands of users sign up as new Wikipedia contributors. Once joined, these users have to decide which articles to contribute to, which users to seek out and learn from or collaborate with, etc. Any such task is a hard and potentially frustrating one given the sheer size of Wikipedia. Supporting newcomers in their first steps by recommending articles they would enjoy editing or editors they would enjoy collaborating with is thus a promising route toward converting them into long-term contributors. Standard recommender systems, however, rely on users’ histories of previous interactions with the platform. As such, these systems cannot make high-quality recommendations to newcomers without any previous interactions — the so-called cold-start problem. The present paper addresses the cold-start problem on Wikipedia by developing a method for automatically building short questionnaires that, when completed by a newly registered Wikipedia user, can be used for a variety of purposes, including article recommendations that can help new editors get started. Our questionnaires are constructed based on the text of Wikipedia articles as well as the history of contributions by the already onboarded Wikipedia editors. We assess the quality of our questionnaire-based recommendations in an offline evaluation using historical data, as well as an online evaluation with hundreds of real Wikipedia newcomers, concluding that our method provides cohesive, human-readable questions that perform well against several baselines. By addressing the cold-start problem, this work can help with the sustainable growth and maintenance of Wikipedia’s diverse editor community.

**Multi-agent interaction in the problem of territorial distribution of production points and temporary storage facilities: the model’s construction and analysis**

This article discusses the algorithms for finding the optimal solution of problems related to the location of temporary storage of goods, warehouses, factories for processing raw materials and shops selling the final product in the transport network. An algorithm is also proposed for finding a compromise solution to the problem of maximizing profits for each agent.

**On Learning Density Aware Embeddings**

Deep metric learning algorithms have been utilized to learn discriminative and generalizable models which are effective for classifying unseen classes. In this paper, a novel noise tolerant deep metric learning algorithm is proposed. The proposed method, termed as Density Aware Metric Learning, enforces the model to learn embeddings that are pulled towards the most dense region of the clusters for each class. It is achieved by iteratively shifting the estimate of the center towards the dense region of the cluster thereby leading to faster convergence and higher generalizability. In addition to this, the approach is robust to noisy samples in the training data, often present as outliers. Detailed experiments and analysis on two challenging cross-modal face recognition databases and two popular object recognition databases exhibit the efficacy of the proposed approach. It has superior convergence, requires lesser training time, and yields better accuracies than several popular deep metric learning methods.

**Feature Learning Viewpoint of AdaBoost and a New Algorithm**

The AdaBoost algorithm has the superiority of resisting overfitting. Understanding the mysteries of this phenomena is a very fascinating fundamental theoretical problem. Many studies are devoted to explaining it from statistical view and margin theory. In this paper, we illustrate it from feature learning viewpoint, and propose the AdaBoost+SVM algorithm, which can explain the resistant to overfitting of AdaBoost directly and easily to understand. Firstly, we adopt the AdaBoost algorithm to learn the base classifiers. Then, instead of directly weighted combination the base classifiers, we regard them as features and input them to SVM classifier. With this, the new coefficient and bias can be obtained, which can be used to construct the final classifier. We explain the rationality of this and illustrate the theorem that when the dimension of these features increases, the performance of SVM would not be worse, which can explain the resistant to overfitting of AdaBoost.

**Kervolutional Neural Networks**

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled the state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, little effort has been devoted to establishing convolution in non-linear space. Existing works mainly leverage on the activation layers, which can only provide point-wise non-linearity. To solve this problem, a new operation, kervolution (kernel convolution), is introduced to approximate complex behaviors of human perception systems leveraging on the kernel trick. It generalizes convolution, enhances the model capacity, and captures higher order interactions of features, via patch-wise kernel functions, but without introducing additional parameters. Extensive experiments show that kervolutional neural networks (KNN) achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence than baseline CNN.

**Sampling, Intervention, Prediction, Aggregation: A Generalized Framework for Model Agnostic Interpretations**

Non-linear machine learning models often trade off a great predictive performance for a lack of interpretability. However, model agnostic interpretation techniques now allow us to estimate the effect and importance of features for any predictive model. Different notations and terminology have complicated their understanding and how they are related. A unified view on these methods has been missing. We present the generalized SIPA (Sampling, Intervention, Prediction, Aggregation) framework of work stages for model agnostic interpretation techniques and demonstrate how several prominent methods for feature effects can be embedded into the proposed framework. We also formally introduce pre-existing marginal effects to describe feature effects for black box models. Furthermore, we extend the framework to feature importance computations by pointing out how variance-based and performance-based importance measures are based on the same work stages. The generalized framework may serve as a guideline to conduct model agnostic interpretations in machine learning.

**Meta Filter Pruning to Accelerate Deep Convolutional Neural Networks**

Existing methods usually utilize pre-defined criterions, such as p-norm, to prune unimportant filters. There are two major limitations in these methods. First, the relations of the filters are largely ignored. The filters usually work jointly to make an accurate prediction in a collaborative way. Similar filters will have equivalent effects on the network prediction, and the redundant filters can be further pruned. Second, the pruning criterion remains unchanged during training. As the network updated at each iteration, the filter distribution also changes continuously. The pruning criterions should also be adaptively switched. In this paper, we propose Meta Filter Pruning (MFP) to solve the above problems. First, as a complement to the existing p-norm criterion, we introduce a new pruning criterion considering the filter relation via filter distance. Additionally, we build a meta pruning framework for filter pruning, so that our method could adaptively select the most appropriate pruning criterion as the filter distribution changes. Experiments validate our approach on two image classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our MFP reduces more than 50% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.44% top-5 accuracy loss.

**Bounded rational decision-making from elementary computations that reduce uncertainty**

In its most basic form, decision-making can be viewed as a computational process that progressively eliminates alternatives, thereby reducing uncertainty. Such processes are generally costly, meaning that the amount of uncertainty that can be reduced is limited by the amount of available computational resources. Here, we introduce the notion of elementary computation based on a fundamental principle for probability transfers that reduce uncertainty. Elementary computations can be considered as the inverse of Pigou-Dalton transfers applied to probability distributions, closely related to the concepts of majorization, T-transforms, and generalized entropies that induce a preorder on the space of probability distributions. As a consequence we can define resource cost functions that are order-preserving and therefore monotonic with respect to the uncertainty reduction. This leads to a comprehensive notion of decision-making processes with limited resources. Along the way, we prove several new results on majorization theory, as well as on entropy and divergence measures.

**CRAD: Clustering with Robust Autocuts and Depth**

We develop a new density-based clustering algorithm named CRAD which is based on a new neighbor searching function with a robust data depth as the dissimilarity measure. Our experiments prove that the new CRAD is highly competitive at detecting clusters with varying densities, compared with the existing algorithms such as DBSCAN, OPTICS and DBCA. Furthermore, a new effective parameter selection procedure is developed to select the optimal underlying parameter in the real-world clustering, when the ground truth is unknown. Lastly, we suggest a new clustering framework that extends CRAD from spatial data clustering to time series clustering without a-priori knowledge of the true number of clusters. The performance of CRAD is evaluated through extensive experimental studies.

**A Survey on Parallel Genetic Algorithms for Shop Scheduling Problems**

There have been extensive works dealing with genetic algorithms (GAs) for seeking optimal solutions of shop scheduling problems. Due to the NP hardness, the time cost is always heavy. With the development of high performance computing (HPC) in last decades, the interest has been focused on parallel GAs for shop scheduling problems. In this paper, we present the state of the art with respect to the recent works on solving shop scheduling problems using parallel GAs. It showcases the most representative publications in this field by the categorization of parallel GAs and analyzes their designs based on the frameworks.

**Nucleus Neural Network for Super Robust Learning**

Artificial neural networks which model the neurons and connecting architectures in brain have achieved great successes in many problems, especially those with deep layers. In this paper, we propose a nucleus neural network (NNN) and corresponding architecture and parameter learning methods. In a nucleus, there are no regular layers, i.e., a neuron may connect to all the neurons in the nucleus. This architecture gets rid of layer limitation and may lead to more powerful learning capability. It is crucial to determine the connections given numerous neurons. Based on the principle that more relevant input and output neuron pair deserves higher connecting density, we propose an architecture learning model for the nucleus. Moreover, we propose an improved learning method for learning connecting weights and biases with the optimized architecture. We find that this novel architecture is robust to irrelevant components in test data. So we define a super robust learning problem and test the proposed network with one case where the types of image backgrounds in training and test sets are different. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed learner achieves significant improvement over traditional learners on the reconstructed data set.

**Transferring Knowledge Fragments for Learning Distance Metric from A Heterogeneous Domain**

The goal of transfer learning is to improve the performance of target learning task by leveraging information (or transferring knowledge) from other related tasks. In this paper, we examine the problem of transfer distance metric learning (DML), which usually aims to mitigate the label information deficiency issue in the target DML. Most of the current Transfer DML (TDML) methods are not applicable to the scenario where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Some existing heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL) approaches can learn target distance metric by usually transforming the samples of source and target domain into a common subspace. However, these approaches lack flexibility in real-world applications, and the learned transformations are often restricted to be linear. This motivates us to develop a general flexible heterogeneous transfer distance metric learning (HTDML) framework. In particular, any (linear/nonlinear) DML algorithms can be employed to learn the source metric beforehand. Then the pre-learned source metric is represented as a set of knowledge fragments to help target metric learning. We show how generalization error in the target domain could be reduced using the proposed transfer strategy, and develop novel algorithm to learn either linear or nonlinear target metric. Extensive experiments on various applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Heterogeneous Multi-task Metric Learning across Multiple Domains**

Distance metric learning (DML) plays a crucial role in diverse machine learning algorithms and applications. When the labeled information in target domain is limited, transfer metric learning (TML) helps to learn the metric by leveraging the sufficient information from other related domains. Multi-task metric learning (MTML), which can be regarded as a special case of TML, performs transfer across all related domains. Current TML tools usually assume that the same feature representation is exploited for different domains. However, in real-world applications, data may be drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches can be adopted to remedy this drawback by deriving a metric from the learned transformation across different domains. But they are often limited in that only two domains can be handled. To appropriately handle multiple domains, we develop a novel heterogeneous multi-task metric learning (HMTML) framework. In HMTML, the metrics of all different domains are learned together. The transformations derived from the metrics are utilized to induce a common subspace, and the high-order covariance among the predictive structures of these domains is maximized in this subspace. There do exist a few heterogeneous transfer learning approaches that deal with multiple domains, but the high-order statistics (correlation information), which can only be exploited by simultaneously examining all domains, is ignored in these approaches. Compared with them, the proposed HMTML can effectively explore such high-order information, thus obtaining more reliable feature transformations and metrics. Effectiveness of our method is validated by the extensive and intensive experiments on text categorization, scene classification, and social image annotation.

**Deep-Sentiment: Sentiment Analysis Using Ensemble of CNN and Bi-LSTM Models**

With the popularity of social networks, and e-commerce websites, sentiment analysis has become a more active area of research in the past few years. On a high level, sentiment analysis tries to understand the public opinion about a specific product or topic, or trends from reviews or tweets. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in better understanding customer/user opinion, and also extracting social/political trends. There has been a lot of previous works for sentiment analysis, some based on hand-engineering relevant textual features, and others based on different neural network architectures. In this work, we present a model based on an ensemble of long-short-term-memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN), one to capture the temporal information of the data, and the other one to extract the local structure thereof. Through experimental results, we show that using this ensemble model we can outperform both individual models. We are also able to achieve a very high accuracy rate compared to the previous works.

**A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification**

Few-shot classification aims to learn a classifier to recognize unseen classes during training with limited labeled examples. While significant progress has been made, the growing complexity of network designs, meta-learning algorithms, and differences in implementation details make a fair comparison difficult. In this paper, we present 1) a consistent comparative analysis of several representative few-shot classification algorithms, with results showing that deeper backbones significantly reduce the performance differences among methods on datasets with limited domain differences, 2) a modified baseline method that surprisingly achieves competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art on both the \miniI and the CUB datasets, and 3) a new experimental setting for evaluating the cross-domain generalization ability for few-shot classification algorithms. Our results reveal that reducing intra-class variation is an important factor when the feature backbone is shallow, but not as critical when using deeper backbones. In a realistic cross-domain evaluation setting, we show that a baseline method with a standard fine-tuning practice compares favorably against other state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms.
