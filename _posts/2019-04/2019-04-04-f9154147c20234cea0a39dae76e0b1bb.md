“I’ve been describing term usage: A bit of language analysis. Analysis is an examination of structure, composition, and meaning that provides insight to advance some purpose. Analysis may be heuristic, informal, and/or qualitative.Contrast with analytics, which is algorithmic rather than heuristic. I define analytics as the systematic application of numerical and statistical methods that derive and deliver quantitative information, whether in the form of indicators, tables, or visualizations. Analytics is formal and repeatable.” Seth Grimes ( 2014 )
