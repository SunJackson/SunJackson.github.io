**CrossNets** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose a novel neural network structure called CrossNets, which considers architectures on directed acyclic graphs. This structure builds on previous generalizations of feed forward models, such as ResNets, by allowing for all forward cross connections between layers (both adjacent and non-adjacent). The addition of cross connections among the network increases information flow across the whole network, leading to better training and testing performances. The superior performance of the network is tested against four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. We conclude with a proof of convergence for Crossnets to a local minimum for error, where weights for connections are chosen through backpropagation with momentum. … 

**Parsimonious Learning Machine (PALM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Data stream has been the underlying challenge in the age of big data because it calls for real-time data processing with the absence of a retraining process and/or an iterative learning approach. In realm of fuzzy system community, data stream is handled by algorithmic development of self-adaptive neurofuzzy systems (SANFS) characterized by the single-pass learning mode and the open structure property which enables effective handling of fast and rapidly changing natures of data streams. The underlying bottleneck of SANFSs lies in its design principle which involves a high number of free parameters (rule premise and rule consequent) to be adapted in the training process. This figure can even double in the case of type-2 fuzzy system. In this work, a novel SANFS, namely parsimonious learning machine (PALM), is proposed. PALM features utilization of a new type of fuzzy rule based on the concept of hyperplane clustering which significantly reduces the number of network parameters because it has no rule premise parameters. PALM is proposed in both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems where all of which characterize a fully dynamic rule-based system. That is, it is capable of automatically generating, merging and tuning the hyperplane based fuzzy rule in the single pass manner. The efficacy of PALM has been evaluated through numerical study with six real-world and synthetic data streams from public database and our own real-world project of autonomous vehicles. The proposed model showcases significant improvements in terms of computational complexity and number of required parameters against several renowned SANFSs, while attaining comparable and often better predictive accuracy. … 

**linearized Gaussian Process** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC), where the system model is learned from data with machine learning, has recently gained increasing interests in the control community. Gaussian Processes (GP), as a type of statistical models, are particularly attractive due to their modeling flexibility and their ability to provide probabilistic estimates of prediction uncertainty. GP-based MPC has been developed and applied, however the optimization problem is typically non-convex and highly demanding, and scales poorly with model size. This causes unsatisfactory solving performance, even with state-of-the-art solvers, and makes the approach less suitable for real-time control. We develop a method based on a new concept, called linearized Gaussian Process, and Sequential Convex Programming, that can significantly improve the solving performance of GP-based MPC. Our method is not only faster but also much more scalable and predictable than other commonly used methods, as it is much less influenced by the model size. The efficiency and advantages of the algorithm are demonstrated clearly in a numerical example. …
