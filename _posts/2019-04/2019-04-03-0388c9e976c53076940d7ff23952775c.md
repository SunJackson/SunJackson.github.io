**Unit-B** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present Unit-B, a formal method inspired by Event-B and UNITY. Unit-B aims at the stepwise design of software systems satisfying safety and liveness properties. The method features the novel notion of coarse and fine schedules, a generalisation of weak and strong fairness for specifying events’ scheduling assumptions. Based on events schedules, we propose proof rules to reason about progress properties and a refinement order preserving both liveness and safety properties. We illustrate our approach by an example to show that systems development can be driven by not only safety but also liveness requirements. … 

**CUSBoost** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Class imbalance classification is a challenging research problem in data mining and machine learning, as most of the real-life datasets are often imbalanced in nature. Existing learning algorithms maximise the classification accuracy by correctly classifying the majority class, but misclassify the minority class. However, the minority class instances are representing the concept with greater interest than the majority class instances in real-life applications. Recently, several techniques based on sampling methods (under-sampling of the majority class and over-sampling the minority class), cost-sensitive learning methods, and ensemble learning have been used in the literature for classifying imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering-based under-sampling approach with boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm, called CUSBoost, for effective imbalanced classification. The proposed algorithm provides an alternative to RUSBoost (random under-sampling with AdaBoost) and SMOTEBoost (synthetic minority over-sampling with AdaBoost) algorithms. We evaluated the performance of CUSBoost algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods based on ensemble learning like AdaBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost on 13 imbalance binary and multi-class datasets with various imbalance ratios. The experimental results show that the CUSBoost is a promising and effective approach for dealing with highly imbalanced datasets. … 

**Shortest Processing Time (SPT)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The shortest processing time rule orders the jobs in the order of increasing processing times. Whenever a machine is freed, the shortest job ready at the time will begin processing. This algorithm is optimal for finding the minimum total completion time and weighted completion time. In the single machine environment with ready time at 0 for all jobs, this algorithm is optimal in minimizing the mean flow time, minimizing the mean number of jobs in the system, minimizing the mean waiting time of the jobs from the time of arrival to the start of processing, minimizing the maximum waiting time and the mean lateness. …
