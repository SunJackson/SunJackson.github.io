**Dataset Distillation** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Model distillation aims to distill the knowledge of a complex model into a simpler one. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation called {\em dataset distillation}: we keep the model fixed and instead attempt to distill the knowledge from a large training dataset into a small one. The idea is to {\em synthesize} a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. For example, we show that it is possible to compress $60,000$ MNIST training images into just $10$ synthetic {\em distilled images} (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few steps of gradient descent, given a particular fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in a wide range of initialization settings and with different learning objectives. Experiments on multiple datasets show the advantage of our approach compared to alternative methods in most settings. … 

**Prais-Winsten Estimation** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In econometrics, Prais-Winsten estimation is a procedure meant to take care of the serial correlation of type AR(1) in a linear model. Conceived by Sigbert Prais and Christopher Winsten in 1954, it is a modification of Cochrane-Orcutt estimation in the sense that it does not lose the first observation and leads to more efficiency as a result. … 

**Accelerated Alternating Projections** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We study robust PCA for the fully observed setting, which is about separating a low rank matrix $\boldsymbol{L}$ and a sparse matrix $\boldsymbol{S}$ from their sum $\boldsymbol{D}=\boldsymbol{L}+\boldsymbol{S}$. In this paper, a new algorithm, termed accelerated alternating projections, is introduced for robust PCA which accelerates existing alternating projections proposed in [Netrapalli, Praneeth, et al., 2014]. Let $\boldsymbol{L}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{S}_k$ be the current estimates of the low rank matrix and the sparse matrix, respectively. The algorithm achieves significant acceleration by first projecting $\boldsymbol{D}-\boldsymbol{S}_k$ onto a low dimensional subspace before obtaining the new estimate of $\boldsymbol{L}$ via truncated SVD. Exact recovery guarantee has been established which shows linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. Empirical performance evaluations establish the advantage of our algorithm over other state-of-the-art algorithms for robust PCA. …
