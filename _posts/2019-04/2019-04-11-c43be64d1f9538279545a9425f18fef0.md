Laura Vana introduced the R-Ladies Vienna â€“ a program initiated by the R-Consortium to

> 
achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

Visit the Meetup site to find out more about upcoming R-Ladies events including workshops covering an R Introduction and Bayesian Statistics.

## Tidy(er) Data

Hadley Wickhamâ€™s talk covered the **tidyr** package and two new functions: `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()` which have finally been renamed to `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` as a result of a survey, see also the posts on Twitter and Github. These function should replace `gather()` and `spread()` since they seem to be hard-to-remember for most users coming to **tidyr**.

## First Impressions

Below you can find the first impressions of the Meetup on our new Youtube channel. The full talks are still being cut and optimized â€“ so stay tuned for the full talks from Laura and Hadley â€“ to be released on our Youtube Channel by next week â€“ feel free to subscribe ðŸ™‚
