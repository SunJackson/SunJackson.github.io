As the sakura bloomed in Tokyo, another TokyoR UserMeetup was held, this timeat SONY City! On April 13th useRs from all over Tokyo (and some evenfrom further afield) flocked to Osaki, Tokyo for a special sessionfocused on beginner R users, **BeginneRs**. We’ve also had several special“themed” sessions in the past like TokyoR #69: Bayesianstatistics in June last year as well asthe TokyoR #70: Hadley Wickham + Joe RickertSpecial! last July. Althoughmainly for BeginneRs, the LTs for this session were applications ofR/case studies and may be of more interest to non-beginners if you wantto skip ahead to that section.

Like my previous round up posts (for TokyoR#76 andJapanR Conference#9)I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my effortswill help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider Rcommunity. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links fromother sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic ofa certain talk. You can follow **Tokyo.R** by searching for the#TokyoR hashtag on Twitter.

These were the same set of beginner user focused talks that happens atthe start of every TokyoR meetup:

Since this was a special **BeginneR** session, the main talks were allfocused on even more introductory stuff on top of the usual beginner’ssession in the previous section.

## kilometer00: Using R for Data Analysis

First up, `@kilometer00` talked about doing data analysis with R. As abrief introduction he talked about what exactly IS data analysis, how wemight go about forming a research problem and hypothesis, and how thesesteps are important in figuring out what kind of modeling we mightattempt to do on the data at hand. The modeling techniques`@kilometer00` covered were just the basics such as single/multiplelinear regression and PCA.

In the last part of the talk he covered nested data modelling. By using`group_by()` and `nest()` we can create a data frame that has one rowper group (for example, a row for **each** species group in the irisdata set) with has a new column called `data` which is itself a dataframe. Now, instead of having to repeat the modelling code over and overagain for each subset of rows (a model for **each** species in the irisdata set), by using the `purrr::map_*()` family of functions you canapply your model to each of the groups that you specified earlier.

Filled with great explanatory graphics, plots, and code the slides are agood example of teaching the basics of modelling with R.

Some other resources about modelling with R:

## aad34210: Become a useR with R Studio

Another TokyoR organizer, `@aad34210`, talked about using the R StudioIDE to maximize R’s strengths for programming and data analysis. After abrief spiel on the early days of using R solely from the console hetalked about R Studio’s capabilities and the various options that can becustomized to suit your R needs. From installing R Studio, configuringthe four main panes, using R Projects, and using `Global options`,`aad34210` opened up his own R Studio window and pointed out the variousmenu options in thorough detail to help beginneRs navigate withoutgetting overwhelmed. He rounded off the talk by showing the variousCheat sheets (included one for R Studio itself) that can be obtainedfrom the `Help` tab.

Some other resources one might consider to learn R Studio are:

## u_ribo: Version Control and Project Management with R

`@u_ribo` gave a talk about the benefits of creating a reproducible andenclosed R environment using git and Docker. As an instructor who hasran many R workshops, `@u_ribo` has ran into the problem of his learnersall having different OSs, versions of packages, and versions of R itselfcausing much headache for all involved. This is also the case whenworking in a team environment where analyses need to be shared andreproducibility of results is essential.

To reduce these problems he gave a live-demo using a variety of R toolssuch as the `here` package, the `usethis` package, and managing aproject environment with R Studio Projects (`.Rproj`). To go further indepth he also talked about using git (made very easy with its seamlessintegration with R Studio) and the use of Docker. To run Docker youneed an Docker “image” and a Docker “container”. An image is a file,called a `Dockerfile`, that has the information about and configures theOperating System for the environment. The container is the the actualrunning instance of the “image” that is defined by the Docker file.Going back to the issue of running a workshop, using Docker allows allof the participants to run R inside a specific container, an enclosed environmentset up by the instructor, so that all the different dependencies andversion differences won’t prevent you from running the code provided inthe workshop.

Other good introductions to Docker and R:

## niszet: Reproducible Reports with R Markdown

`@niszet` talked about reproducible reporting with R Markdown. He wascertainly the right person to give a talk on this topic as he is theauthor of the mini-books, “Create a Word document with R Markdown” and“Create a PowerPoint presentation with R Markdown”. To begin, he talkedabout cases where one writes a document, report, or any kind of outputand how it might be a good idea to be able to create it again for“future me” or anybody else that might want to take a look. Normally,you would run into problems such as “where did my data go?”, “how did Ipre-process my data?”, “” but you can mitigate these problems by using RMarkdown reports. Whether it’s importing your raw data, thepre-processing/modelling/viz code, to the actual report anddocumentation write-up R Markdown renders the document in a completelyclean environment each time so the results should be the same, everytime! As noted in the beginning, you can create many different kinds ofoutput such as Word document, PowerPoint presentation, html document,presentation slides, and more – even business cards (with the pagedownpackage)! Following an explanation of what you can do with R Markdown,`@niszet` talked about **how** exactly one would use it to its bestcapabilities. In a live-demo he took us through all the differentcomponents of an R Markdown document:

- YAML header: Where one defines the “how” of the RMD such as thetitle, template, output directory, output type, etc.

- Code chunk and options: Where all your code (can be languagesbesides R) that you want to be run should be located. Chunk options such aswhether to evaluate the code within, toggle showing the code, andmany more are also specified here.

- Markdown text: Regular text using markdown. Can also include inlinecode using “.

- Various buttons/shortcut keys: Such as `Ctrl + Shift + K` to Knit!

## GotaMorishita: Finding a New Place to Live with R

It’s only been 3 (three!) days since `@GotaMorishita` started learning Ryet here he was giving a LT on finding a new place to live in Tokyousing R! Tired of living with his parents `@GotaMorishita` decided tolive by himself and started thinking about ways to use R and machinelearning to search for a place with an optimal price and location. Afterweb-scraping a housing website and pre-processing the data he cameacross a problem: if he split the data into a training and test set forselecting the best predictive model then he would be throwing away aconsiderable amount of possible candidates for housing.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77_files/morishita1.PNG?w=450)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77_files/morishita1.PNG?w=450)


If `@GotaMorishita` took out 90% of the houses/apartments from thetraining data and kept those as candidates for the test data, it woudl’ve meantthat the training data will have a markedly different distributioncompared to the test data set and the model created from the trainingset wouldn’t be as accurate. This problem, called co-variate shifting, is when the training data andtest data have different distributions but the conditional distributionof the output values given the input data is unchanged. Using standardmethods of model selection such as cross-validation or AIC in thissituation leads to biasedness. However, this problem can be mitigated byweighting the loss function by importance (the ratio of training andtest input densities). You can find a more detailed description in theresearch papers below. `@GotaMorishita` used `xgboost` to implement hismodels, one with importance weighting and another without, and usedgroup-wise cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters. The results areshown below, comparing the overall test scores for all Tokyo districts(left) and just the Sangenjaya district (right), the RMSE was smallerwhen Importance Weighting was used.

## sk_bono36: Creating Marketing Personas with R and rtweet

`@sk_bono36` gave a presentation on using R for marketing purposes withthe `rtweet` package. In marketing there is a concept called a “persona”which is a blueprint of what a certain type of person in your targetaudience for your product/service is like. A basic persona templatecan consist of their name, job title, demographic details, values, andhobbies. You create these ideal customers through careful marketresearch involving both social media analytics andinterviewing/surveying the customers themselves. `@sk_bono36` focused oncreating a `persona` (with “自転車/Bicycle” as the keyword for this casestudy) by using `rtweet` then running Japanese text analysis with`RMeCab`. Visualizing the data with word clouds and network graphs ofbi-grams he was able to find a lot of information on Twitter users whohave “bicycle” on their profile or tweets and extract the commoncharacteristics of this type of person.

As a result of his analysis `@sk_bono36` was able to create a persona ofpeople who like bicycles:

Some other intros to the `rtweet` package:

## igjit: Create a type-checker package for R

`@igjit`, who also presented atJapan.R back in December onbuilding an R compiler withR,gave a talk about another recent project of his which is a package thatacts as a type checking system for R. A problem that he finds in R isthat errors relating to having the wrong data type in the arguments of Rfunctions are only found when code is executed, not before. Frustratedby this `@igjit` created his own package calledtyprr that type checks your code! Theunderlying checker that `typrr` runs isFlycheck which is a syntaxchecking extension for Emacs.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77_files/igjitError.JPG?w=350)


For now, the package only checks for the basic data types found in R,integer, double, logical, and character and it can only check functionswith one argument only. He rounded off the talk by saying that hecreated this package just for fun and he advised all the beginneRs inthe audience that people learn from **doing** rather than just**reading** so to truly get better it’s best to go out and experiment!

Following all of the talks, those who were staying for the after-partywere served sushi and drinks! With a loud rendition of “kampai!”(cheers!) R users from all over Tokyo began to talk about theirsuccesses and struggles with R. A fun tradition at `TokyoR` is a**Rock-Paper-Scissors** tournament with the prize being **free** datascience books (I still haven’t won any nor even gotten close to the last rounds)!

The prizes for this month was:

- A couple copies of “Create a Word document with R Markdown”mini-book by niszet.

- 3 copies of the Japanese translation (by Hoxo-mInc.) of “Feature Engineering for MachineLearning” by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari provided byuribo.


`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle withJapanese R users as it’s the largest regular meetup here in Japan. Talksin English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
