Amazon Comprehend is a fully managed natural language processing (NLP) service that enables text analytics for important workloads. For example, analyzing market research reports for key market indicators or data that contains PII information. Customers that work with highly sensitive, encrypted data can now easily enable Comprehend to work with this encrypted data via an integration with the AWS Key Management Service.

AWS KMS makes it easy for you to create and manage keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. AWS KMS is a secure and resilient service that uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules to protect your keys. AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide you with logs of all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.

To enable Comprehend to use KMS keys to access data, the feature can be configured via the AWS Management console or the SDK and supports Amazon Comprehend asynchronous training and inference jobs. To get started you first need to create a key in the AWS KMS service.  To learn more about how to create KMS keys, please visit: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html

When you are configuring an asynchronous job, you can specify the KMS encryption key the Comprehend should use to access your data in S3. Below is an example of selecting a key with the alias “Comprehend” as part of configuring job details, in the Amazon Comprehend console:

To manage your AWS KMS keys, please visit the AWS KMS management portal or use the KMS SDK.  For more information, please visit: AWS Key Management Service. To learn more about how to configure Comprehend jobs to work with KMS keys, please visit our documentation:
