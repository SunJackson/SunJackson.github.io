Back in January we announced the first Shiny contest. The timehas come to share the results with you!

First and foremost, we were overwhelmed (in the best way possible!)by the 136 submissions! Reviewing all these submissions was incrediblyinspiring and humbling. We really appreciate the time and effort each contestsantput into building these apps, as well as submitting them as a fully reproducibleartifacts via RStudio Cloud.

Letâ€™s start with a few stats about the contest submissions:

- There were 136 submissions from 122 unique app developers!

- Approximately 92% of these developers submitted one entry for the contest and approximately 7% submitted two entries.

- There was one developer who submitted three entries and one developer whosubmitted five!


And here is a look at the growth of submissions over timeâ€¦

So many of these apps were quite complex, very well-designed, and fun to interactwith. Saying that selecting winners was difficult would be the biggest understatementof the year! But we promised to do it, so we did! Below we list the honorablementions, runners up, and last but not least, the winners of the first Shiny contest.

Before we get to them though, a quick point of claerification: we had promised twowinners, one in the novice and one in the open category. However since we didnâ€™task developers to self select into these categories it was very difficult to placeapps into these categories post-hoc. So instead we picked four winners invarious categories. At the end of the post we also discuss how this experiencewill help shape the definitions of winning categories in the next Shiny contest.

Over the next week we will be getting in touch with all the winners, runners up,and honorable mentions to arrange delivery of their awards and to highlighttheir submissions on the Shiny User Showcase.

## Runners up

The following six apps are our runners up, and once again presented here inno particular order. Congratulations to the developers who have won thefollowing:

- One year of shinyapps.io Basic plan

- All hex/RStudio stickers we can find

- Any number of RStudio t-shirts, books, and mugs (worth up to $200)


### A Virtual Lab for Teaching Physiology

If we were judging solely by ambition of vision, this submission byDavid Granjon would have to be ourwinner! The centerpiece of this app is a strikingly detailed visNetwork,but the patient simulator idea is interesting as well.

### ScotPHO Online Profiles Tool

This app by Jaime Villacampa, Zsanett Bahor, and Vicky Elliott was createdto help people living and working in Scotland explore how geographical areashave changed over time or how they compare to other areas, across a range ofindicators of health and wider determinants of health. The app is pretty complicated,but no more than it has to be with such a sprawling dataset behind it. Each partof the app has a carefully curated set of options that expose lots of powerwithout being totally overwhelming. The context-sensitive Definition buttonand pervasive â€œDownload dataâ€�/â€œSave chartâ€� options are nice touches as well.

### tidytuesday.rocks

If you havenâ€™t heard of #TidyTuesday, youâ€™re missing out on one of the mostdynamic virtual events in the R community. The tidytuesday.rocks app byNeal Grantham is a tastefullyminimalist interface for exploring previous weeksâ€™ datasets and communitysubmissions for visualizations.

### CRAN Explorer

There are plenty of Shiny apps for exploring CRAN metadata, but none of them lookas striking as this one by nz-stefan!This is a really nice example of HTML Template usage; the separation between theR UI and the raw HTML UI is extremely clean.

### The Shiny LEGO mosaic creator

This app by Eric Nantz is just fun!Upload any (relatively small) image and within seconds this app will design aLEGO mosaic for you, complete with a list of required bricks and build instructions!

## Honorable mentions

Remember how we said earlier that there so many gems among the submissions andhow it was so difficult to choose between them? Yeah, it was! The followingtwenty-one apps are the honorable mentions. The developers of these apps willreceive one year of shinyapps.io Basic Plan and one RStudio t-shirt.

We have linked to the RStudio Community post for each of the submissions whereyou can read more about each app, interact with it, and reproduce it in RStudioCloud.

## Next Shiny contest

The first Shiny contest was not only fun to review, but we also learned a lotabout how to structure it next time around. (Oh yeah, there will be a next time!)Our plan is to pre-identify clear categories for winners and announce them at thebeginning of the contest. Weâ€™re pretty sure you will wow us again, and developapps that are awe-inspiring and donâ€™t fit into any of the categories we outlined,and weâ€™ll want to update things again for the third round of the contest, butcâ€™est la vie! We will also plan better for a high number of submissionsso that we can turn around the review quicker (thank you for your patience thistime around!).
