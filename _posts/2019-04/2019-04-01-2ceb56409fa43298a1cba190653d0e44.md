Kaggle was founded on the principles of meritocracy, and our community has thrived as a place where anyone—regardless of background or degree—can earn accolades for their performance in machine learning competitions. Over the years, we’ve seen how one’s Kaggle rankings in competitions and community contributions can serve as powerful credentials in the data science industry.

Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of the newest and highest Kaggle tier of all: **The Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmaster. **

This next tier of achievement uses the same core value of meritocracy to give advanced Kagglers the recognition they so richly deserve. 

(It does not make any changes to the existing points system.)

For each of the categories: Competitions, Kernels, and Discussion, you will be able to achieve the latest performance tier of Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmaster. You will still be able to advance tiers within each category independently. Your overall tier is the highest of the three individual category tiers.

All promotions to Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmaster must also be accompanied by a personal recommendation of a current Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmaster, and a notarized letter from an elected official highlighting one’s worthiness. 

We have decided to posthumously award Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmaster status to Alan Turing, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace.

We look forward to watching the community continue to compete, collaborate, and pursue personal growth in the evolving world of data science. We plan to take the following year to evaluate our progression system, and see if Great-Great-Great-Great-Great Grandmaster status will need to be added next April 1st.

Happy Modeling!
