The `tools` package that comes with base R makes checking reverse dependencies super easy.

1. Build your package tarball (the `pkg_x.y.z.tar.gz` file).`R CMD build /your/package/location`


It is a good idea to make sure that the tarball is in a dedicated directory, because the next step will download and install reverse dependencies in the directory where the tarball resides.

1. In an R terminal type


```

result <- check_packages_in_dir("/directory/containing/tarball"
 , revdep = list() )

```

The result can be printed and summarized and analyzed further if there is any breakage. Here’s an example of output when I ran this on my gower package today.

```

> result
Check results for packages in dir '/home/mark/projects/gower/output':
Package sources: 1, Reverse depends: 5
Use summary() for more information.
> summary(result)
Check results for packages in dir '/home/mark/projects/gower/output':

Check status summary:
 ERROR NOTE OK
 Source packages 0 0 1
 Reverse depends 1 3 1

Check results summary:
gower ... OK
rdepends_ceterisParibus ... NOTE
* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
rdepends_lime ... ERROR
* checking tests ... ERROR
* checking re-building of vignette outputs ... WARNING
rdepends_live ... NOTE
rdepends_recipes ... NOTE
* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
rdepends_simputation ... OK

```

(Checking the logs in `output/rdepends_lime.Rcheck/00check.log` shows that `lime` fails because of a missing JAVA engine [I just updated my OS and have no JAVA installed yet].)

**Notes**

1. Checking reverse dependencies can be done in parallel by setting the `Ncpus` argument larger than one.

1. Be aware that the documentation states that (R 3.5.2) *This functionality is still experimental: interfaces may change in future versions.* Nevertheless, it has worked fine for me so far.
