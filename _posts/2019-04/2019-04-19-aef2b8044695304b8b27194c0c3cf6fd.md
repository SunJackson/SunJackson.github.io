Hi there! Yes, *it’s the most Easterful time of the year* again. For some of us a sacret time, for others mainly an egg-eating period and some just enjoy the extra day of spare time. In case you have some time available for some good egg searching business, but no-one seems willing to hide them for you this year, here’s an alteRnative. Hide them yourself and have a nice easteR holyday! As you go, you also get to know the very nice image processing package: magick. 

## Get some easter scenes, collect some eggs…

Before we can start hiding eggs, we need some scenes…

…and – obviously – we need some eggs to hide!

## Hiding Eggs function

Excellent, we have some scenes and some eggs, let’s create a function to make hiding our eggs easy. We’ll take advantage of some other functions from the great image processing package **magick**. 

Yeah, we’ve hidden 5 eggs near these happy easter bunnies. Can you spot them in a few seconds??

These guys also seem to enjoy our little game. Finally, let’s make a somewhat more challenging version, you can share it with your relatives, wishing them a nice easter holiday.

In case your audience can’t figure out where you hid the eggs, magick lets you animate your pictures, so:

For much more you can do with magick, see the vignette. 

That’s it, have yourself a merry little easter egg!
