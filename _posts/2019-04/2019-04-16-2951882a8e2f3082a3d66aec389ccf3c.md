We will create a simple (but robust) DataOps environment in the platform using the tools: TravisCI, DVC, Git and GitHub.

 

### Git:

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

In data science **git** is like our internal manager with a great memory. It will remember everything you have did, how you did it and the history of every file in the repository.

Git is installed by default in MatrixDS but we will need to set up two configurations. First letâ€™s open a new terminal and type:



to set your name and then



to set your email.

I recommend that the email you put there is the same one you have on GitHub.

To start working with this repository just clone it:



And then go to the directory:



Because this is already a Git repo you donâ€™t need to initialize it, but if you are starting from scratch, youâ€™ll need to type:



On the folder you want your repository.

 

### DVC:

DVC or Data Version Control is an open-source version control system for Machine Learning Projects, and data science projects too. This video explains it better:


Because we are using Python, we will install DVC by:



As the documentation says in order to start using DVC, you need first to initialize it in your projectâ€™s directory. DVC doesnâ€™t require Git and can work without any source control management system, but for**the best experience we recommend using DVC on top of Git repositories.**

**IMPORTANT COMMENT:**

> **There are errors right now with some configurations in MatrixDS for DVC, so in order to run DVC youâ€™ll have to do it in a different folder, not in /home/matrix. For that do this (Iâ€™m assuming you have the original project in the default folder):**



So to start using DVC with our repo we just type:



If for some reason, that doesnâ€™t work for you on MatrixDS, install DVC for linux:



If for some reason you get the error:



Do a



and then type:



Ok, so if you ran **dvc init**on this repo youâ€™ll see:







Then commit your work (if you change the folder you may need to configure Git again):



 

### Travis CI:

Travis CI (Continuous Integration) is my favorite CI tool. Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently, rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments.

The hidden concept here is automatic testing of what you are doing. When we are programming we are doing a lot of stuff all the time, we are testing new things, trying new libraries and more, and itâ€™s not uncommon to mess things up. CI helps you with that because you will begin doing your work, commit a little bit of it with Git, and you should have the necessary tests to see if the new piece of code or analysis you made impacts (in a good or bar way) your project.

Thereâ€™s a lot more to know about Travis and CI tools, but the plan here is to use it, youâ€™ll learn on the way. So the first thing you have to do is to go to:

**Travis CI - Test and Deploy Your Code with Confidence**travis-ci.org

and create an account with your GitHub profile.

Then you will go**(Iâ€™m assuming here that you have successfully forked the repo from GitHub at this point)**and then on https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories you will choose**ds-optimus:**

and then activate the repo

If everything went well youâ€™ll see something like this:

Ok so right now this is empty because we donâ€™t have anything to test yet. Thatâ€™s fine, will get to that in following articles. But right now we need to built the basic file that will trigger â€œtravis buildsâ€�.

We need for that a .travis.yml file, and this is the basics content it should have:



As you can see we also need a requirements.txt file, in our case it will only be optimus for now.

> If you have a fork of the project on GitHub make sure to add my master as an upstream because the files will be already there.

If you donâ€™t know how to add an upstream hereâ€™s how:

**How to Keep a Downstream git Repository Current with Upstream Repository Changes***This article demonstrates how to keep a downstream repository current with upstream repository changes as you performâ€¦* medium.com

Then we have to push the commit that adds â€œ.travis.ymlâ€� to the project.

Then when you go to travis again you will see your first build:

For now it will give us an error because we havenâ€™t create any test to run:

But donâ€™t worry we will get to that later.

Thanks for seeing the update and start setting up your environment for this project. If you have any questions please write me here:
