With almost year passed since the previous 0.1.0 release, a nice new release of the tint package arrived on CRAN today. Its name expands from *tint is not tufte* as the package offers a fresher take on the Tufte-style for html and pdf presentations.

This version adds new features, and a new co-author. Jonathan Gilligan calmly and persistently convinced me that there was ‘life beyond Roboto’ and I overcame the reluctance to offer other fonts. So now we have two additional reference implementations for Lato and Garamond which look stunning, as well as generally enhanced support for fonts, font families and entire LaTeX templates all via the standard YAML headers.

A screenshot for Lato follows:

The full list of changes is below.

Changes in tint version 0.1.1 (2019-03-30)


The two pdf styles have been extended allowing more flexible LaTeX customization particularly for fonts but also link colour. (Jonathan in #30)


Two example documents where added pre-rendered (and not as vignettes to keep processing lighter)


Documentation for the HTML style was updates (Jonathan in #30).




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a comparison to the previous release. More information is on the tint page.
