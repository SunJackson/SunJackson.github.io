This post introduces the new R package `graphlayouts` which is available on CRAN since a few days. We will usenetwork data from the *Game of Thrones* TV series (seemed timely at the time of writing)to illustrate the core layout algorithms of the package. Most of the algorithms usestress majorization as its basis, which I described in more detail in and older post. Here, I will onlyfocus on the practical aspects of the package.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(graphlayouts)
library(ggraph)
library(extrafont)
loadfonts()
```

To illustrate the functionality of `graphlayouts` we will use data compiled from theTV Show *Game of Thrones*, specifically the character interaction networks. See here and here for original work with the data. The raw data can be downloaded from github. We do this using the `map()` function of `purrr`.

```
edges <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbeveridge/gameofthrones/master/data/got-s",1:7,"-edges.csv")
edges_tbl <- map(edges,read_csv)
```

Next, we transform the raw edgelists into igraph objects, again using `map`.

```
got_graphs <- map(1:7,function(x) {
 g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges_tbl[x],directed = F)
 g$title <- paste0("Season ",x)
 g
 })
```

Lastly, we transform and add some node variables. First, we change the character names fromupper case to title case. Then we compute a clustering, and the total number of interactions per character.

```
mutate_graph <- function(x){
 V(x)$name <- str_replace_all(V(x)$name,"\\_"," ") %>% 
 str_to_title()
 clu <- cluster_louvain(x)
 V(x)$clu <- as.character(clu$membership)
 V(x)$size <- graph.strength(x)
 x
}

got_graphs <- map(got_graphs,mutate_graph)
```

`got_graphs` now contains all seven season networks in a list. `graphlayouts` containsthe function `qgraph()` which can be used to get a very rough visualization of the network,without the need of lengthy `ggraph` code.

```
qgraph(got_graphs[[1]])
```

The function is very similar to `qplot()` from `ggplot2`, yet it does not take any additional arguments.This is planned for a later release.

The core layout algorithm of `graphlayouts` is implemented in the function `layout_with_stress()`, which is alsocalled in `qgraph` by the way. The package also contains a convenience function to work smoothly with `ggraph`.Instead of

```
xy <- layout_with_stress(x)
ggraph(x,layout="manual",node.positions=data.frame(x=xy[,1],y=xy[,2]))+...
```

you can do

```
ggraph(x,layout = "stress")+...
```

Creating nice plots is now “just” a matter of stitching some `ggraph` code together.For our character networks, we define a function that does that for all seasons simultaneously.I usually would not use hard to read fonts for visualizations but I thought *Enchanted Land* (available here) kind of fits here.

```
got_palette <- c("#1A5878","#C44237","#AD8941","#E99093",
 "#50594B","#DE9763","#5D5F5D","#E2E9E7")

plot_graph <- function(x){
 ggraph(x,layout = "stress")+
 geom_edge_link0(aes(width=Weight),edge_colour="grey66")+
 geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),shape=21,col="grey25")+
 geom_node_text(aes(size=size,label=name),family = "Enchanted Land",repel=F)+
 scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.1,1.5))+
 scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,8))+
 scale_fill_manual(values=got_palette)+
 theme_graph(title_family = "Enchanted Land",
 title_size = 20)+
 labs(title=paste0("Game of Thrones (",x$title,")"))+
 theme(legend.position = "none")
}

got_plot <- map(got_graphs,plot_graph)
got_plot[[1]]
```

The advantages of stress based layouts are outlined in this post. It has been my gotolayout algorithm since years and I’d wish that more SNA software would implement it.The below figure shows all seven network in one plot.

The last important layout algorithm is `layout_as_backbone()` which is tailored to workwith “hairball” networks that may contain a hidden group structure. The below plot shows its impressive performance.

Of course the network used in the above example is specifically tailored to show this power. Sowhat about real networks?

We will put all seasons together and create one big GoT network that contains allcharacter interactions from Season 1-7 to illustrate its performance with our example.

```
got_all <- map_dfr(edges_tbl,bind_rows) %>% 
 group_by(Source,Target) %>% 
 summarise(Weight=sum(Weight)) %>% 
 ungroup() %>% 
 rename(weight=Weight) %>% 
 mutate_if(is.character,function(x) str_replace_all(x,"\\_"," ") %>% 
 str_to_title()) %>% 
 graph_from_data_frame(directed=FALSE)

clu <- cluster_louvain(got_all)
V(got_all)$clu <- as.character(clu$membership)
V(got_all)$size <- graph.strength(got_all)
```

First, let’s check what it looks like using `layout_with_stress()`.

```
ggraph(got_all,layout="stress")+
 geom_edge_link0(aes(width=weight),edge_colour="grey66",alpha=0.5)+
 geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),shape=21)+
 scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.8,1.8))+
 scale_size_continuous(range=c(2,10))+
 scale_fill_manual(values=got_palette)+
 theme_graph(title_family = "Enchanted Land",
 subtitle_family = "Enchanted Land",
 title_size = 20,
 subtitle_size = 16)+
 labs(title=paste0("Game of Thrones"),subtitle = "Character Network (Season 1-7)")+
 theme(legend.position = "none")
```

It is clearly hard to see anything here, since the network is too dense. Enter,`layout_as_backbone()`. The algorithm itself is rather involved but some of the key points are:

- Find strongly embedded edges depending on graph motifs

- Compute the union of all maximum spanning trees to “hold the network together”


If you are interested in all the technical details, consult the original paper.

`layout_as_backbone()` takes a parameter `to_keep` which determines the percentage of edgesto keep for the layout calculation. In our case, we will the 20% most embedded edges.(The parameter always requires some experimenting to find out what works best). Note that this does not mean that we throw away the rest of the edges. They are just not used to calculate the layout.But you can still do that afterwards (as we will do here) since the function returns a logicalvector which indicates if an edge belongs to the backbone or not.

```
bb <- layout_as_backbone(got_all,keep=0.2)
E(got_all)$backbone <- F
E(got_all)$backbone[bb$backbone] <- T

ggraph(got_all,layout="manual",node.positions=data.frame(x=bb$xy[,1],y=bb$xy[,2]))+
 geom_edge_link0(aes(filter=backbone,width=weight),edge_colour="grey66",alpha=0.5)+
 geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),shape=21)+
 geom_node_text(aes(filter=(size>=800),size=size,label=name),
 family = "Enchanted Land",repel=T)+
 scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.8,1.8))+
 scale_size_continuous(range=c(2,10))+
 scale_fill_manual(values=got_palette)+
 theme_graph(title_family = "Enchanted Land",
 subtitle_family = "Enchanted Land",
 title_size = 20,
 subtitle_size = 16)+
 labs(title=paste0("Game of Thrones"),subtitle = "Character Network (Season 1-7)")+
 theme(legend.position = "none")
```

There is definitely not as much structure going on as in the contrived example. The algorithm can’tuncover a hidden structure if there is no such thing to uncover. Yet, the layout stillreveals some structure and clearly enhances readability over the stress based layout.

This post introduced only the core layout algorithms of `graphlayouts`. Check outthe vignette of the package for a more extensive list of algorithms. Also, if you are having troublewith the `ggraph` code, check out my RStudio Addin thatprovides a tiny GUI to plot networks. Now that `graphlayouts` is out, I will continueworking on that package.
