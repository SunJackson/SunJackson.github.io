|**Why should you study a Master in Digital Marketing & Data Science?**|

As the MSc in Digital Marketing & Data Science is now well into its second semester, we sat with program co-director and Digital Marketing professor Margherita Pagani to take the time to discuss why this program is really one a kind. At a time when it is a real challenge for recruiters to find young talents with a “dual competency”, capable of bringing a real added value to industries facing a deep digital transformation, we asked her to reflect on what makes this program so special.
