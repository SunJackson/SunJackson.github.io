After wrapping up the function **batch_woe()** today with the purpose to allow users to apply WoE transformations to many independent variables simultaneously, I have completed the development of major functions in the **MOB** package that can be usable for the model development in a production setting. 

The function **batch_woe()** basically is the wrapper around **cal_woe()** and has two input parameters. The “data” parameter is the data frame that we would deploy binning outcomes and the “slst” parameter is the list of multiple binning specification tables that is either the direct output from the function batch_bin or created manually by combining outputs from multiple binning functions. 

There are also two components in the output of batch_woe(), a list of PSI tables for transformed variables and a data frame with a row index and all transformed variables. The default printout is a PSI summation of all input variables to be transformed. As shown below, all PSI values are below 0.1 and therefore none is concerning.

All source codes of the **MOB** package are available on https://github.com/statcompute/MonotonicBinning and free (as free beer) to download and distribute.
