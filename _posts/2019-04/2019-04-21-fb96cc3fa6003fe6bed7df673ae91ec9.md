Today, I am finally getting around to writing this very sad blog post: **Before you take my DataCamp course please consider the following information about the sexual harassment scandal surrounding DataCamp!**

As many of my fellow instructors and community members have already written excellent articles about what happened, I am providing a collection of tweets and links below for you to judge the situation for yourself. All I have to add is that while I have no personal knowledge of ALL the details surrounding the incident, there are many prominent members of the community who have â€“ and since I highly value their opinion and trust their judgement, I am supporting what has been said!

Itâ€™s making me very sad that my course, which I have put a lot of hard work into and which I was very proud of, and by association my name are now linked to this unfortunate situation. Thatâ€™s why I have not been addressing any feedback messages on my course any more and will not do so for the foreseeable future. At the end of this post, I have collected some efforts to find alternatives for DataCamp courses. The contents of my own course will probably be converted to a series of blog posts.

RStudio, R-Ladies and Women in Data Science and Machine Learning have published public statements, as well as many others:

If you decide that you want to move away from DataCamp, here are some alternatives:
