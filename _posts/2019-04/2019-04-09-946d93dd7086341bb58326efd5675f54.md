Within hours of the page going live, I began to receive email from people who had used the tool and found longer, and longer chains.

I realised I needed to correct this error, and quickly.

So, last night, I ran a query over the database to find the chains with the largest radius. The results are below.

The longest found is a stupendous 52 step chain. It's for a collection of 7 letter words. As per the rules, each word is distinct, each differs from next word by just one letter, and is the shortest path to transition between those two words. It is the chain between **ATLASES** and **CABARET**.

ATLASES → ANLASES → ANLACES → UNLACES → UNLACED → UNLADED → UNFADED → UNFAKED → UNCAKED → UNCAKES → UNCASES → UNEASES → UREASES → CREASES → CRESSES → CROSSES → CROSSER → CRASSER → CRASHER → BRASHER → BRASIER → BRAKIER → BEAKIER → PEAKIER → PECKIER → PICKIER → DICKIER → DICKIES → HICKIES → HACKIES → HACKLES → HECKLES → DECKLES → DECILES → DEFILES → DEFILED → DEVILED → DEVELED → REVELED → RAVELED → RAVENED → HAVENED → HAVERED → WAVERED → WATERED → CATERED → CAPERED → TAPERED → TABERED → TABORED → TABORET → TABARET → CABARET

Below are the results of my search for the longest chain, by word length. There were some trivial one-step solutions to some longer words that rely on the fact that my dictionary contains both American and English spellings of words, such as entries for the *–ise* and *–ize*, or *–lis* and *–liz*, variants of words (e.g. **MATERIALIZED** and **MATERIALISED**).
