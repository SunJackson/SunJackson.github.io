**Dlib** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. It is used in both industry and academia in a wide range of domains including robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance computing environments. Dlib’s open source licensing allows you to use it in any application, free of charge. … 

**Variation Network (VarNet)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper presents the Variation Network (VarNet), a generative model providing means to manipulate the high-level attributes of a given input. The originality of our approach is that VarNet is not only capable of handling pre-defined attributes but can also learn the relevant attributes of the dataset by itself. These two settings can be easily combined which makes VarNet applicable for a wide variety of tasks. Further, VarNet has a sound probabilistic interpretation which grants us with a novel way to navigate in the latent spaces as well as means to control how the attributes are learned. We demonstrate experimentally that this model is capable of performing interesting input manipulation and that the learned attributes are relevant and interpretable. … 

**Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In reinforcement learning, building policies of high-quality is challenging when the feature space of states is small and the training data is limited. Directly transferring data or knowledge from an agent to another agent will not work due to the privacy requirement of data and models. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning approach to considering the privacy requirement and building Q-network for each agent with the help of other agents, namely federated reinforcement learning (FRL). To protect the privacy of data and models, we exploit Gausian differentials on the information shared with each other when updating their local models. In the experiment, we evaluate our FRL framework in two diverse domains, Grid-world and Text2Action domains, by comparing to various baselines. …
