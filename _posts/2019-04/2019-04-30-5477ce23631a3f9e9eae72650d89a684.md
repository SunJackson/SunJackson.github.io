We’re excited to announce the **official release of RStudio 1.2**!

### What’s new in RStudio 1.2?

Over a year in the making, this new release of RStudio includes dozens of new productivity enhancements and capabilities. You’ll now find RStudio a more comfortable workbench for working in SQL, Stan, Python, and D3. Testing your R code is easier, too, with integrations for shinytest and testthat. Create, and test, and publish APIs in R with Plumber. And get more done with background jobs, which let you run R scripts while you work.

Underpinning it all is a new rendering engine based on modern Web standards, so RStudio Desktop looks sharp on displays large and small, and performs better everywhere – especially if you’re using the latest Web technology in your visualizations, Shiny applications, and R Markdown documents. Don’t like how it looks now? No problem–just make your own theme.

You can read more about what’s new this release in the release notes, or our RStudio 1.2 blog series.
