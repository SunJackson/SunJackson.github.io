A new RcppArmadillo release based on the very recent Armadillo upstream release arrived on CRAN earlier today, and will get to Debian shortly.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 587 other packages on CRAN.

The (upstream-only again this time) changes are listed below:

> 


Upgraded to Armadillo release 9.400.2 (Surrogate Miscreant)


faster `cov()` and `cor()`


added `.as_col()` and `.as_row()`


expanded `.shed_rows()` / `.shed_cols()` / `.shed_slices()` to remove rows/columns/slices specified in a vector


expanded `vectorise()` to handle sparse matrices


expanded element-wise versions of `max()` and `min()` to handle sparse matrices


optimised handling of sparse matrix expressions: `sparse % (sparse +- scalar)` and `sparse / (sparse +- scalar)`


expanded `eig_sym()`, `chol()`, `expmat_sym()`, `logmat_sympd()`, `sqrtmat_sympd()`, `inv_sympd()` to print a warning if the given matrix is not symmetric


more consistent detection of vector expressions






Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
