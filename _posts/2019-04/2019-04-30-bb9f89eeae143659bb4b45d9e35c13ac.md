The full talks of the ViennaR March Meetup are finally online: A short Introduction to ViennaR, Laura Vana introducing R-Ladies Vienna and Hadley Wickham with a great introduction to tidy(er) data and the new functions `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`. Stay tuned for the next ViennaR Meetups!

## Laura Vana: R-Ladies





Laura introduced the R-Ladies Vienna – a program initiated by the R-Consortium to

> 
achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

Visit the Meetup site to find out more about upcoming R-Ladies events including workshops covering an R Introduction and Bayesian Statistics.

## Hadley Wickham: Tidy(er) Data





Hadley Wickham’s talk covered the **tidyr** package and two new functions: `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()` which have finally been renamed to `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` as a result of a survey, see also the posts on Twitter and Github. These function should replace `gather()` and `spread()` since they seem to be hard-to-remember for most users coming to **tidyr**.
