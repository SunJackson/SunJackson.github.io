Over the past two decades, Python has evolved from a scripting solution for sysadmins to web development for programmers to the driving force behind machine learning. Industry leaders have been at the forefront of this evolution, and have shared their Top 10 use cases with ActiveState, including:

**Insurance** - learn how Machine Learning (ML) has enabled multinationals to better compete with smaller, more nimble companies that were eating their lunch.

**Finance** - read how one global financial services company was able to integrate digital customer data with behavioral data in order to better understand and make predictions about customers’ financial needs.

**Healthcare** - understand how applying machine learning to clinical data allows doctors to better predict death dates for patients with terminal illnesses, and ensure that palliative care can be provided in a timely manner.
