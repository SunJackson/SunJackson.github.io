Today I am happy to announce a new free course: *Help Your Team Learn R*!

Over the last few years I’ve helped a number of data teams train their analysts to use R. At each company there was a skilled R user who was leading the team’s effort to adopt R.

Each of these internal R advocates, however, had a similar problem: they did not have a background in training. So while they knew that R could help their company, and they were R experts themselves, they struggled to get their team to actually learn R.

*Help Your Team Learn R *is designed to help people in this situation by providing an introduction to some of the key concepts in the field of technical training.

## What’s in the Course?

In terms of Pedagogy, the course focuses on *Criterion Referenced Instruction*, which is the branch of training that I have found most useful when teaching R.

The course contains seven lessons that are sent via email over the course of six days. Each email contains:

- One key concept from the field of training

- An example of how I have applied that concept when I teach R

- An exercise to help you apply that concept to your own teaching


## Sign Up Now!
