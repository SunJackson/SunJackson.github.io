Drive impactful healthcare insightsfrom data
 


The explosive growth of health data has created great opportunities to improve the quality and delivery of patient care and a great need for professionals with the knowledge and skills to retrieve, interpret, and act on that data. Students in the Northwestern master's program in Health Analytics build in-depth data science expertise specifically for healthcare that can provide solutions and improve patient outcomes. 
 


Drawing on the strengths of partnerships with faculty and staff in Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, the program offers students the opportunity to learn in a hands-on, leading-edge program that is ideal for those with either clinical or quantitative backgrounds.
