|Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful automation tool. When applied to business intelligence (BI), it can dramatically accelerate insights, deepen understanding, and enhance decision making. But AI is a double-edge sword: without sufficient governance, it can deliver inaccurate or irrelevant insights that can lead to poor decisions. This webinar will help listeners understand both the opportunities and limits of AI for decision making. It will underscore the importance of applying appropriate governance and controls to analytic models and use cases.**Attendees will learn:**- How AI augments BI and improves decision making - The difference between AI for BI and automated machine learning - How AI augments data analysts, turning them into citizen data scientists- How a blend of man and machines delivers optimal decisions - How to apply suitable governance to AI processes**Speakers** |
