Many times, for instance when teaching, I needed to quickly and simply generate a **perfectly normally distributed sample** to illustrate or show some of its characteristics.

This is now very easy to do with the new `bayestestR` package, which includes the `rnorm_perfect` function. This function is very similar to the classic `rnorm` (same arguments), with the difference that the generated sample is *perfectly* normal.

## Example

`bayestestR` can be installed as follows:

```
install.packages("bayestestR") # Install the package
library(bayestestR) # Load it
```

```
# Generate a perfect sample
x <- rnorm_perfect(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Visualise it
library(tidyverse)

x %>% 
 density() %>% # Compute density function
 as.data.frame() %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
 geom_line()
```

We can also easily color some of the parts of the curve, for instance, the observations lying beyond +2 standard deviations.

```
x %>% 
 density() %>% # Compute density function
 as.data.frame() %>% 
 mutate(outlier = ifelse(x > 2, "Extreme", "Not extreme")) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y, fill=outlier)) +
 geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0, ymax=y)) +
 theme_classic()
```
