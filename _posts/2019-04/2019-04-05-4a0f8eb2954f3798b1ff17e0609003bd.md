**LanczOs Variance Estimates (LOVE)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
One of the most compelling features of Gaussian process (GP) regression is its ability to provide well calibrated posterior distributions. Recent advances in inducing point methods have drastically sped up marginal likelihood and posterior mean computations, leaving posterior covariance estimation and sampling as the remaining computational bottlenecks. In this paper we address this shortcoming by using the Lanczos decomposition algorithm to rapidly approximate the predictive covariance matrix. Our approach, which we refer to as LOVE (LanczOs Variance Estimates), substantially reduces the time and space complexity over any previous method. In practice, it can compute predictive covariances up to 2,000 times faster and draw samples 18,000 time faster than existing methods, all without sacrificing accuracy. … 

**Unstructured Semantic Model (USM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
With the rapid development of online advertising and recommendation systems, click-through rate prediction is expected to play an increasingly important role.Recently many DNN-based models which follow a similar Embedding&MLP paradigm have been proposed, and have achieved good result in image/voice and nlp fields.In these methods the Wide&Deep model announced by Google plays a key role.Most models first map large scale sparse input features into low-dimensional vectors which are transformed to fixed-length vectors, then concatenated together before being fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn non-linear relations among input features. The number of trainable variables normally grow dramatically the number of feature fields and the embedding dimension grow. It is a big challenge to get state-of-the-art result through training deep neural network and embedding together, which falls into local optimal or overfitting easily.In this paper, we propose an Unstructured Semantic Model (USM) to tackles this challenge by designing a orthogonal base convolution and pooling model which adaptively learn the multi-scale base semantic representation between features supervised by the click label.The output of USM are then used in the Wide&Deep for CTR prediction.Experiments on two public datasets as well as real Weibo production dataset with over 1 billion samples have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach with superior performance comparing to state-of-the-art methods. … 

**Linky** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
User identity linkage across online social networks is an emerging research topic that has attracted attention in recent years. Many user identity linkage methods have been proposed so far and most of them utilize user profile, content and network information to determine if two social media accounts belong to the same person. In most cases, user identity linkage methods are evaluated by performing some prediction tasks with the results presented using some overall accuracy measures. However, the methods are rarely compared at the individual user level where a predicted matched (or linked) pair of user identities from different online social networks can be visually compared in terms of user profile (e.g. username), content and network information. Such a comparison is critical to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method. In this work, we present Linky, a visual analytical tool which extracts the results from different user identity linkage methods performed on multiple online social networks and visualizes the user profiles, content and ego networks of the linked user identities. Linky is designed to help researchers to (a) inspect the linked user identities at the individual user level, (b) compare results returned by different user linkage methods, and (c) provide a preliminary empirical understanding on which aspects of the user identities, e.g. profile, content or network, contributed to the user identity linkage results. …
