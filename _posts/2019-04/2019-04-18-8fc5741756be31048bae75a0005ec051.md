**Neural Exploration-Exploitation Tree (NEXT)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Sampling-based algorithms such as RRT and its variants are powerful tools for path planning problems in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. While these algorithms perform systematic exploration of the state space, they do not fully exploit past planning experiences from similar environments. In this paper, we design a meta path planning algorithm, called \emph{Neural Exploration-Exploitation Trees} (NEXT), which can exploit past experience to drastically reduce the sample requirement for solving new path planning problems. More specifically, NEXT contains a novel neural architecture which can learn from experiences the dependency between task structures and promising path search directions. Then this learned prior is integrated with a UCB-type algorithm to achieve an online balance between \emph{exploration} and \emph{exploitation} when solving a new problem. Empirically, we show that NEXT can complete the planning tasks with very small searching trees and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on several benchmark problems. … 

**Inference Enterprise Model** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
An Inference enterprise is an entity within an organization that uses data, tools, people, and processes to make inferences about variables that are critical to the success of the organization. … 

**ATOMIC** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present ATOMIC, an atlas of everyday commonsense reasoning, organized through 300k textual descriptions. Compared to existing resources that center around taxonomic knowledge, ATOMIC focuses on inferential knowledge organized as typed if-then relations with variables (e.g., ‘if X pays Y a compliment, then Y will likely return the compliment’). We propose nine if-then relation types to distinguish causes v.s. effects, agents v.s. themes, voluntary v.s. involuntary events, and actions v.s. mental states. By generatively training on the rich inferential knowledge described in ATOMIC, we show that neural models can acquire simple commonsense capabilities and reason about previously unseen events. Experimental results demonstrate that multitask models that incorporate the hierarchical structure of if-then relation types lead to more accurate inference compared to models trained in isolation, as measured by both automatic and human evaluation. …
