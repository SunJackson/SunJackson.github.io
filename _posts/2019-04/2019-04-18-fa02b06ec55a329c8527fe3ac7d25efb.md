The last *mlr* release was in August 2018 â€“ so it was definitely time for a new release after around 9 months of development!

The NEWS file can be found directly here.

In this post we highlight some of the new implementations that come along with this release of v2.14.0

## Resampling

You can now provide fully predefined indices in resampling.This is useful for datasets that have a certain grouping structure (e.g. spatial data) to maintain this grouping.

## mlr-org NEWS

You might be wondering what weâ€™ve been up to in the last months in our group.The major project that we started was mlr3.This is a clean rewrite of *mlr* with the concept of a modular structure aiming to simplify usage and maintenance of the â€œmlr ideaâ€� in the future, both for users and developers.We are not completely finished yet but you can take a look at the Github repo what we have achieved so far.Once we are ready to release the initial version, we will of course write a dedicated post about it.

Putting a lot of time into *mlr3* also lead to the fact of having less time for responding to issues and questions in *mlr*.We would like to apologize for this.All of us are working in academia and are not getting paid for *mlr*.So our resources are limited to some extent.We very welcome anyone that would like to help us and get involved into *mlr* or *mlr3*.Our team is not a closed group and anyone can contribute to the mlr-org projects.

This fact also lead to the most recent maintainer change of *mlr*.As Bernd Bischl (the creator and maintainer) of *mlr* has a lot of duties, we decided to make Lars Kotthoff and Patrick Schratz the new maintainers of the *mlr* package.

Due to the existence of *mlr3*, most development will go there and *mlr* is aimed to receive only bug fixes and some clean up in the near future.Right now, we have over 400 issues and 30 pull requests so there is a still a lot to do ğŸ™‚

## Roadmap for mlr

We are aiming at publishing new releases every three months from now on, regardless of the amount of changes.*mlr* will continue to exist next to *mlr3* and receive bug fixes.If users start contributing new features we are also happy to include those into the package.As announced already, we aim at cleaning up the *mlr* repo issue and pull request wise in the next months to be able to fully concentrate on *mlr3* after its initial release.
