We had published a web scraping tutoriala couple of days back and it had received a good response from the #rstats community. Whilewe thank you for that, we made a mistake in choosing one of the case study aspointed out by @hrbrmstr in this tweet:


We choose the case study to appeal to a wide audience but in doing so we seta bad example. We have removed the case study from our post and apologizeto the #rstats community for our oversight and promise to be more responsible in thefuture.

**We reiterate it is very important to read the terms and conditions before scraping data froma website and checking the robots.txt file is not sufficient**.
