In South Africa, the first AIDS-related death occurred in 1985. Not all patients were eligible to receive ARVs, and it was only in 2004 that ARVs became available in the public sector in South Africa. Eligibility restriction still applied, so not all HIV infected patients received treatment.

Ideally, a country would have all its HIV-infected people on treatment, but due to financial constraints, this is not always possible. In South Africa, patients were only initialized on ARVs when their CD4 counts dropped below a certain level. This threshold was initially 200 cells/mL in 2004, which was then changed to 350 cells/mL and 500 cell/mL at later intervals. These recommendations were a compromise between the availability of funds and getting ARVs to the people needing it the most. CD4 cells are a major component of the immune system; the lower the CD4 cell count the higher the chance for opportunistic infections. Thus, the idea is to support the patients who are most likely to contract an opportunistic infection.

The problem with this was that about only a third of the HIV infected people in South Africa were receiving HAART treatment. In 2017, the guidelines changed to test and treat; i.e., any newly diagnosed patient will receive HAART treatment. This is a big improvement for many reasons, but notably a lower infection rate. If a patient is taking HAART treatment and it is effective in suppressing the viral replication, the chances of the patient transmitting the virus are very close to zero.

However, these treatments are not without side effects, which in some cases causes very poor adherence to the treatment. There are numerous factors to blame here, specifically socio-economic factors and depression. There is also ignorance and the “fear of knowing”, which causes people not to know their status. Finally, human nature brings with it various other complexities, such as conspiracy theories, and religious and personal beliefs. This will be a very long post if we delve into all the issues, but the take-home message is: the situation is complicated.

### ARV coverage by country

We looked at the rate of HIV infections, and also the number of people infected, in the most endemic countries. We have talked about treatment. It would be interesting to look at ARV coverage by country.

Let’s see how these countries rank by ARV coverage:

```
arv_dat %>%
 na.omit(PersCov) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Country, PersCov), y = PersCov)) +
 geom_point(aes(colour = NumberInfected), size = 3) +
 scale_colour_viridis(
 name = "Number of people infected", 
 trans = "log10",
 option = "plasma"
 ) +
 coord_flip() +
 ylab("% ARV coverage") + xlab("Country") +
 theme_bw()
```

This shows that Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, and Rwanda have the highest ARV coverage (above 80%). South Africa has the highest number of infections (as we saw before), and coverage of just above 60%.

Botswana rolled out their treatment program in 2002, and by mid-2005, about half of the eligible population received ARV treatment. South Africa, on the other hand, only started treatment in 2004, which we discuss later.

When talking about treatment, we should also look at the changes in mortality.

### HIV related deaths

Read in the data:

```
hiv_mort <- 
 read_csv(file.path(file_path, "HIV deaths.csv"), col_types = "ccccc") %>% 
 na_if("No data") %>% 
 mutate_at(vars(starts_with("Deaths")), clean_column) %>% 
 filter(Country %in% sub_sahara)

head(hiv_mort)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 5
## Country Deaths_2017 Deaths_2010 Deaths_2005 Deaths_2000
## 
## 1 Angola 13000 10000 7900 3900
## 2 Benin 2500 2600 4300 2600
## 3 Botswana 4100 5900 13000 15000
## 4 Burkina Faso 2900 5400 12000 15000
## 5 Burundi 1700 5400 8600 8500
## 6 Cameroon 24000 25000 26000 17000
```

```
summary(hiv_mort)
```

```

## Median : 6500 
## Mean : 26496 
## 3rd Qu.: 41500 
## Max. :130000 
## NA's :3
```

The 2017 mean for the dataset as a whole is about half of that during the early 2000s. It would be interesting to plot this data, but it will probably be too busy as it is. We can instead have a look at countries which had the most change.

```
hiv_mort <- hiv_mort %>% 
 mutate(
 min = apply(hiv_mort[, 2:4], 1, FUN = min),
 max = apply(hiv_mort[, 2:4], 1, FUN = max),
 Change = max - min
 )
```

Next, we can create a plot of the data, and look at the top five countries with the biggest change in HIV-related mortality.

```
hiv_mort %>%
 top_n(5, wt = Change) %>%
 gather(Year, Deaths, Deaths_2017:Deaths_2000) %>% 
 na.omit() %>%
 mutate(
 Year = str_replace(Year, "Deaths_", "") %>% as.numeric(),
 Country = fct_reorder(Country, Deaths)
 ) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Deaths, color = Country)) +
 geom_line(size = 1) +
 geom_vline(xintercept = 2004, color = "black", linetype = "dotted", size = 1.5) +
 scale_color_viridis(option = "D", discrete = TRUE) +
 theme_bw() +
 theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```

Remember, we mentioned that **HAART** (Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment) was introduced in 2004 in South Africa, depicted here by the black dotted line. It is easy to appreciate the dramatic effect the introduction of ARVs had in South Africa.

Although the picture above is positive, the fight is not over. The target is to get at least 90% of HIV-infected patients on treatment. Adherence to ARV regimens stays crucial not only to suppress viral replication, but also to minimize the development of drug resistance.

### Infection rates

As mentioned earlier, if a patient is taking and responding to treatment, the viral load gets suppressed and the chances of transmitting the infection become very close to null. Thus, the more patients with an undetectable viral load, the lower the transmission rate.

Read the data:

```
new_infections <- 
 read_csv(file.path(file_path, 
 "Epidemic transition metrics_Trend of new HIV infections.csv"), 
 na = "...", 
 col_types = cols(
 .default = col_character(),
 `2017_1` = col_double()
 )
 ) %>% 
 select(
 -ends_with("_upper"), 
 -ends_with("lower"), 
 -ends_with("_1")
 ) %>% 
 mutate_at(-1, clean_column) %>%
 na.omit()
```

```
## Warning: Duplicated column names deduplicated: '2017' => '2017_1' [26]
```

```
new_infections %>% 
 gather(Year, NewInfections, 2:9) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = NewInfections, color = Country)) +
 geom_point() +
 theme_classic() +
 theme(legend.position = "none") +
 xlab("Year") + 
 ylab("Number of new infections")
```

This is a bit busy. Countries that are highly endemic with good ARV coverage and prevention of infection programs should have a steeper decline in the newly infected people. At first glance, it looks like some of the data points are fairly linear. Let’s go with that assumption, and apply linear regression to each country.

```
rates_modeled <- 
 new_infections %>% 
 filter(Country %in% sub_sahara) %>% 
 na.omit() %>% 
 gather(Year, NewInfections, 2:9) %>% 
 mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) %>% 
 group_by(Country) %>% 
 do(tidy(lm(NewInfections ~ Year, data = .))) %>% 
 filter(term == "Year") %>% 
 ungroup() %>% 
 mutate(
 Country = fct_reorder(Country, estimate, .desc = TRUE)
 ) %>% 
 arrange(desc(estimate)) %>% 
 select(-one_of("term", "statistic"))

rates_modeled %>% 
 head() %>% 
 kable(
 caption = "Results of linear regression: Rate of new infections per year"
 )
```

 ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = estimate, fill = p.value >= 0.05)) +

With a quick look at the plot shown above, we can see that for most countries, a linear model fits the data with a significant p-value cutoff of 0.05.

It is important to note here that the data we have at hand is from 2010 to 2017. This shows that some countries – notably, South Africa – are on a good trajectory. Botswana, being the “Poster Child” of a good HIV treatment and prevention program, seems to have stabilized in terms of rate of infection, with a positive but insignificant estimate of the rate of infection. This could be explained by the following reasons:

- First African country to introduce HAART, 2002

- Progressive in terms of prevention programs

- Looking only from 2010, we are missing the dramatic decline in infection

- The WHO goal is to get 90% of a country’s infected people on HAART, but the last 5-7% might be the hardest to convince


We can combine the ARV and estimated rates of infection data.

```
arv_on_infection <- 
 arv_dat %>% 
 left_join(rates_modeled, by = "Country") %>% 
 mutate(p_interpretation = if_else(p.value >= 0.05, "Significant", "Insignificant"))
```

```
## Warning: Column `Country` joining character vector and factor, coercing
## into character vector

```
arv_on_infection %>% 
 na.omit() %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = PersCov, y = estimate, 
 shape = p_interpretation >= 0.05)) +
 geom_point(aes(color = NumberInfected), size = 2) +
 geom_text_repel(aes(label = Country), size = 3) +
 scale_color_gradient(high = "red", low = "blue") +
 theme_grey() +
 xlab("% ARV coverage") + 
 ylab("Estimated change in HIV infection\n(people/year)") +
 ggtitle("Antiretroviral (ARV) coverage")
```

South Africa has the highest number of infected people, but on the positive side, has a downward trajectory of about 15000 fewer people newly infected each year. Although ARVs do play a crucial role in controlling this epidemic, it is not the only factor involved. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been very successful in South Africa. Awareness campaigns and education are playing a big role as well. The plot above shows our linearly modeled rates.
