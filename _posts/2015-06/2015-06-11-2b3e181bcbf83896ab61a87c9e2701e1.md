[CVPR 2015](http://www.pamitc.org/cvpr15), "Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition" is the main conference of the computer vision community and just
finished.
I unfortunately was only able to stay for the three main conference days, but
here is my short subjective summary.

For an overview of individual research papers, see this excellent summary
page by Andrej
Karpathy.

From the papers I have seen at the conference my personal favorite is Barron
et al., "Fast Bilateral-Space Stereo for Synthetic Defocus",
[PDF here](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Barron_Fast_Bilateral-Space_Stereo_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf).
I liked it for a number of reasons. First, this research is already
successfully productized in a high-profile product and the presentation of the
work was excellent. Second, the flavour of this work is to take a data
structure (the permutohedral lattice) which has been used for one problem
successfully (bilateral filtering), and use it to solve a more difficult
problem (disparity from stereo) within the domain of the data structure. This
general idea may be useful in other contexts. To admit the truth, I never
liked pixels as a representation of image data, and many statistical models
are just awkward to specify on the pixel level; for this reason we as a
community often use higher representations such as superpixels or region
proposals. This paper provides an alternative method on how a regular
representation that is more aligned with the semantic content of the image
could be used to solve problems in such a way that one can reconstruct a
solution on the pixel level.

## Research Trends

**Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks**. Since the seminal ECCV
 2012 workshop presentation by Alex
 Krizhevsky that announced the ImageNet
 results and was published as a NIPS paper the same
 year the
 computer vision community has rapidly adopted convolutional networks and
 some of the largest vision labs developed toolkits that democratized this
 technology, such as [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), and existing
 toolkits such as [Torch](http://torch.ch/), and
 [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano) are also used.
 In effect, I estimate that around 30 percent of all papers used
 convolutional networks or features derived from them in their work, often
 substantially increasing predictive performance on the given task.
 Significant research directions remain open to everyone, but it is fair to
 say that standard convnets are now a mature vision technology regularly used
 by large parts of the community.
**Rich Linguistic Outputs**. Automatic image captioning is now feasible.
 There is an excellent
 summary of the
 may works at [Piotr Dollar's blog](https://pdollar.wordpress.com/.) and also
 in another summary by John
 Platt.
 Many of these works are enabled by the recent
 [Microsoft COCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/) and by recurrent neural
 networks.

## Non-Research Trends and the IEEE Controversy

**Growth in attendance**. Attendance was at more than 2,400 persons,
 continuing the rapid growth of the computer vision community.
**More code published**. On almost every second poster there was a
 [github](http://github.com/) URL and the licenses are generally very liberal
 (MIT, BSD, etc.) so as to permit wide distribution; this is great as it
 further accelerates the speed at which efforts can be redirected towards
 promising approaches.
**IEEE splits from CVPR**. The conference has always been organized in part
 by [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) in various capacities as an insurer,
 organizer, and publisher. However, with traditional publishing models being
 obsoleted, and with examples of independent conferences and journals in the
 machine learning community ([NIPS](http://nips.cc/),
 [ICML](http://icml.cc/), and [JMLR](http://jmlr.org/)), and considering that
 CVPR as one of the premier conferences in all of computer science, the power
 balance has shifted away from IEEE towards the computer vision community; as
 a result, over the last few years the ties with IEEE have been weakened and
 now seem to be lost. To be fair, following CVPR 2011, IEEE has moved and
 negotiated a fairer deal, with CVPR papers made available
 [open-access](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess) since
 CVPR 2013, and allowing co-sponsoring arrangements with the
 [Computer Vision Foundation](http://www.cv-foundation.org/).
 But now, after threats made by IEEE, it has been voted at the PAMI-TC
 meeting that future CVPR conferences (starting with CVPR 2016) that the
 computer vision foundation will take over the functions previously carried
 out by the IEEE. More details will be announced shortly, I am sure.
 Whether this has any repercussions for the
 [TPAMI journal](http://www.computer.org/web/tpami) is unclear at the current
 point, but before making threats and actions that would serve as a catalyst
 for community action, IEEE would be wise to consider what has happened to Springer's
 *Machine Learning* journal in 2001 and the events that led to the founding
 of the Journal of Machine Learning
 Research,
 a very successful
 experiment.
