I’m raising money for Cancer Research. I’m going to be climbing the Seattle Space Needle.

Early in October, for the first time in history, members of the public are being allowed to climb up the internal emergency stairs that form the spine of the needle, for one special day. All participants agree to raise money for cancer research.

Please consider sponsoring me. 100% of your donation will go directly to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research institute.

I write my blog for free, and have many thousands of readers; if each of you simply donates the equivalent of your next latté, then I will raise thousands of dollars for this great cause. Sure, give more if you can, but even just a couple of dollars will help a great cause. You can make your donation anonymously, or you can share a message about someone you love who has been touched by cancer.

I’m climbing in memory of my late brother and mother; both of whom passed to cancer before their times. My brother was only sixteen years old.

If you’ve enjoyed reading my blog over the years, please considering sending a couple of dollars. This will be my one and only request for sponsorship on this event. Normal blog service will return next week.
