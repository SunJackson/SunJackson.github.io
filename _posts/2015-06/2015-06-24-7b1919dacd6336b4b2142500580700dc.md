## Why this #openimpact marathon?

These projects just deserve it. They are innovative and they make sense. They are beacons for anyone who cares about using data for the greater good.

Why ten weeks? We have a deadline for presenting the results of the marathon to a jury of a [TEDx competition](http://datanauts.tedxrheinmain.de/). We want to win a TEDx talk and tell a story: If we all work together to reach *X* replications of *Y* projects in ten weeks, imagine how many projects and their impact can be replicated in a year! DataLook won’t stop after the ten weeks. The first replications will just seed the process. We will refine the framework and use it to present projects on [datalook.io](http://datalook.io/). Ultimately, more projects will be replicated more easily and thus more often, furthering impact.

## What is it?

[DataLook](http://datalook.io/) is a directory of reusable data-driven projects for social good (see who we are [here](http://datalook.io/about#team)).  Each project starts with a suboptimal condition in a community and the desire to effect change on it by innovatively using data. We are a non-profit project on a mission to encourage and simplify the replication of such projects. Over the past year we have been collecting 250+ projects on [datalook.io](http://datalook.io/). Now, it’s time to select the ones that stand out. We have curated a [shortlist](http://blog.datalook.io/openimpact) of the most impressive reusable projects. Their impact can and should be multiplied. Let’s work together and bring these projects to more communities. Let’s do the #openimpact replication marathon.

## Is replication feasible?

Oh yeah! Ten weeks sounds short, but some of the projects can be replicated within a day if all the ingredients are present. Other projects require more time, but the replication process can be started immediately. To make replication easier in the future DataLook will be building a replication framework during the #openimpact marathon — think of it as recipe model that structures information and enables you to cook a delicious dish. Read more about the first version of the replication framework [here](http://blog.datalook.io/replication-framework). We want to learn from your feedback and gradually improve the framework.

Replication needs the definition of open: our site is based on the open source app [Telescope](http://telescopeapp.org/), our customization is [open source](https://github.com/jshimko/telescope-datalook) and our data is [openly accessible](http://datalook.io/api). The European Commission promotes the open idea and we are supported until October by [SpeedUP Europe](http://speedupeurope.eu/), one of the [FIWARE accelerators](https://www.fiware.org/accelerators).

## What next?
