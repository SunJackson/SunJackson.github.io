This August, I will be hosting the Carnival of Mathematics. The Carnival is a rotating blog hosted by a different site each month, coordinated by [The Aperiodical](http://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/).

The carnival is an excellent idea and provides a great mechanism for cross-pollination between bloggers with similar geeky interests. You can find examples of previous episodes using the link above.
