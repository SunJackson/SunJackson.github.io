I just bought [Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393254291) and discovered that it mentions my blog – in particular the post [When machine learning matters](https://erikbern.com/2016/08/05/when-machine-learning-matters.html).

Ok, I lied a little bit. I didn’t discover it serendipitously. Someone actually emailed me saying I was mentioned, and so I ordered the book for same-day delivery. But I was seriously planning to read the book anyway – having read both [The Second Machine Age](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies/dp/0393350649) and [Rage Against the Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-Machine-Accelerating-Productivity/dp/0984725113) – they are great books *and I’m not being biased*.

What’s next? Hoping my blog will be mentioned in a Broadway musical in a few years.

As a complete side note, Erik Brynjolfsson has a conspicuously similar name to mine. Just for fun, I computed the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of my name against every Wikipedia article. [Erik Brynjolfsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Brynjolfsson) has distance 6, and as it turns out is the closest one *out of all Wikipedia articles.* Now you know!
