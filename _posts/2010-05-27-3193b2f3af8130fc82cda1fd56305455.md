It is now possible (using the development version as of may 2010) to use
Support Vector Machines with custom kernels in scikits.learn. How to use
it couldn't be more simple: you just pass a callable (the kernel) to the
class constructor). For example, a linear kernel would be implemented as
follows: [cc lang="python"] import numpy as np def my_kernel(x, y):
return np.dot(x, y.T) [/cc] The only requisites for defining a kernel is
that it should take as argument two numpy arrays and return also a numpy
array. Then you would pass the kernel to the classifier's constructor:
[cc lang="python"] from scikits.learn import svm clf =
svm.SVC(kernel=my_kernel) [/cc] and that's all. The construct
recognizes this as a custom kernel and you can then use the classifier
as any other classifier. [cc lang="python"] clf.fit([[0, 0], [1, 1]],
[0, 1]) print clf.predict([[0, 0]]) --> [0.] [/cc] For a complete
reference, see the [the reference manual](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/modules/svm.html#using-custom-kernels) and [an example](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/auto_examples/svm/plot_custom_kernel.html#example-svm-plot-custom-kernel-py).
