Recently I've implemented, together with [Arnaud Rachez](http://arachez.com/), the SAGA[] algorithm in the [lightning](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/lightning) machine learning library (which by the way, has been recently moved to the new [scikit-learn-contrib](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib) project). The lightning library uses the same API as scikit-learn but is particularly adapted to online learning. As for the SAGA algorithm, its performance is similar to other variance-reduced stochastic algorithms such as SAG[] or SVRG[] but it has the advantage with respect to SAG[] that it allows non-smooth penalty terms (such as $\ell_1$ regularization). It is implemented in lightning as [SAGAClassifier](http://scikit-learn-contrib.github.io/lightning/generated/lightning.classification.SAGAClassifier.html) and [SAGARegressor](http://scikit-learn-contrib.github.io/lightning/generated/lightning.regression.SAGARegressor.html).

We have taken care to make this implementation as efficient as possible. As for most stochastic gradient algorithms, a naive implementation takes 3 lines of code and is straightforward to implement. However, there are many tricks that are time-consuming and error-prone to implement but make a huge difference in efficiency.

A small example, more as a sanity check than to claim anything. The following plot shows the suboptimality as a function of time for three similar methods: SAG, SAGA and SVRG. The dataset used in the RCV1 dataset (test set, obtained from the [libsvm webpage](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html)), consisting of 677.399 samples and 47.236 features. Interestingly, all methods can solve this rather large-scale problem within a few seconds. Within them, SAG and SAGA have a very similar performance and SVRG seems to be reasonably faster.
