**Date:** Thursday 17 March 2016

**Time:** 5:30pm-6:30pm

**Venue:** The Diamond, 32 Leavygreave Road, Sheffield, S3 7RD (Lecture Theatre 5)

**Audience:** All Ages

The talk will be on the themes in this blog post.

**Summary**: The media is full of concerns about our data and how algorithms are affecting us. We worry about personal information becoming public, we worry about what intelligent machines have in store for us. This talk will be about the state of the art in terms of Artificial Intelligence. It will consider what it can do and what it can’t do. We are a long way away from implementing a ‘sentient intelligence’, but what do we have in its place? We will explore current technology and speculate on what futures it may lead to.
