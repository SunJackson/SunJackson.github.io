For some time now I've been missing a function in scipy that exploits
the triangular structure of a matrix to efficiently solve the associated
system, so I decided to [implement it](http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/changeset/6844) by binding the LAPACK method
"trtrs", which also checks for singularities and is capable handling
several right-hand sides. Contrary to what I expected, binding Fortran
code with f2py is pretty straightforward, even for someone like me who
has never programmed in that language: I took a similar example,
modified it's parameters and it worked! Also, thanks to Pauli Virtanen
the review process was really fast and the patch was committed within a
few hours. The high level interface for LAPACK's trtrs is
linalg.solve_triangular, which accepts roughly the same arguments as
linalg.solve, but assumes the first argument is a triangular matrix: [cc
lang="python"] In [1]: from scipy import linalg In [2]:
linalg.solve_triangular([[1, 1], [0, 1]], [0, 1]) Out[2]: array([-1.,
1.]) [/cc] Simple [benchmarks](http://gist.github.com/654407) lets us clearly appreciate the
complexity gap between both methods : solving an (n, n) triangular
system is an O(n^2) operation, while solving a full one is at least a
O(n^3):
