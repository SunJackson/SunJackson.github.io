**Average Causal Effect (ACE)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The average causal effect (ACE) is defined as the average increase or decrease in value caused by the intervention. … 

**Multimodal Dynamic Timetable Model (Multimodal DTM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present multimodal DTM, a new model for multimodal journey planning in public (schedule-based) transport networks. Multimodal DTM constitutes an extension of the dynamic timetable model (DTM), developed originally for unimodal journey planning. Multimodal DTM exhibits a very fast query algorithm, meeting the request for real-time response to best journey queries and an extremely fast update algorithm for updating the timetable information in case of delays. In particular, an experimental study on real-world metropolitan networks demonstrates that our methods compare favorably with other state-of-the-art approaches when public transport along with unrestricted w.r.t. departing time traveling (walking and electric vehicles) is considered. … 

**Trunc-Match** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Ranking functions return ranked lists of items, and users often interact with these items. How to evaluate ranking functions using historical interaction logs, also known as off-policy evaluation, is an important but challenging problem. The commonly used Inverse Propensity Scores (IPS) approaches work better for the single item case, but suffer from extremely low data efficiency for the ranked list case. In this paper, we study how to improve the data efficiency of IPS approaches in the offline comparison setting. We propose two approaches Trunc-match and Rand-interleaving for offline comparison using uniformly randomized data. We show that these methods can improve the data efficiency and also the comparison sensitivity based on one of the largest email search engines. …
