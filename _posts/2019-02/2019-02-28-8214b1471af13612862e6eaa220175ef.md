Recent work has shown that Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play an important role in the acceleration of Machine Learning applications. Initial specification of machine learning applications are often done using a high-level Python-oriented framework such as Tensorflow, followed by a manual translation to either C or RTL for synthesis using vendor tools. This manual translation step is time-consuming and requires expertise that limit the applicability of FPGAs in this important domain. In this paper, we present an open-source tool-flow that maps numerical computation models written in Tensorflow to synthesizable hardware. Unlike other tools, which are often constrained by a small number of inflexible templates, our flow uses Google’s XLA compiler which emits LLVM code directly from a Tensorflow specification. This LLVM code can then be used with a high-level synthesis tool to automatically generate hardware. We show that our flow allows users to generate Deep Neural Networks with very few lines of Python code. …

Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP applications. Latest research in this field has largely been divided into two major sub-fields. Learning representations is one sub-field and learning deeper models, both sequential and convolutional, which again connects back to the representation is the other side. We posit the idea that the stronger the representation is, the simpler classifier models are needed to achieve higher performance. In this paper we propose a completely novel direction to text classification research, wherein we convert text to a representation very similar to images, such that any deep network able to handle images is equally able to handle text. We take a deeper look at the representation of documents as an image and subsequently utilize very simple convolution based models taken as is from computer vision domain. This image can be cropped, re-scaled, re-sampled and augmented just like any other image to work with most of the state-of-the-art large convolution based models which have been designed to handle large image datasets. We show impressive results with some of the latest benchmarks in the related fields. We perform transfer learning experiments, both from text to text domain and also from image to text domain. We believe this is a paradigm shift from the way document understanding and text classification has been traditionally done, and will drive numerous novel research ideas in the community. … 

**Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
ONNX is a open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners. …
