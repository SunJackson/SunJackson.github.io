**Beyond the Data Lab: Advanced Analytics at Continental Tire**

For global companies like Continental, advanced analytics and artificial intelligence promise numerous applications and significant opportunities. But how can these be seized quickly by global organisations? Continental’s Tire division achieved this by working towards three targets in parallel: first, quickly building the right infrastructure that uses containerisation and automated machine learning; second, quick wins by bringing first use cases into production, starting with demand forecasting, supply chain and IoT; third, strengthening agile principles to enhance how both individual analytics projects and the overall organisation work. This talk will present in-depth our infrastructure, use cases, and agile approaches.

**Try Fast, Fail Fast & Adjust Fast: HP’s Philosophy Towards its Industry 4.0 Efforts**

Industry 4.0, though a buzzword, can be maddening to lots of companies. We believe HP Inc's Supplies Organization experience is no different. One of the key foundations that has enabled HP to achieve success is the philosophy of “Try Fast, Fail Fast & Adjust Fast”. This philosophy has enabled us to cope with uncertainties and unknowns that come with innovation. This presentation will share some of the critical instances of this philosophy along our journey towards developing Manufacturing Analytics in HP. It will showcase tries, failures and most importantly, how we regroup, learn & adjust to achieve success!

**Data Science Methods at Work in the Vodafone Network**

Examples for predictive analytics at work in the Vodafone Germany networks will be shown: from customer experience simulations and predictions as input for network capacity planning towards network problem predictions via time series. This will also include machine learning triggering real-time actions, and thus digitalizing and automating the network maintenance processes.
