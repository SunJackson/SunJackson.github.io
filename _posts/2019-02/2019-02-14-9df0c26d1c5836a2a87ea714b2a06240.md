## Big Changes for The Data Incubator

At The Data Incubator, we aim to be at the forefront of data science training. We stay on top of the news (and make it when we can). We ensure our students have access to all the latest tips, tricks and toys. And when we see an opportunity to improve our training opportunities, we jump at it. 

That’s why we’re pleased to announce that The Data Incubator is now a part of Pragmatic Institute!.

 

## So what does that mean?

The Data Incubator (TDI), the leading provider of data science education, has joined with Pragmatic Marketing, the authority on product management and marketing training, to become a single source for comprehensive business training for companies — Pragmatic Institute. 

Don’t worry, TDI will continue to provide private corporate training, our fellowship program, placement services and online training for data scientists. But with Pragmatic Institute, we will also be offering a new live, in person three-day course to teach business leaders how to integrate data science into their business models. And we’ll get to expand our hands-on training for data scientists across the country — and beyond!

And in the near future, data scientists will be able to add the soon-to-be-coveted Pragmatic Data Certification to their credentials as we continue to roll out new courses and training opportunities.

## What’s changing?

With this new partnership, we’ve got a lot of exciting things happening. As part of Pragmatic Institute, we’ll be able to provide more training on a broader spectrum of topics to more current and future data scientists, starting with The Business of Data Science.

**The Business of Data Science** is a 3-day course focused on the principles of data science, identifying the optimal (and most profitable) ways to use data science in you business, and integrating it into your business. If you want to learn how to make better business decisions using data, want to better lead your data science team or simply want to understand data science better, then this course is for you. 

This new course will debut in late **April, 2019**. But it isn’t the only new course we’re offering. Make sure you subscribe today to stay in-the-know on all the great data science courses we’ll be rolling out this year. 

 

## What’s staying the same?

For the most part, everything you’ve come to know and love about TDI is staying the same. There’s just going to be more of it. 

We’ll still be offering our incredibly popular, incredibly competitive Fellowship program, which will continue to provide the hands-on, real-world data science training top companies are looking for. And we’ll continue our placement services to pair the right data scientist with the right position in healthcare, finance, tech and more. Both of these will continue to function under the TDI name. 

Our online courses will still provide the same great information from the same great TDI data science instructors. And we’ll still offer onsite training for your employees so your entire team is on the same page. 

So most everything will still be the same. But now, as part of the Pragmatic Institute brand, we’ll be able to provide more of it on a larger scale, so we can help meet the growing demand for qualified, dedicated data scientists the world needs.
