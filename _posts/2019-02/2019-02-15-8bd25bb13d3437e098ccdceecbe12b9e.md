**DP-Thresholding** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the covariance matrix under differential privacy, where the underlying covariance matrix is assumed to be sparse and of high dimensions. We propose a new method, called DP-Thresholding, to achieve a non-trivial $\ell_2$-norm based error bound, which is significantly better than the existing ones from adding noise directly to the empirical covariance matrix. We also extend the $\ell_2$-norm based error bound to a general $\ell_w$-norm based one for any $1\leq w\leq \infty$, and show that they share the same upper bound asymptotically. Our approach can be easily extended to local differential privacy. Experiments on the synthetic datasets show consistent results with our theoretical claims. … 

**AresDB** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Released in November 2018, AresDB is an open source, real-time analytics engine that leverages an unconventional power source, graphics processing units (GPUs), to enable our analytics to grow at scale. An emerging tool for real-time analytics, GPU technology has advanced significantly over the years, making it a perfect fit for real-time computation and data processing in parallel. … 

**VieClus** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
It is common knowledge that there is no single best strategy for graph clustering, which justifies a plethora of existing approaches. In this paper, we present a general memetic algorithm, VieClus, to tackle the graph clustering problem. This algorithm can be adapted to optimize different objective functions. A key component of our contribution are natural recombine operators that employ ensemble clusterings as well as multi-level techniques. Lastly, we combine these techniques with a scalable communication protocol, producing a system that is able to compute high-quality solutions in a short amount of time. We instantiate our scheme with local search for modularity and show that our algorithm successfully improves or reproduces all entries of the 10th DIMACS implementation~challenge under consideration using a small amount of time. …
