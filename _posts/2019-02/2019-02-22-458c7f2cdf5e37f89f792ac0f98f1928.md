Another small RVowpalWabbit package update brings us version 0.0.13. And just like Rblpapi yesterday, we have a new RVowpalWabbit update to cope with staged installs which will be a new feature of R 3.6.0. No other changes were made No new code or features were added.

We should mention once more there is a newer, but not on CRAN, package rvw thanks to the excellent GSoC 2018 and beyond work by Ivan Pavlov (who was mentored by James and myself) so if you are into Vowpal Wabbit from R go check it out.

More information is on the RVowpalWabbit page. Issues and bugreports should go to the GitHub issue tracker.
