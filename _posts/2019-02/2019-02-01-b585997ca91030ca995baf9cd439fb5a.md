WHO growth chart for boys. The lines represent conditional quantile functions for different quantiles: of length given age and weight given age.

**Quantile regression** is a regression method for estimating these conditional quantile functions. Just as linear regression estimates the conditional mean function as a linear combination of the predictors, quantile regression estimates the conditional quantile function as a linear combination of the predictors.

**Quantile regression in R**

We can perform quantile regression in R easily with the `quantreg` package. I will demonstrate how to use it on the `mtcars` dataset. (For more details on the `quantreg` package, you can read the package’s vignette here.)

Let’s load our packages and data:

We can perform quantile regression using the `rq` function. We can specify a `tau` option which tells `rq` which conditional quantile we want. The default value for `tau` is 0.5 which corresponds to ***median regression***. Below, we fit a quantile regression of miles per gallon vs. car weight:

Printing the fitted object to the console gives some rudimentary information on the regression fit. We can use the `summary` function to get more information (just like we do for the `lm` function):

In the table above, the `lower bd` and `upper bd` columns represent the endpoints of confidence intervals for the model coefficients. There are a number of ways for these confidence intervals to be computed; this can be specified using the `se`option when invoking the `summary` function. The default value is `se="rank"`, with the other options being “iid”, “nid”, “ker”, “boot” and “BLB” (type `?summary.rq` for details). 

This next block of code plots the quantile regression line in blue and the linear regression line in red:

Median regression (i.e. 50th quantile regression) is sometimes preferred to linear regression because it is “robust to outliers”. The next plot illustrates this. We add two outliers to the data (colored in orange) and see how it affects our regressions. The dotted lines are the fits for the original data, while the solid lines are for the data with outliers. As before, red is for linear regression while blue is for quantile regression. See how the linear regression fit shifts a fair amount compared to the median regression fit (which barely moves!)?

As I mentioned before, the `tau` option tells `rq` which conditional quantile we want. What is interesting is that we can set `tau` to be a vector and `rq` will give us the fits for all those quantiles:

I don’t think there’s a clean one-liner to plot all the quantile fits at once. The following loop is one possible solution:

![](https://statisticaloddsandends.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/plot3.png?w=450&h=389&fit=584%2C389)


`rq` exhibits interesting behavior if `tau` is set to some value outside of ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&bg=ffffff&%23038;fg=333333&%23038;s=0)
: it gives solutions for ALL values of `tau` in ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&bg=ffffff&%23038;fg=333333&%23038;s=0)
![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&bg=ffffff&%23038;fg=333333&%23038;s=0)
! (It turns out that there are a finite number of them.)

One final note: `rq` also supports more complicated formula.
