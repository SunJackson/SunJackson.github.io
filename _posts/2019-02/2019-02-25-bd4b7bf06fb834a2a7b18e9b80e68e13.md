We are delighted to be launching our brand new Fellowship scheme, **NUAcT (Newcastle University Academic Track)**which offers five-year, well-resourced Fellowships, leading to faculty appointments. Beginning in 2019, we are recruiting 100 new Fellows over the next five years.

Newcastle University is a world-class research-intensive university, advancing knowledge, providing creative solutions and solving global problems. We believe that the major challenges of the future will be answered by teams that are diverse in career stage, career pathway, disciplinary background, experience and personal characteristics and that Newcastle University is ideally placed to build such teams. We are determined to be inclusive and we offer a supportive and welcoming environment to all of our staff.

We are looking to recruit a diverse cohort of investigators with the talent and motivation to become future research and academic leaders in their field. As a Fellow at Newcastle University, you will develop your career in exciting working environments, you will be provided with a high level of dedicated time for research, have the freedom to develop your research interests and gain access to our cutting-edge facilities. We are an anchor institution in a vibrant city and work closely with external partners, conducting research that benefits our region, our country and the world. Our international research is facilitated by having physical bases in four locations (Newcastle, London, Singapore and Malaysia).

**NUAcT (Data Science)**

Aligned with the Government’s plan for the future of healthcare [1], this specific post is associated with a new initiative recently launched at Newcastle University, to address the key Data Science and Biomedical challenges to enable a long-term vision of Preventive, Predictive, Personalised, Participatory, Precision medicine [2]. The program embraces a major paradigm shift in Health Care, moving away from a detect-and-cure approach and towards personalised interventions aimed at preventing chronic diseases and extending the wellness state in ageing individuals.

Underpinning this paradigm shift is an understanding of "Big Health Data”, from genomics data through traditional  digital biomarkers to Electronic Health Records. Extracting value out of this data requires a combination of Data Science and Biomedical Science expertise.

To address these challenges, we are bringing together the School of Computing (Data Science); the Institute of Genetic Medicine; the National Innovation Centre for Ageing; and the NIHR Innovation Observatory along with the Alan Turing Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence under its “Revolutionising Healthcare” programme [3].

**Who can apply?**

We are looking for applicants who have the potential to develop into independent research investigators. You must have a relevant PhD (or equivalent) and postdoctoral experience, a track record of high quality research, and be aspiring to apply for externally funded fellowships or other major grant awards.

For this post, the ideal candidate will have a background in applied Data Science, including Statistical Learning (inference and prediction) and more broadly Machine Learning, with a working knowledge of Data Engineering for Big Data Analytics, and ideally with relevant domain expertise in Metabolic Science, Human Genetics, and Systems Biology. They will be comfortable working as part of a multidisciplinary team with a strong focus on research impact.***What does the NUAcT programme offer?***

Five years' salary
Initial fixed term appointment with progression to an open-ended contract subject to formal review
Start-up costs and ongoing research expenses (up to £50k, subject to research programme needs)
Funding for a PhD student associated with the research project
Dedicated mentors with world class expertise and significant research management experience
The opportunity to join and participate in our world-class research centres
Extensive training opportunities including a bespoke personal development plan
Peer support from a cross disciplinary cohort of talented early career researchers
Support for mobility to work with external partners, including outside the UK and academia
Additional provision for career breaks and career break returners, full flexibility to incorporate job share and less-than-full-time working, and funds to overcome potential barriers to career development associated with protected characteristics

***Fostering equality, diversity and inclusion***

Newcastle University is committed to the development of a fully inclusive University community which recruits and retains staff and students from all sectors of society. We recognise the value and importance of developing diverse teams and particularly welcome applications from under-represented groups. We understand that individuals have different needs and will tailor our support package around these.

*The University holds a Silver Athena SWAN award recognising the advancement we have made in promoting gender equality and the career progression of women. We are members of the Stonewall Global Diversity Champion programme which recognises organisations that are committed to Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender (LGBT) equality across the world, we are members of the Business Disability Forum and we are currently in the process of joining the Race Equality  charter. Our NUAcT Fellows who identify with a particular group will be able to access support via one of our many networks within the University including NUWomen, the Parent network, Rainbow@NCL (LGBT network), the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) network and the Disability Interest Group (DIG).*For further information about this opportunity contact Paolo Missier paolo.missier@newcastle.ac.uk.
