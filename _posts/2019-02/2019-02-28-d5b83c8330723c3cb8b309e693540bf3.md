I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got a work-in-progress `drat`-ified CRAN-like repo for (eventually) all my packages over at `CINC`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCINC is not CRAN√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ and it also sounds like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsync√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ). This is in parallel with a co-location/migration of all my packages to SourceHut (just waiting for the sr.ht alpha API to be baked) and a self-hosted public Gitea instance. Everything will still be on that legacy social coding site y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all use but the ultimate goal is to have all installs be possible via the CINC repository (i.e. `install.packages()`) or via a `remotes::install_git()` install from this standalone or any social coding site.

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll eventually publish the workflow but the idea is to customize a `pkgdown` YAML file in each package repo so the navbar has links back to CINC and other pages (this will take some time as I seem to have made alot of little packages over the years) and then to add a package to the CINC repo:

The above processes helped shine a light on some bad README practices I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had and also about how to make it a bit easier (in the future) to install C[++]-backed packages. Speaking of READMEs, I also need to get all the README√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s updated to use either `install.packages()` from CINC or a `remotes` install from Gitea.

Another couple of goals are to possibly get binary package versions added (though that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going to be interesting orchestration exercise) and see if I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get some `notary`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 concepts implemented.

It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually been a fun mini-project since the `drat` part is a simple as `drat::insertPackage('PKG', '/path/to/cinc')` (*#ty Dirk!*) √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù though I need to think through some logic around maintaining Archive versions and also deleting packages which `drat` doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do yet but is also as simple as removing tarballs and running `tools::write_PACKAGES()`.

As an aside, I also `drat`-ified all our $WORK packages and made that repo work-internally-accessible via static S3 web hosting. At $0.023 USD per GB (per-month) for just hosting the objects and $0.0004 USD per 1,000 `GET` requests (plus minimal setup charges for SSL) it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super cheap and also super-easy to maintain. Drop a note in the comments if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re interested in more details of the S3 `drat` setup.

### FIN

After a few more weeks√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ baking period for the self-hosed Gitea and CINC sites will have all non-error web-logging disabled and error logs won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t save IP addresses or referrers (I welcome anyone who wants to third-party audit the `nginx` configs) since another goal is also to help folks not be a product for tech startups or giant, soulless, global multi-national companies with a history of being horrendously evil.

Be on the lookout for a full writeup with code in the coming weeks.

#### P.S.

For Safari-users on 10.14+ I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve made some tweaks to the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbatman mode√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ version of the site. If you do use Safari (*but√¢‚Ç¨¬¶why?!*) and have any issues with readability in √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdark mode√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ just drop a note in the comments and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll see what I can do.
