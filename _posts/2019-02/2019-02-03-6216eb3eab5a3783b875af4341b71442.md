This is gonna be a short post about a little trick Iâ€™ve been using while developing Shiny Apps. (Spoiler: nothing revolutionary) 

### A browser anywhere, anytime

The first thing to do is to insert an **action button, and a browser() in the observeEvent() watching this button**. This is a standard approach: at any time, you just press this button, and youâ€™re inside the Shiny Application â€” then, you can access the value of the reactiveValues and run the reactive elements, accessing the values they have at the moment youâ€™ve pressed the button.

This approach works, and itâ€™s robust. But hereâ€™s the issue: itâ€™s kind of cumbersome to add/remove or comment/uncomment this button when you want to show, make screenshots, or simply remove this button to have a full view of the app.

So hereâ€™s a little trick that uses JavaScript to hide the button, and show it using the JavaScript console from your web browser:

```
# Add to your UI: 
actionButton("browser", "browser"),
tags$script("$('#browser').hide();")
```

```
# Add to your server 
observeEvent(input$browser,{
 browser()
})
```

```
# And to show the button in your app, go 
# to your web browser, open the JS console, 
# And type:
$('#browser').show();
```

As said, nothing revolutionary here, just sharing a little trick ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&ssl=1)

Ps: donâ€™t forget to remove this button when youâ€™ll send the app to be deployed to production.
