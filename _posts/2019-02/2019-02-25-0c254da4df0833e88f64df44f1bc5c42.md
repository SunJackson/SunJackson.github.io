*The Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) is recruiting highly qualified Post-Docs/Research Scientists, at various levels of seniority, to join the Laboratory of Digital and Computational Demography.*

MPIDR is one of the leading demographic centers in the world. It is part of the Max Planck Society, a network of 84 institutes that form Germany's premier basic-research organization. Max Planck Institutes have an established record of world-class, foundational research in the sciences, technology, social sciences and the humanities. They offer a unique environment that combines the best aspects of an academic setting and a research laboratory.

The Lab of Digital and Computational Demography, headed by MPIDR Director Emilio Zagheni, is looking for candidates with a background in Demography, Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, Sociology, Geography, Applied Mathematics, Public Health, Public Policy, or related disciplines.

The successful candidate must have a PhD (or receive it soon) and is expected to conduct cutting-edge research that produces methodological advances in the field of Digital and Computational Demography and/or answers important questions in the following key substantive areas of demography: (i) Migration and mobility; (ii) generational and gender relationships; (iii) Environment and disease dynamics.

The growing Lab of Digital and Computational Demography intends to bring together methodologists (from areas like Statistics, Computer Science or Mathematical Demography) with experts in areas of Social Sciences (e.g., Sociology, Geography, Economics, etc.) in order to favor cross-pollination of ideas, to advance methods and theory, and to address pressing societal questions.

Examples of project areas relevant for the Lab include (but are not limited to):

Combining traditional data sources as well as those that emerge from the digitalization of our lives to study demographic processes, like migration, fertility, health and well-being, intergenerational relationships and gender disparities.
Developing innovative forms of data collection for demographic research (e.g., surveys via web and social media advertisement platforms, or data collected via sensors, tracking devices, mobile phone apps, or crowd-source approaches).
Developing simulation models of individual choices and population-level processes to produce new insights on demographic dynamics and advance population theory.
Evaluating the impact of the digitalization of our lives on demographic behavior and population processes.
Modeling, estimating and predicting the relationships between environmental change, demographic processes and disease dynamics.

Applications (in English) have to be submitted online via www.demogr.mpg.de/go/JobAd396185 and include the following documents:

Curriculum Vitae
- Letter of interest (Max 1 page)*Briefly state why you are interested in joining MPIDR, how MPIDR could foster your professional development and career trajectory, and in which ways your interests fit the research strengths of MPIDR.   *
