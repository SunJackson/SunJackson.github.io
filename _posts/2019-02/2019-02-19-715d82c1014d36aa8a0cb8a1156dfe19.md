#### A little backstory: R-lab in 2018

In January 2018 i joined MilanoR, a community dedicated to bring together local R-users, aiming to share knowledge, best practice and good times with everyone who wants to get involved, at all skill levels; you can know more about the project here.

Between all the event formats they experimented, the most interesting are the R-labs. An R-lab is a non-competitive workshop, where everyone works together through a common effort, be it the development of a Shiny dashboard, optimizing an existing one, or simply helping the main guest solving a business problem with R.

Cool, isn’t it? Check out some of the previous events on our blog!

During our January R-lab, we met Riccardo Rossi, computational biologist and bioinformatics facility manager at INGM.

Showing us the already existing medical guidelines to assess risks of obesity, type two diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health, he invited us to build a Shiny app to allow people to keep in check their health status, just by entering some key parameters, such as height, weight and age.
