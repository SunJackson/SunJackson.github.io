“As many organizations are now learning, it is very difficult to get any value out of large data sets without clear goals, employing sophisticated data science techniques (e.g., machine learning and algorithms) and the right data crunching and analytical technologies. Getting value from data requires special data science methods to differentiate signal from noise to extract meaning and requires special compute systems and power.” Michael Walker ( September 19, 2014 )
