This GitHub repository may be a bit out of date, having not been updated at all in the past 5 months, but given its wealth of quality links to other deep learning repositories I thought it was relevant enough to point out.

**Trending Deep Learning** is a collection of, well, trending deep learning GitHub repos "sorted by the number of stars gained on a specific day." Mahmoud Badry maintians the collection (or did), and also prepared the companion collection repo **Top Deep Learning** (note the swapping of "trending" for "top").

While you might want a fresher perspective on trending repos, Badry notes the search he performs to gather the leaderboard:

> 
Here's a list of top 100 deep learning Github trending repositories sorted by the number of stars gained on a specific day. The query that has been used with Github search API is:

`deep-learning OR CNN OR RNN OR "convolutional neural network" OR "recurrent neural network"`

Repositories with 50000 stars or more are excluded.


You can get a sense of the most recent updates of trending repos here:

For comparison, here are the most recent updates from Badry's **top** repo:

I found some things of interest here. Hopefully you do too.
