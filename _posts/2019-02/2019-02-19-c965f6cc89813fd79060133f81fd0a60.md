The Jupyter Project started in 2014 as an initiative towards interactive and scientific computing.

It included a Python kernel so that the user would have a new an interactive IDE to use Python.

It is based on the IPython computing environment. In 2015, support for R was also added with the IRkernel. This allows users to run kernels with R and Python.

### R Kernel Installation

 

If you are using Windows, the following method is fine. If you are using a Unix based machine (OSX or Linux), THE COMMANDS MUST BE RUN IN THE TERMINAL.

The best way is to install Anaconda which will automatically have an installation of Python, R and Jupyter Notebooks.

After Anaconda installation, open the Anaconda Prompt and type `install.packages(c(repr, IRdisplay, evaluate, crayon, pbdZMQ, devtools, uuid, digest), type=source)`. ***It is imperative that this command be done in the terminal to execute directly from R and not an IDE. ***
After Step 1, run `devtools::install_github(IRkernel/IRkernel)` and finally,` IRkernel::installspec(user=FALSE)`.
Go to the Anaconda Navigator and open Jupyter Notebook or type `jupyter notebook` in the Anaconda Prompt. Under *New* you should find an *R* kernel. Click on that to start running R in the Jupyter environment.

***A word of caution. Since installing Anaconda is the easiest and fastest way to have Jupyter Notebook installed, the R Version that Anaconda installs lags behind the latest release. You cannot update R in Anaconda the same way you would if you installed it separately from the R website. This is because all the programs in Anaconda is managed by the Conda package manager and Anaconda needs to update their default version of R before the users get to install it. So when running R in Jupyter Notebooks, some packages may not work (although this is rare) in the older version due to package updates happening more frequently than R updates.***
