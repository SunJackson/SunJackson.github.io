Setting up your Python environment for Machine Learning can be a tricky task. If you’ve never set up something like that before, you might spend hours fiddling with different commands trying to get the thing to work. But we just want to get right to the ML!

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a *stable* Python Machine Learning development environment. You’ll be able to get right down into the ML and never have to worry about installing packages ever again.

 

### (1) Set up Python 3 and Pip

 The first step is to install pip , a Python package manager:



Using pip, we’ll be able to install any Python package that’s indexed in the *Python Package Index** *with a simple `pip install *your_package*`* . *You’ll see soon how we use it to set up our *virtual environment *too.

Next, we’ll set Python 3 to be the default when running either the `pip` or `python` commands from command line. This makes using Python 3 easier and more convenient. If we didn’t do this, then if we wanted to use Python 3, we’d have to remember to type out `pip3` and `python3` every time!

To force Python 3 to be the default, we’re going to modify the `~/.bashrc` file. From the command line, execute the following command to view that file:



Scroll on down to the **# some more ls aliases**section and add the following line:



Save the file and reload your changes:



Boom! Python 3 is now your default Python! You can run it with a simple `python *your_program*`* *on the command line.

 

### (2) Create a virtual environment

 Now we’ll set up a *virtual environment*. In there, we’ll install all of the python packages that we need for Machine Learning.

We use virtual environments in order to separate our coding set ups. Imagine if at some point you wanted to do 2 different projects on your computer, which required different libraries of different versions. Having them all in the same working environment can be messy and you’ll likely run into the problem of conflicting library versions. Your ML code for project 1 needs version 1.0 of `numpy`, but project 2 needs version 1.15. Yikes!

A virtual environment allows us to isolate our working areas to avoid those conflicts.

First, install the relevant packages:



Once we have virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper installed, we’ll again need to edit our `~/.bashrc` file. Place these 3 lines right at the bottom and save it.



Save the file and reload your changes:



Great! Now we can finally create our virtual environment like so:



We’ve just created a virtual environment called `ml` . To enter it, do this:



Nice! Any library installations that you do while in the `ml` virtualenv will be isolated in there and never conflict with any other environments! So whenever you wish to run code that depends on libraries installed in the `ml`environment, enter into first with the `workon` command and then run your code as normal.

If you need to exit the virtualenv, run this command:

 

### (3) Install Machine Learning libraries

 Now we can install our ML libraries! We’ll go with the most commonly used ones:

**numpy:** for any work with matrices, especially math operations
**scipy:** scientific and technical computing
**pandas:** data handling, manipulation, and analysis
**matplotlib:** data visualisation
**scikit learn:** machine learning

Here’s a simple trick to install all of those libraries in one quick shot! Create a `requirements.txt` file and list all of the packages you wish to install like so:



Once that’s done, just execute this command:



Voila! Pip will go ahead and install all of the packages listed in the file in one shot.

Congratulations, your environment is set up and you’re ready to do Machine Learning!
