Last night I spoke at Pivigo’s Business, Analytics and Data Science meetup (thanks for having me!). I spoke on the key points that I cover in my public training (Successfully Delivering Data Science Projects) aimed at the meetup’s audience where many folk are earlier on their data science journey.

We covered:

- Building a Project Specification

- Improving your coding and project process

- How your team’s process will improve if you *contribute* to open source projects rather than just consuming them

- Python tools that will make your life easier


The slides are linked here. Various folk last night asked me about how they get their first data science job and we had some good conversations. I have a “jobs and thoughts” list with UK-based jobs, if you’re after a role in the UK then you might want to jump on this list (your email is never shared and it is always kept private).
