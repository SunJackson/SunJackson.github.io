In many organizations, we find that R is already being used internally byindividual data scientists and analysts for productive work on their desktops.For other organizations, R has been chosen as a standard for analytics and datascience, but a process of exploration is necessary to understand what adoptionof open source software looks like in the enterprise.

In all cases, we recommend users showcase our full server-side products to showhow R can be useful across a team or department, rather than on a single user’smachine. Furthermore, this process integrates R into an organization’s IT practicesand secures it as an analytic standard. The QuickStart is a great first steptowards this objective because it is free, easy, and comes pre-populated withsome of the most common workflows that we see in enterprise use of our software.
