`R` users have been enjoying the benefits of `SQL` query generators for quite some time, most notably using the `dbplyr` package. I would like to talk about some features of our own `rquery` query generator, concentrating on derived result re-use.



## Introduction

`SQL` represents value use by nesting. To use a query result within another query one writes the query to be used inside the query using the values. `R` query generators can also represent value use by nesting, but they also tend to expose a sequential pipe notation where value use is represented by sequencing.

We will demonstrate this with an example.

```
library("rquery")

raw_connection <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), 
 ":memory:")

db_rquery <- rquery_db_info(
 connection = raw_connection,
 is_dbi = TRUE,
 connection_options = rq_connection_tests(raw_connection))

d <- data.frame(x = -3:3)

d0 <- rq_copy_to(db_rquery, "d", d)
print(d0)
```

```
## [1] "table(`d`; x)"
```

```
ops <- d0 %.>%
 extend(., y = x^2 -1) %.>%
 select_rows(., x > y)

cat(format(ops))
```

```
## table(`d`; 
## x) %.>%
## extend(.,
## y := x ^ 2 - 1) %.>%
## select_rows(.,
## x > y)
```

Notice how in the `rquery` operation we write operations one after another (using the dot-arrow pipe notation), and the operations are similarly printed.

Whereas the generated `SQL` is written in a nested format.

```
cat(to_sql(ops, db_rquery))
```

```
## SELECT * FROM (
## SELECT
## `x`,
## POWER ( `x` , 2 ) - 1 AS `y`
## FROM (
## SELECT
## `x`
## FROM
## `d`
## ) tsql_38280614414821583912_0000000000
## ) tsql_38280614414821583912_0000000001
## WHERE `x` > `y`
```

Notice the database handle is kept separate from the operators. Furthermore execution is not entangled with operator definition, but is a separate step (performed through `materialze()`, `execute()` or even sending the query to the database via a pipe).

```
ops %.>%
 db_rquery %.>%
 knitr::kable(.)
```

## Re-using derived values

The piped operator notation runs into trouble if we re-use derived values. `SQL` can re-use tables and views, but can not conveniently re-use queries. So if use query results more than once the notation expands our directed acyclic graph specification into a possibly much larger tree.

The following is an artificial example to demonstrate the issue.

```
d1 <- natural_join(d0, d0, 
d2 <- natural_join(d1, d1, 
d3 <- natural_join(d2, d2, 
 by = "x", jointype = "LEFT")

cat(format(d3))
```

```
## table(`d`; 
## x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x),
## j= LEFT, by= x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x),
## j= LEFT, by= x),
## j= LEFT, by= x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x),
## j= LEFT, by= x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x) %.>%
## natural_join(.,
## table(`d`; 
## x),
## j= LEFT, by= x),
## j= LEFT, by= x),
## j= LEFT, by= x)
```

Notice the depth 3 expression exploded into tree with 7 joins.

`rquery`‘s query diagrammer can help spot and diagnose these issues.

```
d3 %.>%
 op_diagram(., merge_tables = TRUE) %.>% 
 DiagrammeR::grViz(.) %.>%
 DiagrammeRsvg::export_svg(.) %.>%
 write(., file="query_growth_diagram.svg")
```

```
## Warning in op_diagram(., merge_tables = TRUE): possible repeated calculation:
## natural_join(.1, .2, j= LEFT, by= x)
```
