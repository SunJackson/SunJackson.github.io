The in-dev `htmlunit` package for javascript-â€œenabledâ€� web-scraping without the need for Selenium, Splash or headless Chrome relies on the HtmlUnit library and said library just released version 2.34.0 with a wide array of changes that should make it possible to scrape more gnarly javascript-â€œenabledâ€� sites. The Chrome emulation is now also on-par with Chrome 72 series (my Chrome beta is at 73.0.3683.56 so itâ€™s super close to very current).

In reality, the update was to the `htmlunitjars` package where the main project JAR and dependent JARs all received a refresh.

The README and tests were all re-run on both packages and Travis is happy.

If youâ€™ve got a working `rJava` installation (aye, itâ€™s 2019 and thatâ€™s still â€œa thingâ€�) then you can just do:

```
install.packages(c("htmlunitjars", "htmlunit"), repos = "https://cinc.rud.is/")

```

to get them installed and start playing with the DSL or work directly with the Java classes.
