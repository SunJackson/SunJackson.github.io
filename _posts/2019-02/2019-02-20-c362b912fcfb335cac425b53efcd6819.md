**Contrastive Variational Autoencoder Enhances Salient Features**

Variational autoencoders are powerful algorithms for identifying dominant latent structure in a single dataset. In many applications, however, we are interested in modeling latent structure and variation that are enriched in a target dataset compared to some background—e.g. enriched in patients compared to the general population. Contrastive learning is a principled framework to capture such enriched variation between the target and background, but state-of-the-art contrastive methods are limited to linear models. In this paper, we introduce the contrastive variational autoencoder (cVAE), which combines the benefits of contrastive learning with the power of deep generative models. The cVAE is designed to identify and enhance salient latent features. The cVAE is trained on two related but unpaired datasets, one of which has minimal contribution from the salient latent features. The cVAE explicitly models latent features that are shared between the datasets, as well as those that are enriched in one dataset relative to the other, which allows the algorithm to isolate and enhance the salient latent features. The algorithm is straightforward to implement, has a similar run-time to the standard VAE, and is robust to noise and dataset purity. We conduct experiments across diverse types of data, including gene expression and facial images, showing that the cVAE effectively uncovers latent structure that is salient in a particular analysis.

**Security-Aware Synthesis Using Delayed-Action Games**

Stochastic multiplayer games (SMGs) have gained attention in the field of strategy synthesis for multi-agent reactive systems. However, standard SMGs are limited to modeling systems where all agents have full knowledge of the state of the game. In this paper, we introduce delayed-action games (DAGs) formalism that simulates hidden-information games (HIGs) as SMGs, by eliminating hidden information by delaying a player’s actions. The elimination of hidden information enables the usage of SMG off-the-shelf model checkers to implement HIGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a DAG can be decomposed into a number of independent subgames. Since each subgame can be independently explored, parallel computation can be utilized to reduce the model checking time, while alleviating the state space explosion problem that SMGs are notorious for. In addition, we propose a DAG-based framework for strategy synthesis and analysis. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of the DAG-based synthesis framework on a case study of a human-on-the-loop unmanned-aerial vehicle system that may be under stealthy attack, where the proposed framework is used to formally model, analyze and synthesize security-aware strategies for the system.

**Extreme Tensoring for Low-Memory Preconditioning**

State-of-the-art models are now trained with billions of parameters, reaching hardware limits in terms of memory consumption. This has created a recent demand for memory-efficient optimizers. To this end, we investigate the limits and performance tradeoffs of memory-efficient adaptively preconditioned gradient methods. We propose extreme tensoring for high-dimensional stochastic optimization, showing that an optimizer needs very little memory to benefit from adaptive preconditioning. Our technique applies to arbitrary models (not necessarily with tensor-shaped parameters), and is accompanied by regret and convergence guarantees, which shed light on the tradeoffs between preconditioner quality and expressivity. On a large-scale NLP model, we reduce the optimizer memory overhead by three orders of magnitude, without degrading performance.

**Learning Theory and Support Vector Machines – a primer**

The main goal of statistical learning theory is to provide a fundamental framework for the problem of decision making and model construction based on sets of data. Here, we present a brief introduction to the fundamentals of statistical learning theory, in particular the difference between empirical and structural risk minimization, including one of its most prominent implementations, i.e. the Support Vector Machine.

**Weighted Tensor Completion for Time-Series Causal Information**

Marginal Structural Models (MSM)~\cite{Robins00} are the most popular models for causal inference from time-series observational data. However, they have two main drawbacks: (a) they do not capture subject heterogeneity, and (b) they only consider fixed time intervals and do not scale gracefully with longer intervals. In this work, we propose a new family of MSMs to address these two concerns. We model the potential outcomes as a three-dimensional tensor of low rank, where the three dimensions correspond to the agents, time periods and the set of possible histories. Unlike the traditional MSM, we allow the dimensions of the tensor to increase with the number of agents and time periods. We set up a weighted tensor completion problem as our estimation procedure, and show that the solution to this problem converges to the true model in an appropriate sense. Then we show how to solve the estimation problem, providing conditions under which we can approximately and efficiently solve the estimation problem. Finally we propose an algorithm based on projected gradient descent, which is easy to implement, and evaluate its performance on a simulated dataset.

**Minimax rates in outlier-robust estimation of discrete models**

We consider the problem of estimating the probability distribution of a discrete random variable in the setting where the observations are corrupted by outliers. Assuming that the discrete variable takes k values, the unknown parameter p is a k-dimensional vector belonging to the probability simplex. We first describe various settings of contamination and discuss the relation between these settings. We then establish minimax rates when the quality of estimation is measured by the total-variation distance, the Hellinger distance, or the L2-distance between two probability measures. Our analysis reveals that the minimax rates associated to these three distances are all different, but they are all attained by the maximum likelihood estimator. Note that the latter is efficiently computable even when the dimension is large. Some numerical experiments illustrating our theoretical findings are reported.

**Learning Generative Models of Structured Signals from Their Superposition Using GANs with Application to Denoising and Demixing**

Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a popular alternative for modeling complex high dimensional distributions. Most of the existing works implicitly assume that the clean samples from the target distribution are easily available. However, in many applications, this assumption is violated. In this paper, we consider the observation setting when the samples from target distribution are given by the superposition of two structured components and leverage GANs for learning the structure of the components. We propose two novel frameworks: denoising-GAN and demixing-GAN. The denoising-GAN assumes access to clean samples from the second component and try to learn the other distribution, whereas demixing-GAN learns the distribution of the components at the same time. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that proposed frameworks can generate clean samples from unknown distributions, and provide competitive performance in tasks such as denoising, demixing, and compressive sensing.

**Towards moderate overparameterization: global convergence guarantees for training shallow neural networks**

Many modern neural network architectures are trained in an overparameterized regime where the parameters of the model exceed the size of the training dataset. Sufficiently overparameterized neural network architectures in principle have the capacity to fit any set of labels including random noise. However, given the highly nonconvex nature of the training landscape it is not clear what level and kind of overparameterization is required for first order methods to converge to a global optima that perfectly interpolate any labels. A number of recent theoretical works have shown that for very wide neural networks where the number of hidden units is polynomially large in the size of the training data gradient descent starting from a random initialization does indeed converge to a global optima. However, in practice much more moderate levels of overparameterization seems to be sufficient and in many cases overparameterized models seem to perfectly interpolate the training data as soon as the number of parameters exceed the size of the training data by a constant factor. Thus there is a huge gap between the existing theoretical literature and practical experiments. In this paper we take a step towards closing this gap. Focusing on shallow neural nets and smooth activations, we show that (stochastic) gradient descent when initialized at random converges at a geometric rate to a nearby global optima as soon as the square-root of the number of network parameters exceeds the size of the training data. Our results also benefit from a fast convergence rate and continue to hold for non-differentiable activations such as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs).

**High dimensionality: The latest challenge to data analysis**

The advent of modern technology, permitting the measurement of thousands of characteristics simultaneously, has given rise to floods of data characterized by many large or even huge datasets. This new paradigm presents extraordinary challenges to data analysis and the question arises: how can conventional data analysis methods, devised for moderate or small datasets, cope with the complexities of modern data? The case of high dimensional data is particularly revealing of some of the drawbacks. We look at the case where the number of characteristics measured in an object is at least the number of observed objects and conclude that this configuration leads to geometrical and mathematical oddities and is an insurmountable barrier for the direct application of traditional methodologies. If scientists are going to ignore fundamental mathematical results arrived at in this paper and blindly use software to analyze data, the results of their analyses may not be trustful, and the findings of their experiments may never be validated. That is why new methods together with the wise use of traditional approaches are essential to progress safely through the present reality.

**Identity Crisis: Memorization and Generalization under Extreme Overparameterization**

We study the interplay between memorization and generalization of overparametrized networks in the extreme case of a single training example. The learning task is to predict an output which is as similar as possible to the input. We examine both fully-connected and convolutional networks that are initialized randomly and then trained to minimize the reconstruction error. The trained networks take one of the two forms: the constant function (‘memorization’) and the identity function (‘generalization’). We show that different architectures exhibit vastly different inductive bias towards memorization and generalization. An important consequence of our study is that even in extreme cases of overparameterization, deep learning can result in proper generalization.

**Differential Description Length for Hyperparameter Selection in Machine Learning**

This paper introduces a new method for model selection and more generally hyperparameter selection in machine learning. The paper first proves a relationship between generalization error and a difference of description lengths of the training data; we call this difference differential description length (DDL). This allows prediction of generalization error from the training data \emph{alone} by performing encoding of the training data. This can now be used for model selection by choosing the model that has the smallest predicted generalization error. We show how this encoding can be done for linear regression and neural networks. We provide experiments showing that this leads to smaller generalization error than cross-validation and traditional MDL and Bayes methods.

**Neural network models and deep learning – a primer for biologists**

Originally inspired by neurobiology, deep neural network models have become a powerful tool of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they are used to approximate functions and dynamics by learning from examples. Here we give a brief introduction to neural network models and deep learning for biologists. We introduce feedforward and recurrent networks and explain the expressive power of this modeling framework and the backpropagation algorithm for setting the parameters. Finally, we consider how deep neural networks might help us understand the brain’s computations.

**Statistical Failure Mechanism Analysis of Earthquakes Revealing Time Relationships**

If we assume that earthquakes are chaotic, and influenced locally then chaos theory suggests that there should be a temporal association between earthquakes in a local region that should be revealed with statistical examination. To date no strong relationship has been shown (refs not prediction). However, earthquakes are basically failures of structured material systems, and when multiple failure mechanisms are present, prediction of failure is strongly inhibited without first separating the mechanisms. Here we show that by separating earthquakes statistically, based on their central tensor moment structure, along lines first suggested by a separation into mechanisms according to depth of the earthquake, a strong indication of temporal association appears. We show this in earthquakes above 200 Km along the pacific ring of fire, with a positive association in time between earthquakes of the same statistical type and a negative association in time between earthquakes of different types. Whether this can reveal either useful mechanistic information to seismologists, or can result in useful forecasts remains to be seen.

**On the Expressive Power of Kernel Methods and the Efficiency of Kernel Learning by Association Schemes**

We study the expressive power of kernel methods and the algorithmic feasibility of multiple kernel learning for a special rich class of kernels. Specifically, we define \emph{Euclidean kernels}, a diverse class that includes most, if not all, families of kernels studied in literature such as polynomial kernels and radial basis functions. We then describe the geometric and spectral structure of this family of kernels over the hypercube (and to some extent for any compact domain). Our structural results allow us to prove meaningful limitations on the expressive power of the class as well as derive several efficient algorithms for learning kernels over different domains.

**SECTOR: A Neural Model for Coherent Topic Segmentation and Classification**

When searching for information, a human reader first glances over a document, spots relevant sections and then focuses on a few sentences for resolving her intention. However, the high variance of document structure complicates to identify the salient topic of a given section at a glance. To tackle this challenge, we present SECTOR, a model to support machine reading systems by segmenting documents into coherent sections and assigning topic labels to each section. Our deep neural network architecture learns a latent topic embedding over the course of a document. This can be leveraged to classify local topics from plain text and segment a document at topic shifts. In addition, we contribute WikiSection, a publicly available dataset with 242k labeled sections in English and German from two distinct domains: diseases and cities. From our extensive evaluation of 20 architectures, we report a highest score of 71.6% F1 for the segmentation and classification of 30 topics from the English city domain, scored by our SECTOR LSTM model with bloom filter embeddings and bidirectional segmentation. This is a significant improvement of 29.5 points F1 compared to state-of-the-art CNN classifiers with baseline segmentation.

**The Odds are Odd: A Statistical Test for Detecting Adversarial Examples**

We investigate conditions under which test statistics exist that can reliably detect examples, which have been adversarially manipulated in a white-box attack. These statistics can be easily computed and calibrated by randomly corrupting inputs. They exploit certain anomalies that adversarial attacks introduce, in particular if they follow the paradigm of choosing perturbations optimally under p-norm constraints. Access to the log-odds is the only requirement to defend models. We justify our approach empirically, but also provide conditions under which detectability via the suggested test statistics is guaranteed to be effective. In our experiments, we show that it is even possible to correct test time predictions for adversarial attacks with high accuracy.

**Relative rationality: Is machine rationality subjective?**

Rational decision making in its linguistic description means making logical decisions. In essence, a rational agent optimally processes all relevant information to achieve its goal. Rationality has two elements and these are the use of relevant information and the efficient processing of such information. In reality, relevant information is incomplete, imperfect and the processing engine, which is a brain for humans, is suboptimal. Humans are risk averse rather than utility maximizers. In the real world, problems are predominantly non-convex and this makes the idea of rational decision-making fundamentally unachievable and Herbert Simon called this bounded rationality. There is a trade-off between the amount of information used for decision-making and the complexity of the decision model used. This explores whether machine rationality is subjective and concludes that indeed it is.

**Dynamic Non-Diagonal Regularization in Interior Point Methods for Linear and Convex Quadratic Programming**

In this paper, we present a dynamic non-diagonal regularization for interior point methods. The non-diagonal aspect of this regularization is implicit, since all the off-diagonal elements of the regularization matrices are cancelled out by those elements present in the Newton system, which do not contribute important information in the computation of the Newton direction. Such a regularization has multiple goals. The obvious one is to improve the spectral properties of the Newton system solved at each iteration of the interior point method. On the other hand, the regularization matrices introduce sparsity to the aforementioned linear system, allowing for more efficient factorizations. We also propose a rule for tuning the regularization dynamically based on the properties of the problem, such that sufficiently large eigenvalues of the non-regularized system are perturbed insignificantly. This alleviates the need of finding specific regularization values through experimentation, which is the most common approach in literature. We provide perturbation bounds for the eigenvalues of the non-regularized system matrix and then discuss the spectral properties of the regularized matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method applied to solve standard small and medium-scale linear and convex quadratic programming test problems.

**Classifying Signals on Irregular Domains via Convolutional Cluster Pooling**

We present a novel and hierarchical approach for supervised classification of signals spanning over a fixed graph, reflecting shared properties of the dataset. To this end, we introduce a Convolutional Cluster Pooling layer exploiting a multi-scale clustering in order to highlight, at different resolutions, locally connected regions on the input graph. Our proposal generalises well-established neural models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on irregular and complex domains, by means of the exploitation of the weight sharing property in a graph-oriented architecture. In this work, such property is based on the centrality of each vertex within its soft-assigned cluster. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, CIFAR-10 and 20NEWS demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in capturing both local and global patterns in graph-structured data out of different domains.

**A Survey on Session-based Recommender Systems**

Session-based recommender systems (SBRS) are an emerging topic in the recommendation domain and have attracted much attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Most of existing works only work on modelling the general item-level dependency for recommendation tasks. However, there are many more other challenges at different levels, e.g., item feature level and session level, and from various perspectives, e.g., item heterogeneity and intra- and inter-item feature coupling relations, associated with SBRS. In this paper, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review on SBRS and create a hierarchical and in-depth understanding of a variety of challenges in SBRS. To be specific, we first illustrate the value and significance of SBRS, followed by a hierarchical framework to categorize the related research issues and methods of SBRS and to reveal its intrinsic challenges and complexities. Further, a summary together with a detailed introduction of the research progress is provided. Lastly, we share some prospects in this research area.

**Federated Machine Learning: Concept and Applications**

Today’s AI still faces two major challenges. One is that in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands. The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures and applications for the federated learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allow knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.

**Learning to Select Knowledge for Response Generation in Dialog Systems**

Generating informative responses in end-to-end neural dialogue systems attracts a lot of attention in recent years. Various previous work leverages external knowledge and the dialogue contexts to generate such responses. Nevertheless, few has demonstrated their capability on incorporating the appropriate knowledge in response generation. Motivated by this, we propose a novel open-domain conversation generation model in this paper, which employs the posterior knowledge distribution to guide knowledge selection, therefore generating more appropriate and informative responses in conversations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one who utilize the posterior knowledge distribution to facilitate conversation generation. Our experiments on both automatic and human evaluation clearly verify the superior performance of our model over the state-of-the-art baselines.

**Variance-Preserving Initialization Schemes Improve Deep Network Training: But Which Variance is Preserved?**

Before training a neural net, a classic rule of thumb is to randomly initialize the weights so that the variance of the preactivation is preserved across all layers. This is traditionally interpreted using the total variance due to randomness in both networks (weights) and samples. Alternatively, one can interpret the rule of thumb as preservation of the \emph{sample} mean and variance for a fixed network, i.e., preactivation statistics computed over the random sample of training samples. The two interpretations differ little for a shallow net, but the difference is shown to be large for a deep ReLU net by decomposing the total variance into the network-averaged sum of the sample variance and square of the sample mean. We demonstrate that the latter term dominates in the later layers through an analytical calculation in the limit of infinite network width, and numerical simulations for finite width. Our experimental results from training neural nets support the idea that preserving sample statistics can be better than preserving total variance. We discuss the implications for the alternative rule of thumb that a network should be initialized to be at the ‘edge of chaos.’

**Can We Automate Diagrammatic Reasoning?**

Learning to solve diagrammatic reasoning (DR) can be a challenging but interesting problem to the computer vision research community. It is believed that next generation pattern recognition applications should be able to simulate human brain to understand and analyze reasoning of images. However, due to the lack of benchmarks of diagrammatic reasoning, the present research primarily focuses on visual reasoning that can be applied to real-world objects. In this paper, we present a diagrammatic reasoning dataset that provides a large variety of DR problems. In addition, we also propose a Knowledge-based Long Short Term Memory (KLSTM) to solve diagrammatic reasoning problems. Our proposed analysis is arguably the first work in this research area. Several state-of-the-art learning frameworks have been used to compare with the proposed KLSTM framework in the present context. Preliminary results indicate that the domain is highly related to computer vision and pattern recognition research with several challenging avenues.

**Estimation of causal CARMA random fields**

We estimate model parameters of L\’evy-driven causal CARMA random fields by fitting the empirical variogram to the theoretical counterpart using a weighted least squares (WLS) approach. Subsequent to deriving asymptotic results for the variogram estimator, we show strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the parameter estimator. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation study to assess the quality of the WLS estimator for finite samples. For the simulation we utilize numerical approximation schemes based on truncation and discretization of stochastic integrals and we analyze the associated simulation errors in detail. Finally, we apply our results to real data of the cosmic microwave background.

**Two-Dimensional Batch Linear Programming on the GPU**

This paper presents a novel, high-performance, graphical processing unit-based algorithm for efficiently solving two-dimensional linear programs in batches. The domain of two-dimensional linear programs is particularly useful due to the prevalence of relevant geometric problems. Batch linear programming refers to solving numerous different linear programs within one operation. By solving many linear programs simultaneously and distributing workload evenly across threads, graphical processing unit utilization can be maximized. Speedups of over 22 times and 63 times are obtained against state-of-the-art graphics processing unit and CPU linear program solvers, respectively.

**Wasserstein Barycenter Model Ensembling**

In this paper we propose to perform model ensembling in a multiclass or a multilabel learning setting using Wasserstein (W.) barycenters. Optimal transport metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance, allow incorporating semantic side information such as word embeddings. Using W. barycenters to find the consensus between models allows us to balance confidence and semantics in finding the agreement between the models. We show applications of Wasserstein ensembling in attribute-based classification, multilabel learning and image captioning generation. These results show that the W. ensembling is a viable alternative to the basic geometric or arithmetic mean ensembling.

**ATMSeer: Increasing Transparency and Controllability in Automated Machine Learning**

To relieve the pain of manually selecting machine learning algorithms and tuning hyperparameters, automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been developed to automatically search for good models. Due to the huge model search space, it is impossible to try all models. Users tend to distrust automatic results and increase the search budget as much as they can, thereby undermining the efficiency of AutoML. To address these issues, we design and implement ATMSeer, an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer, we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts. A multi-granularity visualization is proposed to enable users to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the searched models, and refine the search space in real time. We demonstrate the utility and usability of ATMSeer through two case studies, expert interviews, and a user study with 13 end users.
