I must preface this post with the posit that if youâ€™re doing anything `interactive()` with Amazon Athena you should seriously consider just using their free ODBC drivers as itâ€™s the easiest way to wire them up to R DBI- and tidyverse-wise. Iâ€™ve said as much in previous posts. Drop a note in the comments if you donâ€™t know the incantations for repackaging the provided Linux ODBC drivers to work on your flavor of Linux.

*However*â€¦

There are timesâ€”say, when youâ€™re trying to stand up an R service in your kubernetes cluster which bridges data in Athena to analyses & visualizations in Râ€”when ODBC drivers can be more of a hindrance than help and JDBC is the path of least resistance.

Sure, thereâ€™s the in-CRAN `AWR.Athena` package but itâ€™s a fairly constrained and low-feature RJDBC shim which gets the basic job done but not much more.

Enter:

a trio of packages which aims to make it super-straightforward to wire up R to Amazon Athena when ODBC is not available.

### Why Three Packages?

For starters, there are CRAN hopes for the `metis`-trio and one key component of that is separating out the JARs into one package (`metis.jars`) and actual functionality into others (`metis` and `metis.tidy`). Weâ€™ll see how the CRAN attempt goes since the JAR package weighs in at sufficient weight to warrant a `NOTE`. The packaging of the driver reduces the need for you to pre-load the JAR (locally or into, say, a Docker image) or perform a package-initiated download-dance like `AWR.Athena` does (which I still donâ€™t understand why that hasnâ€™t kicked it out of CRAN the way it does it but Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯).

`metis.jars` also has three helper functions which do some (basic) fun things:

```
library(metis.jars)

simba_driver_version()
## [1] "02.00.06.1008"

athena_supported_types()
## [1] "BOOLEAN" "TINYINT" "SMALLINT" "INT" "INTEGER" 
## [6] "BIGINT" "REAL" "FLOAT" "DOUBLE" "DECIMAL" 
## [11] "DATE" "TIMESTAMP" "BINARY" "VARBINARY" "CHAR" 
## [16] "VARCHAR" "STRING" "ARRAY" "MAP" "ROW" 
## [21] "STRUCT" 

metis_jar_path()
## [1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/metis.jars/java/AthenaJDBC42_2.0.6.jar"

```

The first uses the `rJava` interface to directly query the version (since Amazon seems to update the Simba JAR twice a year). By separating out the JAR into a separate package, updates can be made to the other two sibling packages more frequently without crushing CRANâ€™s disk space. `metis.jars` is also versioned to the included JAR so configuration management will be easier for folks.

The reason for the second type-lister function is that thereâ€™s hope Amazon will add support for *all* Presto data types, especially `IPADDRESS`. It, again, performs JDBC driver introspection to collect the supported types.

Finally, the third function abstracts the JAR location from the `metis` package or even *your own* interface package should you choose to depend on it.

### OK, But Why Not Just Two?

The `metis` package is a more functional RJDBC superclass of a DBI wrapper than `AWR.Athena`. One thing it does that its CRAN cousin cannot is handle `BIGINT`s properly:

```
library(metis)

dbConnect(
 metis::Athena(),
 Schema = "sampledb",
 AwsCredentialsProviderClass = "com.simba.athena.amazonaws.auth.PropertiesFileCredentialsProvider",
 AwsCredentialsProviderArguments = path.expand("~/.aws/athenaCredentials.props")
) -> con

dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT
 CAST('chr' AS CHAR(4)) achar,
 CAST('varchr' AS VARCHAR) avarchr,
 CAST(SUBSTR(timestamp, 1, 10) AS DATE) AS tsday,
 CAST(100.1 AS DOUBLE) AS justadbl,
 CAST(127 AS TINYINT) AS asmallint,
 CAST(100 AS INTEGER) AS justanint,
 CAST(100000000000000000 AS BIGINT) AS abigint,
 CAST(('GET' = 'GET') AS BOOLEAN) AS is_get,
 ARRAY[1, 2, 3] AS arr1,
 ARRAY['1', '2, 3', '4'] AS arr2,
 MAP(ARRAY['foo', 'bar'], ARRAY[1, 2]) AS mp,
 CAST(ROW(1, 2.0) AS ROW(x BIGINT, y DOUBLE)) AS rw,
 CAST('{\"a\":1}' AS JSON) js
FROM elb_logs
LIMIT 1
") %>% 
 dplyr::glimpse()
## Observations: 1
## Variables: 13
## $ achar "chr "
## $ avarchr "varchr"
## $ tsday 2014-09-29
## $ justadbl 100.1
## $ asmallint 127
## $ justanint 100
## $ abigint 100000000000000000
## $ is_get TRUE
## $ arr1 "1, 2, 3"
## $ arr2 "1, 2, 3, 4"
## $ mp "{bar=2, foo=1}"
## $ rw "{x=1, y=2.0}"
## $ js "\"{\\\"a\\\":1}\""

```

PrestoAthena arrays and maps and rows and JSON come across as characters from the Athena driver and theyâ€™re formatted so badly that thereâ€™s little hope of full R support for `list` columns for them. *But*, you do get real, big integers with `metis` along with full support for all other current Athena types.

R folk who may be users of the old, standalone `metis` package need to be aware of some things.

First, `dbConnect()` has breaking changes. The snake_case names that still exist in the higher-level `athena_jdbc()` function are gone. In exchange for this pain, you now have full naming-parity with all the Athena JDBC connection properties and can more easily use alternate credential providers which `metis`â€˜ cousin totally cannot do for you which is illustrated in the example above and in the package README.

The `metis` package also makes it easier to see documentation for *all* available Athena connection properties since it has a vignette with a descriptive table of all of them (rendered here).

There is also nascent support for the â€œstreaming APIâ€� (TLDR: faster result set downloads) but that wonâ€™t be fully tested until some AWS policy tweaks happen this week.

### Gotcha. But, Why Not Just Two?

As awesome as it is (including base Docker image support) the `tidyverse` is not without overhead in terms of compilation time and dependencies, both of which are especially painful on Linux systems and some Docker environments. You can absolutely get by with some well-crafted SQL and JDBC and the thinner the image the easier it is to deploy and scale.

But! The tidyverse is *so helpful* that ensuring smooth support for Athena is critical. On its own, `metis` wires up to `dplyr`/`dbplyr` fine, but by providing (in `metis.tidy`) some enhanced `db_data_type()` support (primarily for `BIGINT`) and some extra ![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f499.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f499.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 in `sql_translate_env()` )for those of us who continue to mindlessly use R-only verbs like `grep()` or `as.POSIXct()` in non-R contexts) we can level-up `interactive()` use and tidyverse-infused service use:

```
library(metis.tidy)
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)

metis::dbConnect(
 metis::Athena(),
 Schema = "sampledb",
 AwsCredentialsProviderClass = "com.simba.athena.amazonaws.auth.PropertiesFileCredentialsProvider",
 AwsCredentialsProviderArguments = path.expand("~/.aws/athenaCredentials.props")
) -> con

elb_logs <- tbl(con, "elb_logs")

filter(elb_logs, grepl("20", elbresponsecode)) %>%
 mutate(
 tsday = as.Date(substring(timestamp, 1L, 10L)),
 host = url_extract_host(url),
 proto_version = regexp_extract(protocol, "([[:digit:]\\.]+)"),
 ) %>%
 select(tsday, host, receivedbytes, requestprocessingtime, proto_version) %>%
 head(1) %>%
 glimpse()
## Observations: ??
## Variables: 5
## Database: AthenaConnection
## $ tsday 2014-09-29
## $ host "www.abcxyz.com"
## $ receivedbytes 0
## $ requestprocessingtime 9.5e-05
## $ proto_version "1.1"

```

### FIN

A fairly big impetus for this radical refactoring was the need to use the Athena JDBC interface in R at $DAYJOB in a serverless context. So, if I/we needed it, others may as well. All three packages have tests (that work with my personal Athena setup which is easily replicated since itâ€™s just the default schema & table you get when you enable Athena), pass CRAN checks and will be live in a real production environment by the time you read this.

Note that I do have CRAN plans for these three amigos, but all three packages will need to go in at the same time and I need to get tests into- and prove tests are live in Travis before submitting. Nowâ€™s the time for feature requests, problem reports or issues. Until SourceHutâ€™s (sr.ht) API is finished, said contributions are best left to GitLab (preferably) or GitHub (if you must continue to fill the coffers of giant multional companies that undermine your freedom).

### POSTSCRIPT

One other reason for re-visiting `metis` was this R-crashing `rJava` issue that is really a Simba Athena implementation issue (OS signals in a JDBC driver, *rly*?)

This `Rprofile` entry:

```
options(
 "java.parameters" = c(getOption("java.parameters", default = NULL), "-Xrs")
)

```

has been a solid workaround until `rJava` is updated. Note that `metis.jars` warns about this on load if it detects your setup is at risk.
