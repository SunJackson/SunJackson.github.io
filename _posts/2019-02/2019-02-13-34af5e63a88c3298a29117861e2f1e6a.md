**Scalable Generalized Dynamic Topic Model** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Dynamic topic models (DTMs) model the evolution of prevalent themes in literature, online media, and other forms of text over time. DTMs assume that word co-occurrence statistics change continuously and therefore impose continuous stochastic process priors on their model parameters. These dynamical priors make inference much harder than in regular topic models, and also limit scalability. In this paper, we present several new results around DTMs. First, we extend the class of tractable priors from Wiener processes to the generic class of Gaussian processes (GPs). This allows us to explore topics that develop smoothly over time, that have a long-term memory or are temporally concentrated (for event detection). Second, we show how to perform scalable approximate inference in these models based on ideas around stochastic variational inference and sparse Gaussian processes. This way we can train a rich family of DTMs to massive data. Our experiments on several large-scale datasets show that our generalized model allows us to find interesting patterns that were not accessible by previous approaches. … 

**Canonicalization Using Embeddings and Side Information (CESI)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) methods extract (noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase) triples from text, resulting in the construction of large Open Knowledge Bases (Open KBs). The noun phrases (NPs) and relation phrases in such Open KBs are not canonicalized, leading to the storage of redundant and ambiguous facts. Recent research has posed canonicalization of Open KBs as clustering over manuallydefined feature spaces. Manual feature engineering is expensive and often sub-optimal. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose Canonicalization using Embeddings and Side Information (CESI) – a novel approach which performs canonicalization over learned embeddings of Open KBs. CESI extends recent advances in KB embedding by incorporating relevant NP and relation phrase side information in a principled manner. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate CESI’s effectiveness. … 

**Rectified Wire Network** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We introduce a new neural network model, together with a tractable and monotone online learning algorithm. Our model describes feed-forward networks for classification, with one output node for each class. The only nonlinear operation is rectification using a ReLU function with a bias. However, there is a rectifier on every edge rather than at the nodes of the network. There are also weights, but these are positive, static, and associated with the nodes. Our rectified wire networks are able to represent arbitrary Boolean functions. Only the bias parameters, on the edges of the network, are learned. Another departure in our approach, from standard neural networks, is that the loss function is replaced by a constraint. This constraint is simply that the value of the output node associated with the correct class should be zero. Our model has the property that the exact norm-minimizing parameter update, required to correctly classify a training item, is the solution to a quadratic program that can be computed with a few passes through the network. We demonstrate a training algorithm using this update, called sequential deactivation (SDA), on MNIST and some synthetic datasets. Upon adopting a natural choice for the nodal weights, SDA has no hyperparameters other than those describing the network structure. Our experiments explore behavior with respect to network size and depth in a family of sparse expander networks. …
