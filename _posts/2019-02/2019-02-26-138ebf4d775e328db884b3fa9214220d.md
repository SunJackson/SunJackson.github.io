Not unlike the Rblpapi release on Thursday and the RVowpalWabbit release on Friday (both of which dealt with the upcoming *staged install*), we now have another CRAN-requested maintenance release. This time it is RcppStreams which got onto CRAN as of early this morning. RcppStreams brings the excellent Streamulus C++ template library for event stream processing to R.

Streamulus, written by Irit Katriel, uses very clever template meta-programming (via Boost Fusion) to implement an embedded *domain-specific event language* created specifically for event stream processing.

This release provides suppresses issue reported by the UBSAN detector set up at Oxford; I simply no longer run the examples that triggered it as the errors came from *very deep down* inside Boost Proto and Fusion. As a more positive side effect, I updated the Rocker R-Devel SAN/UBSAN Clang image and corresponding Docker container. So if you need SAN/UBSAN detection, that container may become your friend.

The NEWS file entries follows below:

> 
Changes in version 0.1.3 (2019-02-24)

- No longer run examples as they upset the UBSAN checks at CRAN



Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a copy of the `DESCRIPTION` file for this initial release. More detailed information is on the RcppStreams page page and of course on the Streamulus page.
