**[Webinar] Managing the Complete Machine Learning Lifecycle**



**Thursday, March 7, 2019 @ 10am PST**






Machine learning brings new complexities beyond the traditional software development lifecycle. To address these challenges, Databricks unveiled MLflow, an open source project aimed at simplifying the entire machine learning lifecycle. 
 







- Keep track of experiment runs and results across frameworks.

- Execute projects remotely on to a Databricks cluster, and quickly reproduce your runs.

- Quickly productionize models using Databricks production jobs, Docker containers, Azure ML, or Amazon SageMaker.






Notebooks will be provided after this webinar so that you can practice at your own pace.
