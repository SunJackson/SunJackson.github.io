This post will display some robustness results for KDA asset allocation. 

Ultimately, the two canary instruments fare much better using the original filter weights in Defensive Asset Allocation than in other variants of the weights for the filter. While this isn’t as worrying (the filter most likely was created that way and paired with those instruments by design), what *is* somewhat more irritating is that the strategy is dependent upon the end-of-month phenomenon, meaning this strategy cannot be simply tranched throughout an entire trading month. 

So first off, let’s review the code from last time:

```
# KDA asset allocation 
# KDA stands for Kipnis Defensive Adaptive (Asset Allocation).

# compute strategy statistics
stratStats <- function(rets) {
 stats <- rbind(table.AnnualizedReturns(rets), maxDrawdown(rets))
 stats[5,] <- stats[1,]/stats[4,]
 stats[6,] <- stats[1,]/UlcerIndex(rets)
 rownames(stats)[4] <- "Worst Drawdown"
 rownames(stats)[5] <- "Calmar Ratio"
 rownames(stats)[6] <- "Ulcer Performance Index"
 return(stats)
}

# required libraries
require(quantmod)
require(PerformanceAnalytics)
require(tseries)

# symbols
symbols <- c("SPY", "VGK", "EWJ", "EEM", "VNQ", "RWX", "IEF", "TLT", "DBC", "GLD", "VWO", "BND") 


# get data
rets <- list()
for(i in 1:length(symbols)) {
 
 returns <- Return.calculate(Ad(get(getSymbols(symbols[i], from = '1990-01-01'))))
 colnames(returns) <- symbols[i]
 rets[[i]] <- returns
}
rets <- na.omit(do.call(cbind, rets))


# algorithm
KDA <- function(rets, offset = 0, leverageFactor = 1.5, momWeights = c(12, 4, 2, 1)) {
 
 # get monthly endpoints, allow for offsetting ala AllocateSmartly/Newfound Research
 ep <- endpoints(rets) + offset
 ep[ep < 1] <- 1
 ep[ep > nrow(rets)] <- nrow(rets)
 ep <- unique(ep)
 epDiff <- diff(ep)
 if(last(epDiff)==1) { # if the last period only has one observation, remove it
 ep <- ep[-length(ep)]
 }
 
 # initialize vector holding zeroes for assets
 emptyVec <- data.frame(t(rep(0, 10)))
 colnames(emptyVec) <- symbols[1:10]
 
 
 allWts <- list()
 # we will use the 13612F filter
 for(i in 1:(length(ep)-12)) {
 
 # 12 assets for returns -- 2 of which are our crash protection assets
 retSubset <- rets[c((ep[i]+1):ep[(i+12)]),]
 epSub <- ep[i:(i+12)]
 sixMonths <- rets[(epSub[7]+1):epSub[13],]
 threeMonths <- rets[(epSub[10]+1):epSub[13],]
 oneMonth <- rets[(epSub[12]+1):epSub[13],]
 
 # computer 13612 fast momentum
 moms <- Return.cumulative(oneMonth) * momWeights[1] + Return.cumulative(threeMonths) * momWeights[2] + 
 Return.cumulative(sixMonths) * momWeights[3] + Return.cumulative(retSubset) * momWeights[4]
 assetMoms <- moms[,1:10] # Adaptive Asset Allocation investable universe
 cpMoms <- moms[,11:12] # VWO and BND from Defensive Asset Allocation
 
 # find qualifying assets
 highRankAssets <- rank(assetMoms) >= 6 # top 5 assets
 posReturnAssets <- assetMoms > 0 # positive momentum assets
 selectedAssets <- highRankAssets & posReturnAssets # intersection of the above
 
 # perform mean-variance/quadratic optimization
 if(sum(selectedAssets)==0) {
 investedAssets <- emptyVec
 } else if(sum(selectedAssets)==1) {
 investedAssets <- emptyVec + selectedAssets 
 } else {
 idx <- which(selectedAssets)
 # use 1-3-6-12 fast correlation average to match with momentum filter 
 cors <- (cor(oneMonth[,idx]) * momWeights[1] + cor(threeMonths[,idx]) * momWeights[2] + 
 cor(sixMonths[,idx]) * momWeights[3] + cor(retSubset[,idx]) * momWeights[4])/sum(momWeights)
 vols <- StdDev(oneMonth[,idx]) # use last month of data for volatility computation from AAA
 covs <- t(vols) %*% vols * cors
 
 # do standard min vol optimization
 minVolRets <- t(matrix(rep(1, sum(selectedAssets))))
 minVolWt <- portfolio.optim(x=minVolRets, covmat = covs)$pw
 names(minVolWt) <- colnames(covs)
 investedAssets <- emptyVec
 investedAssets[,selectedAssets] <- minVolWt
 }
 
 # crash protection -- between aggressive allocation and crash protection allocation
 pctAggressive <- mean(cpMoms > 0)
 investedAssets <- investedAssets * pctAggressive 
 pctCp <- 1-pctAggressive
 
 # if IEF momentum is positive, invest all crash protection allocation into it
 # otherwise stay in cash for crash allocation
 if(assetMoms["IEF"] > 0) {
 investedAssets["IEF"] <- investedAssets["IEF"] + pctCp
 }
 
 # leverage portfolio if desired in cases when both risk indicator assets have positive momentum
 if(pctAggressive == 1) {
 investedAssets = investedAssets * leverageFactor
 }
 
 # append to list of monthly allocations
 wts <- xts(investedAssets, order.by=last(index(retSubset)))
 allWts[[i]] <- wts
 }
 
 # put all weights together and compute cash allocation
 allWts <- do.call(rbind, allWts)
 allWts$CASH <- 1-rowSums(allWts)
 
 # add cash returns to universe of investments
 investedRets <- rets[,1:10]
 investedRets$CASH <- 0
 
 # compute portfolio returns
 out <- Return.portfolio(R = investedRets, weights = allWts)
 return(list(allWts, out))
}


```


So, the idea is that we take the basic Adaptive Asset Allocation algorithm, and wrap it in a canary universe from Defensive Asset Allocation (see previous post for links to both), which we use to control capital allocation, ranging from 0 to 1 (or beyond, in cases where leverage applies). 

One of the ideas was to test out different permutations of the parameters belonging to the canary filter–a 1, 3, 6, 12 weighted filter focusing on the first month.

There are two interesting variants of this–equal weighting on the filter (both for momentum and the safety assets), and reversing the weights (that is, 1 * 1, 3 * 2, 6 * 4, 12 * 12). Here are the results of that experiment:


# different leverages
KDA_100 <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1)
KDA_EW <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1, momWeights = c(1,1,1,1))
KDA_rev <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1, momWeights = c(1, 2, 4, 12))
# KDA_150 <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1.5)
# KDA_200 <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 2)

# compare
compare <- na.omit(cbind(KDA_100[[2]], KDA_EW[[2]], KDA_rev[[2]]))
colnames(compare) <- c("KDA_base", "KDA_EW", "KDA_rev")
charts.PerformanceSummary(compare, colorset = c('black', 'purple', 'gold'), 
 main = "KDA AA with various momentum weights")

stratStats(compare)
apply.yearly(compare, Return.cumulative)



```
# different leverages
KDA_100 <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1)
KDA_EW <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1, momWeights = c(1,1,1,1))
KDA_rev <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1, momWeights = c(1, 2, 4, 12))
# KDA_150 <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1.5)
# KDA_200 <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 2)

# compare
compare <- na.omit(cbind(KDA_100[[2]], KDA_EW[[2]], KDA_rev[[2]]))
colnames(compare) <- c("KDA_base", "KDA_EW", "KDA_rev")
charts.PerformanceSummary(compare, colorset = c('black', 'purple', 'gold'), 
 main = "KDA AA with various momentum weights")

stratStats(compare)
apply.yearly(compare, Return.cumulative)


```

So, one mea culpa: after comparing AllocateSmartly, my initial code (which I’ve since edited, most likely owing to getting some logic mixed up when I added functionality to lag the day of month to trade) had some sort of bug in it which gave a slightly better than expected 2015 return. Nevertheless, the results are very similar. What is interesting to note is that in the raging bull market that was essentially from 2010 onwards, the equal weight and reverse weight filters don’t perform too badly, though the reverse weight filter has a massive drawdown in 2011, but in terms of capitalizing in awful markets, the original filter as designed by Keller and TrendXplorer works best, both in terms of making money during the recession, and does better near the market bottom in 2009.

Now that that’s out of the way, the more interesting question is how does the strategy work when not trading at the end of the month? Long story short, the best time to trade it is in the last week of the month. Once the new month rolls around, hands off. If you’re talking about tranching this strategy, then you have about a week’s time to get your positions in, so I’m not sure the actual dollar volume this strategy can manage, as it’s dependent on the month-end effect (I know that one of my former managers–a brilliant man, by all accounts–said that this phenomena no longer existed, but I feel these empirical results refute that assertion in this particular instance). Here are these results:

```
lagCompare <- list()
for(i in 1:21) {
 offRets <- KDA(rets, leverageFactor = 1, offset = i)
 tmp <- offRets[[2]]
 colnames(tmp) <- paste0("Lag", i)
 lagCompare[[i]] <- tmp
}
lagCompare <- do.call(cbind, lagCompare)
lagCompare <- na.omit(cbind(KDA_100[[2]], lagCompare))
colnames(lagCompare)[1] <- "Base"

charts.PerformanceSummary(lagCompare, colorset=c("orange", rep("gray", 21)))
stratStats(lagCompare)


```

Essentially, the trade at the very end of the month is the only one with a Calmar ratio above 1, though the Calmar ratio from lag15 to lag 21 is about .8 or higher, with a Sharpe ratio of 1 or higher. So, there’s definitely a window of when to trade, and when not to–namely, the lag 1 through 5 variations have the worst performances by no small margin. Therefore, I strongly suspect that the 1-3-6-12 filter was designed around the idea of the end-of-month effect, or at least, not stress-tested for different trading days within the month (and given that longer-dated data is only monthly, this is understandable).

Nevertheless, I hope this does answer some people’s questions from the quant finance universe. I know that Corey Hoffstein of Think Newfound (and wow that blog is good from the perspective of properties of trend-following) loves diversifying across every bit of the process, though in this case, I do think there’s something to be said about “diworsification”. 

In any case, I do think there are some future research venues for further research here. 

Thanks for reading.
