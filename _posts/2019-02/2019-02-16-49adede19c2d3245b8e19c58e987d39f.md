“It takes a lot of will power, in our data obsessed world to say ‘too much!’ However, there are many ways where too much information is destroying productivity, and actually causing bad decision making, not good. But it is hard to avoid the world of opportunities that has been opened in data collection and analysis. So how do you balance the two? The first step is to understand there is a big difference between data collection, and it’s utilization. While it seems subtle, the difference is key, and utilization is where many make mistakes.” Chris Riley
