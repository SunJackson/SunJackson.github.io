Io-Tahoe, a pioneer in smart data discovery and AI-driven data catalog products has released the latest version of its Smart Data Discovery platform with enhanced PII and Sensitive Data Discovery capabilities. Leveraging Io-Tahoe’s advanced technology and machine learning algorithms, Io-Tahoe is now positioned to help companies solve the complex challenge of regulatory compliance with an automated, AI-driven approach to discover, understand and catalog PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and other sensitive data covered by the forthcoming California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as well as other major privacy regulations worldwide.

The Io-Tahoe platform allows organizations to quickly detect sensitive data in structured, semi-structured and some unstructured formats. Io-Tahoe also provides enterprise subject matter experts with the ability to add and modify company or industry specific policies within minutes for even more thorough detection of PII and sensitive data. Leveraging its machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to automate the data discovery process, Io-Tahoe supports companies with developing new insights into their PII footprint within weeks, without any burden on SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), so the organization can focus on remediation activities.

Io-Tahoe’s latest version can track changes to the sensitive data landscape over time to understand how the PII and the sensitive data footprint is changing, enabling firms to continually keep track of their data on an ongoing basis. This capability further helps enterprises comply with CCPA and other laws, especially as they evolve, change and become even more stringent.
