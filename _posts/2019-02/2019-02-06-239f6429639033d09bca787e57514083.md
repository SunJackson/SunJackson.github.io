rstudio::conf 2019 featured 15 workshops on tidyverse, Shiny, R Markdown, modeling and machine learning, deep learning, big data, and what they forgot to teach you about working with R. Some of the new workshops for this year touched on topics like putting Shiny applications into production at scale and R & Tensorflow. The conference also featured certification workshops on RStudio Professional Administrator and Train-the-trainer for tidyverse and Shiny.

Below is a list of all workshops we hosted, with links to materials. Even thoughthe materials alone cannot replace the actual workshop experience, we hope that you’ll find them useful. RStudio regularly hosts workshops throughout the year so please subscribe to training updates. You can also find out more about each of the workshopsat the conference repository.
