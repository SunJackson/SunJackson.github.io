**AutoCorrelation Function (ACF)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The auto-correlation function measures the correlation of a signal x(t) with itself shifted by some time delay tau. The auto-correlation function can be used to detect repeats or periodicity in a signal. E.g. to use the auto-correlation to assess the effect of fluctuations (noise) on a periodic signal. … 

**Extended PCA (XPCA)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Principal component analysis (PCA) is arguably the most popular tool in multivariate exploratory data analysis. In this paper, we consider the question of how to handle heterogeneous variables that include continuous, binary, and ordinal. In the probabilistic interpretation of low-rank PCA, the data has a normal multivariate distribution and, therefore, normal marginal distributions for each column. If some marginals are continuous but not normal, the semiparametric copula-based principal component analysis (COCA) method is an alternative to PCA that combines a Gaussian copula with nonparametric marginals. If some marginals are discrete or semi-continuous, we propose a new extended PCA (XPCA) method that also uses a Gaussian copula and nonparametric marginals and accounts for discrete variables in the likelihood calculation by integrating over appropriate intervals. Like PCA, the factors produced by XPCA can be used to find latent structure in data, build predictive models, and perform dimensionality reduction. We present the new model, its induced likelihood function, and a fitting algorithm which can be applied in the presence of missing data. We demonstrate how to use XPCA to produce an estimated full conditional distribution for each data point, and use this to produce to provide estimates for missing data that are automatically range respecting. We compare the methods as applied to simulated and real-world data sets that have a mixture of discrete and continuous variables. … 

**Kanerva Machine** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present an end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them. Inspired by Kanerva’s sparse distributed memory, it has a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism. The memory is analytically tractable, which enables optimal on-line compression via a Bayesian update-rule. We formulate it as a hierarchical conditional generative model, where memory provides a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Consequently, the top-down memory and bottom-up perception are combined to produce the code representing an observation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the adaptive memory significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Compared with the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and its variants, our memory model has greater capacity and is significantly easier to train. …
