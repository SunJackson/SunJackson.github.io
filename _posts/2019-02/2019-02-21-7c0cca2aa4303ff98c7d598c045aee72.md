This tutorial is going to cover how to set up a temperature/humidity sensor witha raspberry pi. You will learn how to setup the sensor, a MYSQL server, andconnect to the databse remotely in R. I will also do exploratorydata analysis in R with the stored readings. A little bit of familiarity with linux, mysql servers,soldering skills, and R is helpful but not mandatory. The materials requiredare:

- Raspberry Pi with standard setup (SD card, case, etc.)

- Adafruit AM2302 (wired DHT22) temperature-humidity sensor

- Soldering Iron

- Female Pin Headers

- Small piece of wood

Final Product

*Final Product*

I mostly followed the tutorial found here.The majority of the work in this post is not using R. Instead of rebuildingeverything, I wanted to build off of content that has made and sensor readingsare handled a bit better by a low level language (C is used here).

We are going to start with the assumption that you have already set up theraspberry pi and soldered the sensor to the GPIO. An excellent repository alreadyexists at http://wiringpi.com/. It provides a C interfaceto the GPIO that will prevent us from having to write any of the low level code.I’m going to SSH into my headless pi and install the wiringPi program with thefollowing commands. In the examples, you can build and run a program to checkif you are getting good readings.

```
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
./build
cd examples
make rht03
./rht03
```

You should see readings from the sensor now. Type `CTRL+c` to quit theprogram.

In this step we are going to install MYSQL server and create some securityaround it. When you see ‘username’ or ‘password’ those are meant for you toreplace with your own credentials. Instead of only using root to accessthe server with elevated priviliges, I am going to grant all privileges toa different user, but only when on the ‘localhost’, Essentially, you need toremote in currently to access the server with your ‘user’ credentials. Last,log back into the server with your new user identity for the next step.

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo mysql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
\q
mysql -u 'username' -p
```

Now, let’s create a database and a table with the time in UNIX integer time andtwo other columns for the sensor readings that we want to record.

```
create database Monitoring;
use Monitoring;
create table Climate (ComputerTime INTEGER UNSIGNED,Temperature DECIMAL(5,1), Humidity DECIMAL(5,1));
```

You will need to download this file:

th.c

Change the `'root'` and `'password'`credentials to match the user that you set up earlier. You will need to copyover the Makefile and change some flags so that the program knows where tofind some of the drivers that it needs.

```
cp wiringPi/examples/Makefile ~/raspberrypi/monitor/Makefile
sudo nano ~/raspberrypi/monitor/Makefile
```

Add the following lines to the file:

```
INCLUDE = -I/usr/local/include,/usr/include/mysql
LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib,/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf -lmysqlclient -lpthread -lz -lm -lrt -ldl
```

Compile the program:

```
make ~/raspberrypi/monintor/th
```

You will now run the program that you altered and compiled. Use the `&` torun the program continuously in the background. The program will write thetemperature and humidity every 60 seconds to the database.

```
./raspberrypi/monitor/th &
```

This step is optional but good to have for troubleshooting. Later, I will beconnecting remotely on my laptop instead of working in R on the raspberry pi.

```
sudo apt-get install r-base
sudo su - -e 'install.packages("DBI", "RMariaDB")'
```

After a couple hours, you should have a good amount of data. I’m going to beconnecting from my laptop so I’ll need to set up my user credentials withprivileges to access over my LAN which to cover all ip addresses that getassigned use the `%` (wildcard) at the end of `192.168.1` (your LAN isalready set to use this ip address numbering system).

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* TO 'user'@'192.168.1.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
\q
```

Let’s make sure that the server has a port that we can access. If it’s notalready in the `my.conf` file, open up the file with a text editor.

```
sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

Add the following lines to the file which opens up the default port 3306 forthe mysql server and then bind to current IP address.

```
[msqld]
port=3306
bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

Restart the service for the changes to take effect.

```
sudo service mysql restart
```

You can log off the machine now. We don’t need to do anything else on theraspberry pi for now.

From RStudio on my laptop (while connected to my LAN), we’re going to opena connection to the database. You can specify the host as a DNS name thatcan be set up on your router’s administration portal or you can specify theIP address. I would recommend making the IP address static if you plan onusing that method going forward. Since we stored the timestamp in UNIXinteger form, we can convert it to POSIXct knowing that the origin of UNIXtime is the start of the year 1970.

```
library(DBI)
library(ggplot2)
library(trstyles) # optional package for my styling of ggplot2 plots

con <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), host = 'sensorpi', 
 user = 'pi', password = 'password',
 dbname = 'Monitoring')
query <- 'SELECT ComputerTime, Temperature, Humidity FROM Climate'
readings <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
readings[['ComputerTime']] <- as.POSIXct(readings[['ComputerTime']], 
 origin = '1970-01-01 00:00:00')
```

Now that we have the data, let’s plot temperature against time to see what hasbeen going on.

```
ggplot(readings) +
 geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Temperature)) +
 scale_y_continuous(name = expression('Temperature ('*degree*'C)'),
 sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*9/5+32, 
 name = 
 expression('Temperature ('*degree*'F)'))) +
 scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
 theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))
```

It looks good for the most part, but we definitely have some outlier readings.I can see probably outliers at 30 degrees Celsius. I’m going to cut those offand take a second look.

```
readings[['Temperature']][readings[['Temperature']] > 30] <- NA
ggplot(readings) +
 geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Temperature)) +
 scale_y_continuous(name = expression('Temperature ('*degree*'C)'),
 sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*9/5+32, 
 name = 
 expression('Temperature ('*degree*'F)'))) +
 scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
 theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))
```

You can see some patterns already existing within the data. Given how theweather patterns have been, adding in some outside temperature readings wouldprovide some more insight into what is going on. I’ll dive into some moreanalysis in another post.

We can do the same for the relative humidity.

```
ggplot(readings) +
 geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Humidity), color = '#9D5863') +
 scale_y_continuous(name = 'Relative Humidity (Rh)') +
 scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
 theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))
```

```
readings[['Humidity']][readings[['Humidity']] > 50] <- NA
ggplot(readings) +
 geom_line(aes(ComputerTime, Humidity), color = '#9D5863') +
 scale_y_continuous(name = 'Relative Humidity (Rh)') +
 scale_x_datetime(name = '', date_breaks = '2 days') +
 theme_tr(base_size = 18) +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))
```

And that’s it. You have your very own indoor climate monitoring system andtime series data to play around with at home.
