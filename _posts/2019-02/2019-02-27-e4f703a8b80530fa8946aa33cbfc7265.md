**Minkowski Weighted K-Means (MWK-Means)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al. (2008, 2004, 2005) is extended to the corresponding Minkowski metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.The problem we are tracking here relates to the fact that K-Means treats all features in a dataset as if they had the same degree of relevance. However, we do know that in most datasets different features will have different degrees of relevance. It is not just a matter of feature selection (in which we say: features a and b are relevant but c isn’t), but of feature weighting. … 

**Argumentation Framework With Recursive Attacks (AFRA)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The issue of representing attacks to attacks in argumentation is receiving an increasing attention as a useful conceptual modelling tool in several contexts. In this paper we present AFRA, a formalism encompassing unlimited recursive attacks within argumentation frameworks. AFRA satisfies the basic requirements of definition simplicity and rigorous compatibility with Dung’s theory of argumentation. This paper provides a complete development of the AFRA formalism complemented by illustrative examples and a detailed comparison with other recursive attack formalizations. … 

**Real Logic** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose real logic: a uniform framework for integrating automatic learning and reasoning. Real logic is defined on a full first-order language where formulas have truth-value in the interval [0,1] and semantics defined concretely on the domain of real numbers. Logical constants are interpreted as (feature) vectors of real numbers. Real logic promotes a well-founded integration of deductive reasoning on knowledge-bases with efficient, data-driven relational machine learning. We show how Real Logic can be implemented in deep Tensor Neural Networks with the use of Google’s TensorFlow primitives. The paper concludes with experiments on a simple but representative example of knowledge completion. …
