**Markov Decision Process for Diversifying the Search Results in Information Retrieval (MDP-DIV)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recently, some studies have utilized the Markov Decision Process for diversifying (MDP-DIV) the search results in information retrieval. Though promising performances can be delivered, MDP-DIV suffers from a very slow convergence, which hinders its usability in real applications. In this paper, we aim to promote the performance of MDP-DIV by speeding up the convergence rate without much accuracy sacrifice. The slow convergence is incurred by two main reasons: the large action space and data scarcity. On the one hand, the sequential decision making at each position needs to evaluate the query-document relevance for all the candidate set, which results in a huge searching space for MDP; on the other hand, due to the data scarcity, the agent has to proceed more ‘trial and error’ interactions with the environment. To tackle this problem, we propose MDP-DIV-kNN and MDP-DIV-NTN methods. The MDP-DIV-kNN method adopts a $k$ nearest neighbor strategy, i.e., discarding the $k$ nearest neighbors of the recently-selected action (document), to reduce the diversification searching space. The MDP-DIV-NTN employs a pre-trained diversification neural tensor network (NTN-DIV) as the evaluation model, and combines the results with MDP to produce the final ranking solution. The experiment results demonstrate that the two proposed methods indeed accelerate the convergence rate of the MDP-DIV, which is 3x faster, while the accuracies produced barely degrade, or even are better. … 

**Mislabeled VAE** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Class labels are often imperfectly observed, due to mistakes and to genuine ambiguity among classes. We propose a new semi-supervised deep generative model that explicitly models noisy labels, called the Mislabeled VAE (M-VAE). The M-VAE can perform better than existing deep generative models which do not account for label noise. Additionally, the derivation of M-VAE gives new theoretical insights into the popular M1+M2 semi-supervised model. … 

**Memory Replay GAN (MeRGAN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Previous works on sequential learning address the problem of forgetting in discriminative models. In this paper we consider the case of generative models. In particular, we investigate generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the task of learning new categories in a sequential fashion. We first show that sequential fine tuning renders the network unable to properly generate images from previous categories (i.e. forgetting). Addressing this problem, we propose Memory Replay GANs (MeRGANs), a conditional GAN framework that integrates a memory replay generator. We study two methods to prevent forgetting by leveraging these replays, namely joint training with replay and replay alignment. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results in MNIST, SVHN and LSUN datasets show that our memory replay approach can generate competitive images while significantly mitigating the forgetting of previous categories …
