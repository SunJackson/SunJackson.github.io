Not always is the answer 42 as explained in Hitchhikerâ€™s guide. Sometimes it is also 6174.

Kaprekar number is one of those gems, that makes Mathematics fun. Indian recreational mathematician D.R.Kaprekar, found number 6174 â€“ also known as Kaprekar constant â€“ that will return the subtraction result when following this rules:

1. Take any four-digit number, with minimum of two different numbers (1122 or 5151 or 1001 or 4375 and so on.)

1. Sort the taken number and sort it descending order and ascending order.

1. Subtract the descending number from ascending number.

1. Repeat step 2. and 3. until you get the result 6174


In practice, e.g.: number 5462, the steps would be:

or for number 6235:

Based on different number, the steps might vary.

Function for Kaprekar is:

 

Function can be used as:

and it will return all the intermediate steps until the function converges.

And to make the matter more interesting, let us find the distribution, based on all valid four-digit numbers, and append the number of steps needed to find the constant.

First, we will find the solutions for all four-digit numbers and store the solution in dataframe.

Create the empty dataframe:

And then run the following loop:

 

Fifteen seconds later, I got the dataframe with solutions for all valid (valid solutions are those that comply with step 1 and have converged within 10 steps) four-digit numbers.

Now we can add some distribution, to see how solutions are being presented with numbers. Summary of the solutions shows in average 4,6 iteration (mathematical subtractions) were needed in order to come to number 6174.

But adding the counts to steps, we get the most frequent solutions:

With some additional visual, you can see the results as well:

And the graph:

A lot of numbers converges on third step, meaning that every 4th or 5th number. We would need to look into the steps of the solutions, what these numbers have in common. This will follow! So stay tuned.

Fun fact: For the time of writing this blog post, the number 6174 was not constant in R base. ![](https://i0.wp.com/s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)

As always, code is available at Github.
