**May 14th – 15****th****|Introduction to R** 

With practical tips and exercises, this introductory course serves as a basis for the further use of R in individual applications. The aim of the course is to teach the logic and terminology of R to participants without profound and previous knowledge in order to develop the fundament for independent work.  

**May 16th – 17t****h****|Introduction in Machine Learning with R** 

In this introductory course you will gain an insight into machine learning algorithms. Besides developing own models, you will also learn what challenges you will face and how to master them in order to develop artificial intelligence applications based on your data. 

In this introduction, we will teach you the skills you need for implementing machine learning processes independently in R by using practical examples and exercises.  

* **Notice: Both courses are held in German!***
