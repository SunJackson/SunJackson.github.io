Once in a while, you might find yourself wanting to embed one plot within another plot. `ggplot2` makes this really easy with the `annotation_custom` function. The following example illustrates how you can achieve this. (For all the code in one R file, click here.)

Let’s generate some random data and make a scatterplot along with a smoothed estimate of the relationship:

The smoother seems to be doing a good job of capturing the relationship for most of the plot, but it looks like there’s something more going on in the ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5B0%2C+0.5%5D&bg=ffffff&%23038;fg=333333&%23038;s=0)

 region. Let’s zoom in:

That certainly seems like a meaningful relationship! While we might want to plot `p1` to depict the overall relationship, it is probably a good idea to show `p2` as well. This can be achieved very easily:

The first argument is for `annotation_custom` must be a “grob” (what is a grob? see details here) which we can create using the `ggplotGrob` function. The 4 other arguments (`xmin` etc.) indicate the coordinate limits for the inset: these coordinates are with reference to the axes of the outer plot. As explained in the documentation, the inset will try to fill up the space indicated by these 4 arguments while being center-justified.

For `ggmap` objects, we need to use `inset` instead of `annotation_custom`. We illustrate this by making a map of continental USA with insets for Alaska and Hawaii.

Let’s get a map of continental US (for more details on how to use Stamen maps, see my post here):

Next, let’s get maps for Alaska and Hawaii and save them into R variables. Each plot will have a title for the state, and information on the axes will be removed.

![](https://statisticaloddsandends.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/map3.png?w=456)


We can then use `inset` twice to embed these two plots (I had to fiddle around with the `xmin` etc. options to get it to come out right):
