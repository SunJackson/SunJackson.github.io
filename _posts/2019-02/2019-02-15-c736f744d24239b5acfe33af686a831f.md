**Position Summary:**

Known for its scientific and operational excellence, Regeneron is a leading science-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Regeneron commercializes medicines for eye diseases, high LDL-cholesterol, atopic dermatitis and a rare inflammatory condition and has product candidates in development in other areas of high unmet medical need, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, pain, cancer and infectious diseases.

**Summary:**

We are looking for an R&D Spark Developer to join the Genome Informatics team to expand the RGC’s big data infrastructure and develop new algorithms/tools to support various workflows/analyses throughout the RGC and Regeneron. Specifically, the candidate will collaborate closely with various team members at the RGC to (i) establish efficient data representations for genotypes, phenotypes and association results, (ii) implement scalable production workflows, and (iii) develop novel machine learning approaches to uncover new relationships between genotypes and phenotypes.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in computer science specializing in distributed systems and/or machine learning, experience in analyzing large datasets, and have strong communication skills as this job requires collaboration among multiple cross-functional teams.

This position will provide exciting opportunities to work on the bleeding edge of genome informatics and genomic medicine. The RGC hosts a vast amount of data encompassing thousands of phenotypes derived from electronic medical records, integrated with genomic data. Together, these represent a landmark collection of information that will move precision medicine and novel therapeutic discovery forward as a new data-driven paradigm in healthcare.

**Responsibilities:**

Build out a big data distributed architecture capable of efficiently processing terabytes of genomic and clinical data
Develop algorithms and tools to analyze large data sets consisting of billions of rows
Develop and deploy machine learning algorithms
Develop new web applications used by Regeneron scientists to analyze genomic and clinical datasets
Build automation around various components of the system
Interact and collaborate with other scientists to clearly define and iterate on requirements
Keep abreast of new state-of-the-art software technologies and best-practices including: Spark, Hadoop, various NoSQL databases, AWS, React, and Functional Programming

This position requires a MS (Ph.D. preferred) with 3 or more years of experience in computer science specializing in distributed systems and/or machine learning.

**Additional requirements include:**

Expertise in large distributed systems, such as Spark, Hadoop, or related frameworks/databases is essential
3+ years of software engineering experience in a modern Object Oriented or Functional language (e.g., Scala)
Experience in developing and applying machine learning algorithms
Experience with client side software development (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS, D3)
Excellent communication and presentation skills required
Working knowledge of SQL
Experience with cloud computing (AWS preferred)
Familiarity with genomics and bioinformatics is preferred, but not required
