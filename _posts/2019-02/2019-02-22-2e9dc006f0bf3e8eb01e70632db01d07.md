This journey started almost exactly a year ago, but it’s finally been sufficiently worked through and merged! Yay, I’ve officially contributed to the tidyverse (minor as it may be).

It began with a tweet, recalling a surprise I encountered that day during some routine data processing

 

For those of you not so comfortable with pipes and `dplyr`, I was trying to subset a `data.frame` ‘`data`‘ (with a column `g` having values `"W"`, `"X_Y"` and `"Z"`) to only those rows for which the column `g` had the value `"X_Y"` or `"Z"` (not the actual values, of course, but that’s the idea). Without `dplyr` this might simply be

To make that more concrete, let’s actually show it in action

`filter` isn’t at fault here — the same issue would arise with `[` — I have mis-specified the values I wish to match, so I am returned only the matching values. `%in%` is also performing its job – it returns a logical vector; the result of comparing the values in the column `g` to the vector `c("X Y", "Z")`. Both of these functions are behaving as they should, but the logic of what I was trying to achieve (subset to only these values) was lost.

Now, in some instances, that is exactly the behaviour you want — subset this vector to *any* of these values… where those values may not be present in the vector to begin with

The problem, for me, is that there isn’t a way to say “all of these should be there”. The lack of matching happens silently. If you make a typo, you don’t get that level, and you aren’t told that it’s been skipped

Technically this is a double-post because I also want to sidenote this with something I am amazed I have not known about yet (I was approximately today years old when I learned about this)… I’ve used `regex`matching for a while, and have been surprised at how well I’ve been able to make it work occasionally. I’m familiar with counting patterns (`(A){2}` to match two occurrences of `A`) and ranges of counts (`(A){2,4}` to match between two and four occurrences of `A`) but I was not aware that you can specify a number of ***mistakes*** that can be included to still make a match… 

(“Are you matching to me?”… “No, my regex *also matches to ‘Bort’”)*

Use `(pattern){~n}`to allow up to `n`substitutions in the pattern matching. Refer here and here.

Back to the original problem — `filter`and `%in%`are doing their jobs, but we aren’t getting the result we want because we made a typo, and we aren’t told that we’ve done so.

Enter a new PR to `forcats`(originally to `dplyr`, but `forcats`does make more sense) which implements `fct_match(f, lvls)`. This checks that all of the values in `lvls`are actually present in `f`before returning the logical vector of which entries they correspond to. With this, the pattern becomes (after loading the development version of `forcats`from github)

Yay! We’re notified that we’ve made an error. `"X Y"`isn’t actually in our column `g`. If we don’t make the error, we get the result we actually wanted in the first place. We can now use this successfully

It took a while for the PR to be addressed (the tidyverse crew have plenty of backlog, no doubt) but after some minor requested changes and a very neat cleanup by Hadley himself, it’s been merged.

My original version had a few bells and whistles that the current implementation has put aside. The first was inverting the matching with `fct_exclude`to make it easier to negate the matching without having to create a new anonymous function, i.e. `~!fct_match(.x)`. I find this particularly useful since a pipe expects a call/named function, not a lambda/anonymous function, which is actually quite painful to construct

whereas if we defined

we can use

The other was specifying whether or not to include missing levels when considering if `lvls` is a valid value in `f` since `unique(f)` and `levels(f)` can return different answers.

The cleanup really made me think about how much ‘fluff’ some of my code can have. Sure, it’s nice to encapsulate some logic in a small additional function, but sometimes you can actually replace all of that with a one-liner and not need all that. If you’re ever in the mood to see how compact internal code can really be, check out the source of `forcats`.

Hopefully this pattern of `filter(fct_match(f, lvls))` is useful to others. It’s certainly going to save me overlooking some typos.
