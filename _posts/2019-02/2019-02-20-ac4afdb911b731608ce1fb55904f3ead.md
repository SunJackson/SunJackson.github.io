Hello, R_users!

We are very excited to inform you that the eRum2020 (European R Users Meeting) will be held in **Milan in 2020!**

 

**About Conference**

The **eRum** is a conference that takes place every 2 years in **Europe**, every time in a different country, and is designed to create a community of European R users and to share knowledge and passion within it.

In 2018, eRum2018 took place in **Budapest, Hungary**. More than 500 attendees and over 90 speakers participated, and we expect an even wider contribution for this edition.

 

**Info and Contacts**

We will let you know the dates, the location and the program of **eRum2020** as soon as it is all set. Follow us on Twitter at @erum2020_conf to keep updated!

 

**The Support**

We will work hard to keep the registration fees as low as possible. If you want to support the success of this event, please get in touch with us, and we will provide you every info about the sponsorship opportunities.

At the moment we wish to thank Quantide**, **a Milano based company of R training and consulting, which is already **proudly supporting **this wonderful adventure.

 

We would like to thank the whole community of R, our MilanoR community and all the organizers of the previous editions.

 

Thank you so much for your attention; we are eager to meet you in Milan!
