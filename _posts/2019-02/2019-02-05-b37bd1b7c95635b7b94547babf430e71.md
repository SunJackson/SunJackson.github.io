**Deep Recurrent Factor Model: Interpretable Non-Linear and Time-Varying Multi-Factor Model**

A linear multi-factor model is one of the most important tools in equity portfolio management. The linear multi-factor models are widely used because they can be easily interpreted. However, financial markets are not linear and their accuracy is limited. Recently, deep learning methods were proposed to predict stock return in terms of the multi-factor model. Although these methods perform quite well, they have significant disadvantages such as a lack of transparency and limitations in the interpretability of the prediction. It is thus difficult for institutional investors to use black-box-type machine learning techniques in actual investment practice because they should show accountability to their customers. Consequently, the solution we propose is based on LSTM with LRP. Specifically, we extend the linear multi-factor model to be non-linear and time-varying with LSTM. Then, we approximate and linearize the learned LSTM models by LRP. We call this LSTM+LRP model a deep recurrent factor model. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of the Japanese stock market and show that our recurrent model has better predictive capability than the traditional linear model and fully-connected deep learning methods.

**Learning to Clean: A GAN Perspective**

In the big data era, the impetus to digitize the vast reservoirs of data trapped in unstructured scanned documents such as invoices, bank documents and courier receipts has gained fresh momentum. The scanning process often results in the introduction of artifacts such as background noise, blur due to camera motion, watermarkings, coffee stains, or faded text. These artifacts pose many readability challenges to current text recognition algorithms and significantly degrade their performance. Existing learning based denoising techniques require a dataset comprising of noisy documents paired with cleaned versions. In such scenarios, a model can be trained to generate clean documents from noisy versions. However, very often in the real world such a paired dataset is not available, and all we have for training our denoising model are unpaired sets of noisy and clean images. This paper explores the use of GANs to generate denoised versions of the noisy documents. In particular, where paired information is available, we formulate the problem as an image-to-image translation task i.e, translating a document from noisy domain ( i.e., background noise, blurred, faded, watermarked ) to a target clean document using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). However, in the absence of paired images for training, we employed CycleGAN which is known to learn a mapping between the distributions of the noisy images to the denoised images using unpaired data to achieve image-to-image translation for cleaning the noisy documents. We compare the performance of CycleGAN for document cleaning tasks using unpaired images with a Conditional GAN trained on paired data from the same dataset. Experiments were performed on a public document dataset on which different types of noise were artificially induced, results demonstrate that CycleGAN learns a more robust mapping from the space of noisy to clean documents.

**Causal Proportional Hazards Estimation with a Binary Instrumental Variable**

Instrumental variables (IV) are a useful tool for estimating causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. IV methods are well developed for uncensored outcomes, particularly for structural linear equation models, where simple two-stage estimation schemes are available. The extension of these methods to survival settings is challenging, partly because of the nonlinearity of the popular survival regression models and partly because of the complications associated with right censoring or other survival features. We develop a simple causal hazard ratio estimator in a proportional hazards model with right censored data. The method exploits a special characterization of IV which enables the use of an intuitive inverse weighting scheme that is generally applicable to more complex survival settings with left truncation, competing risks, or recurrent events. We rigorously establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators, and provide plug-in variance estimators. The proposed method can be implemented in standard software, and is evaluated through extensive simulation studies. We apply the proposed IV method to a data set from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial to delineate the causal effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on colorectal cancer survival which may be confounded by informative noncompliance with the assigned screening regimen.

**HyperGAN: A Generative Model for Diverse, Performant Neural Networks**

We introduce HyperGAN, a generative network that learns to generate all the weights within a deep neural network. HyperGAN employs a novel mixer to transform independent Gaussian noise into a latent space where dimensions are correlated, which is then transformed to generate weights in each layer of a deep neural network. We utilize an architecture that bears resemblance to generative adversarial networks, but we evaluate the likelihood of samples with a classification loss. This is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence between the generated network parameter distribution and an unknown true parameter distribution. We apply HyperGAN to classification, showing that HyperGAN can learn to generate parameters which solve the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with competitive performance to fully supervised learning, while learning a rich distribution of effective parameters. We also show that HyperGAN can also provide better uncertainty than standard ensembles. This is evaluated by the ability of HyperGAN generated ensembles to detect out of distribution data as well as adversarial examples. We see that in addition to being highly accurate on inlier data, HyperGAN can provide reasonable uncertainty estimates.

**A Comparative Analysis of Expected and Distributional Reinforcement Learning**

Since their introduction a year ago, distributional approaches to reinforcement learning (distributional RL) have produced strong results relative to the standard approach which models expected values (expected RL). However, aside from convergence guarantees, there have been few theoretical results investigating the reasons behind the improvements distributional RL provides. In this paper we begin the investigation into this fundamental question by analyzing the differences in the tabular, linear approximation, and non-linear approximation settings. We prove that in many realizations of the tabular and linear approximation settings, distributional RL behaves exactly the same as expected RL. In cases where the two methods behave differently, distributional RL can in fact hurt performance when it does not induce identical behaviour. We then continue with an empirical analysis comparing distributional and expected RL methods in control settings with non-linear approximators to tease apart where the improvements from distributional RL methods are coming from.

**Neuroevolution with Perceptron Turing Machines**

We introduce the perceptron Turing machine and show how it can be used to create a system of neuroevolution. Advantages of this approach include automatic scaling of solutions to larger problem sizes, the ability to experiment with hand-coded solutions, and an enhanced potential for understanding evolved solutions. Hand-coded solutions may be implemented in the low-level language of Turing machines, which is the genotype used in neuroevolution, but a high-level language called Lopro is introduced to make the job easier.

**Code Farming: A Process for Creating Generic Computational Building Blocks**

Motivated by a desire to improve on the current state of the art in genetic programming, and aided by recent progress in understanding the computational aspects of evolutionary systems, we describe a process that creates a set of generic computational building blocks for the purpose of seeding initial populations of programs in any genetic programming system. This provides an advantage over the standard approach of initializing the population purely randomly in that it avoids the need to constantly rediscover such building blocks. It is also better than seeding the initial population with hand-coded building blocks, since it lessens the amount of human intervention required by the system.

**A Generalized Language Model in Tensor Space**

In the literature, tensors have been effectively used for capturing the context information in language models. However, the existing methods usually adopt relatively-low order tensors, which have limited expressive power in modeling language. Developing a higher-order tensor representation is challenging, in terms of deriving an effective solution and showing its generality. In this paper, we propose a language model named Tensor Space Language Model (TSLM), by utilizing tensor networks and tensor decomposition. In TSLM, we build a high-dimensional semantic space constructed by the tensor product of word vectors. Theoretically, we prove that such tensor representation is a generalization of the n-gram language model. We further show that this high-order tensor representation can be decomposed to a recursive calculation of conditional probability for language modeling. The experimental results on Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset and WikiText benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of TSLM.

**Unsupervised Prediction of Negative Health Events Ahead of Time**

The emergence of continuous health monitoring and the availability of an enormous amount of time series data has provided a great opportunity for the advancement of personal health tracking. In recent years, unsupervised learning methods have drawn special attention of researchers to tackle the sparse annotation of health data and real-time detection of anomalies has been a central problem of interest. However, one problem that has not been well addressed before is the early prediction of forthcoming negative health events. Early signs of an event can introduce subtle and gradual changes in the health signal prior to its onset, detection of which can be invaluable in effective prevention. In this study, we first demonstrate our observations on the shortcoming of widely adopted anomaly detection methods in uncovering the changes prior to a negative health event. We then propose a framework which relies on online clustering of signal segment representations which are automatically learned by a specially designed LSTM auto-encoder. We show the effectiveness of our approach by predicting Bradycardia events in infants using MIT-PICS dataset 1.3 minutes ahead of time with 68\% AUC score on average, using no label supervision. Results of our study can indicate the viability of our approach in the early detection of health events in other applications as well.

**Peer-to-peer Federated Learning on Graphs**

We consider the problem of training a machine learning model over a network of nodes in a fully decentralized framework. The nodes take a Bayesian-like approach via the introduction of a belief over the model parameter space. We propose a distributed learning algorithm in which nodes update their belief by aggregate information from their one-hop neighbors to learn a model that best fits the observations over the entire network. In addition, we also obtain sufficient conditions to ensure that the probability of error is small for every node in the network. We discuss approximations required for applying this algorithm to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Experiments on training linear regression model and on training a DNN show that the proposed learning rule algorithm provides a significant improvement in the accuracy compared to the case where nodes learn without cooperation.

**EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks**

We present EDA: easy data augmentation techniques for boosting performance on text classification tasks. EDA consists of four simple but powerful operations: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, and random deletion. On five text classification tasks, we show that EDA improves performance for both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. EDA demonstrates particularly strong results for smaller datasets; on average, across five datasets, training with EDA while using only 50% of the available training set achieved the same accuracy as normal training with all available data. We also performed extensive ablation studies and suggest parameters for practical use.

**Accuracy vs. Efficiency: Achieving Both through FPGA-Implementation Aware Neural Architecture Search**

A fundamental question lies in almost every application of deep neural networks: what is the optimal neural architecture given a specific dataset? Recently, several Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks have been developed that use reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithm to search for the solution. However, most of them take a long time to find the optimal architecture due to the huge search space and the lengthy training process needed to evaluate each candidate. In addition, most of them aim at accuracy only and do not take into consideration the hardware that will be used to implement the architecture. This will potentially lead to excessive latencies beyond specifications, rendering the resulting architectures useless. To address both issues, in this paper we use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as a vehicle to present a novel hardware-aware NAS framework, namely FNAS, which will provide an optimal neural architecture with latency guaranteed to meet the specification. In addition, with a performance abstraction model to analyze the latency of neural architectures without training, our framework can quickly prune architectures that do not satisfy the specification, leading to higher efficiency. Experimental results on common data set such as ImageNet show that in the cases where the state-of-the-art generates architectures with latencies 7.81x longer than the specification, those from FNAS can meet the specs with less than 1% accuracy loss. Moreover, FNAS also achieves up to 11.13x speedup for the search process. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the very first hardware aware NAS.

**Multistage Knapsack**

Many systems have to be maintained while the underlying constraints, costs and/or profits change over time. Although the state of a system may evolve during time, a non-negligible transition cost is incured for transitioning from one state to another. In order to model such situations, Gupta et al. (ICALP 2014) and Eisenstat et al. (ICALP 2014) introduced a multistage model where the input is a sequence of instances (one for each time step), and the goal is to find a sequence of solutions (one for each time step) that are both (i) near optimal for each time step and (ii) as stable as possible. We focus on the multistage version of the Knapsack problem where we are given a time horizon t=1,2,…,T, and a sequence of knapsack instances I_1,I_2,…,I_T, one for each time step, defined on a set of n objects. In every time step t we have to choose a feasible knapsack S_t of I_t, which gives a knapsack profit. To measure the stability/similarity of two consecutive solutions S_t and S_{t+1}, we identify the objects for which the decision, to be picked or not, remains the same in S_t and S_{t+1}, giving a transition profit. We are asked to produce a sequence of solutions S_1,S_2,…,S_T so that the total knapsack profit plus the overall transition profit is maximized. We propose a PTAS for the Multistage Knapsack problem. Then, we prove that there is no FPTAS for the problem even in the case where T=2, unless P=NP. Furthermore, we give a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for the case where the number of steps is bounded by a fixed constant and we show that otherwise the problem remains NP-hard even in the case where all the weights, profits and capacities are 0 or 1.

**A Theory of Regularized Markov Decision Processes**

Many recent successful (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms make use of regularization, generally based on entropy or on Kullback-Leibler divergence. We propose a general theory of regularized Markov Decision Processes that generalizes these approaches in two directions: we consider a larger class of regularizers, and we consider the general modified policy iteration approach, encompassing both policy iteration and value iteration. The core building blocks of this theory are a notion of regularized Bellman operator and the Legendre-Fenchel transform, a classical tool of convex optimization. This approach allows for error propagation analyses of general algorithmic schemes of which (possibly variants of) classical algorithms such as Trust Region Policy Optimization, Soft Q-learning, Stochastic Actor Critic or Dynamic Policy Programming are special cases. This also draws connections to proximal convex optimization, especially to Mirror Descent.

**Hyperbox based machine learning algorithms: A comprehensive survey**

With the rapid development of digital information, the data volume generated by humans and machines is growing exponentially. Along with this trend, machine learning algorithms have been formed and evolved continuously to discover new information and knowledge from different data sources. Learning algorithms using hyperboxes as fundamental representational and building blocks are a branch of machine learning methods. These algorithms have enormous potential for high scalability and online adaptation of predictors built in this way to the dynamically changing environments and streaming data. This paper aims to give a comprehensive survey of literature on hyperbox-based machine learning models. In general, according to the architecture and characteristic features of the resulting models, the existing hyperbox-based learning algorithms may be grouped into three major categories: fuzzy min-max neural networks, hyperbox-based hybrid models, and other algorithms based on hyperbox representation. Within each of these groups, this paper shows a brief description of the structure of models, associated learning algorithms, and an analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. Main applications of these hyperbox-based models to the real-world problems are also described in this paper. Finally, we discuss some open problems and identify potential future research directions in this field.

**New Tricks for Estimating Gradients of Expectations**

We derive a family of Monte Carlo estimators for gradients of expectations of univariate distributions, which is related to the log-derivative trick, but involves pairwise interactions between samples. The first of these comes from either a) introducing and approximating an integral representation based on the fundamental theorem of calculus, or b) applying the reparameterisation trick to an implicit parameterisation under infinitesimal perturbation of the parameters. From the former perspective we generalise to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space representation, giving rise to locality parameter in the pairwise interactions mentioned above. The resulting estimators are unbiased and shown to offer an independent component of useful information in comparison with the log-derivative estimator. Promising analytical and numerical examples confirm the intuitions behind the new estimators.

**Generalized Dirichlet-process-means for f-separable distortion measures**

DP-means clustering was obtained as an extension of K-means clustering. While it is implemented with a simple and efficient algorithm, it can estimate the number of clusters simultaneously. However, DP-means is specifically designed for the average distortion measure. Therefore, it is vulnerable to outliers in data, and it can cause large maximum distortion in clusters. In this work, we extend the objective function of the DP-means to f-separable distortion measures and propose a unified learning algorithm to overcome the above problems by the selection of the function f. Furthermore, the influence function of the estimated cluster center is analyzed to evaluate the robustness against outliers. We show the effectiveness of the generalized method by numerical experiments using real datasets.

**Optimization of the Area Under the ROC Curve using Neural Network Supervectors for Text-Dependent Speaker Verification**

This paper explores two techniques to improve the performance of text-dependent speaker verification systems based on deep neural networks. Firstly, we propose a general alignment mechanism to keep the temporal structure of each phrase and obtain a supervector with the speaker and phrase information, since both are relevant for a text-dependent verification. As we show, it is possible to use different alignment techniques to replace the average pooling providing significant gains in performance. Moreover, we present a novel back-end approach to train a neural network for detection tasks by optimizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as an alternative to the usual triplet loss function, so the system is end-to-end, with a cost function closed to our desired measure of performance. As we can see in the experimental section, this approach improves the system performance, since our triplet AUC neural network learns how to discriminate between pairs of examples from the same identity and pairs of different identities. The different alignment techniques to produce supervectors in addition to the new back-end approach were tested on the RSR2015-Part I database for text-dependent speaker verification, providing competitive results compared to similar size networks using the average pooling to extract supervectors and using a simple back-end or triplet loss training.

**Determining the Dimension and Structure of the Subspace Correlated Across Multiple Data Sets**

Detecting the components common or correlated across multiple data sets is challenging due to a large number of possible correlation structures among the components. Even more challenging is to determine the precise structure of these correlations. Traditional work has focused on determining only the model order, i.e., the dimension of the correlated subspace, a number that depends on how the model-order problem is defined. Moreover, identifying the model order is often not enough to understand the relationship among the components in different data sets. We aim at solving the complete modelselection problem, i.e., determining which components are correlated across which data sets. We prove that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normalized covariance matrix of the composite data vector, under certain conditions, completely characterize the underlying correlation structure. We use these results to solve the model-selection problem by employing bootstrap-based hypothesis testing.

**Learning and Evaluating General Linguistic Intelligence**

We define general linguistic intelligence as the ability to reuse previously acquired knowledge about a language’s lexicon, syntax, semantics, and pragmatic conventions to adapt to new tasks quickly. Using this definition, we analyze state-of-the-art natural language understanding models and conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate them against these criteria through a series of experiments that assess the task-independence of the knowledge being acquired by the learning process. In addition to task performance, we propose a new evaluation metric based on an online encoding of the test data that quantifies how quickly an existing agent (model) learns a new task. Our results show that while the field has made impressive progress in terms of model architectures that generalize to many tasks, these models still require a lot of in-domain training examples (e.g., for fine tuning, training task-specific modules), and are prone to catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, we find that far from solving general tasks (e.g., document question answering), our models are overfitting to the quirks of particular datasets (e.g., SQuAD). We discuss missing components and conjecture on how to make progress toward general linguistic intelligence.

**Successor Features Support Model-based and Model-free Reinforcement Learning**

One key challenge in reinforcement learning is the ability to generalize knowledge in control problems. While deep learning methods have been successfully combined with model-free reinforcement-learning algorithms, how to perform model-based reinforcement learning in the presence of approximation errors still remains an open problem. Using successor features, a feature representation that predicts a temporal constraint, this paper presents three contributions: First, it shows how learning successor features is equivalent to model-free learning. Then, it shows how successor features encode model reductions that compress the state space by creating state partitions of bisimilar states. Using this representation, an intelligent agent is guaranteed to accurately predict future reward outcomes, a key property of model-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. Lastly, it presents a loss objective and prediction error bounds showing that accurately predicting value functions and reward sequences is possible with an approximation of successor features. On finite control problems, we illustrate how minimizing this loss objective results in approximate bisimulations. The results presented in this paper provide a novel understanding of representations that can support model-free and model-based reinforcement learning.

**The SuperM-Tree: Indexing metric spaces with sized objects**

A common approach to implementing similarity search applications is the usage of distance functions, where small distances indicate high similarity. In the case of metric distance functions, metric index structures can be used to accelerate nearest neighbor queries. On the other hand, many applications ask for approximate subsequences or subsets, e.g. searching for a similar partial sequence of a gene, for a similar scene in a movie, or for a similar object in a picture which is represented by a set of multidimensional features. Metric index structures such as the M-Tree cannot be utilized for these tasks because of the symmetry of the metric distance functions. In this work, we propose the SuperM-Tree as an extension of the M-Tree where approximate subsequence and subset queries become nearest neighbor queries. In order to do this, we introduce metric subset spaces as a generalized concept of metric spaces. Various metric distance functions can be extended to metric subset distance functions, e.g. the Euclidean distance (on windows), the Hausdorff distance (on subsets), the Edit distance and the Dog-Keeper distance (on subsequences). We show that these examples subsume the applications mentioned above.

**Funnelling: A New Ensemble Method for Heterogeneous Transfer Learning and its Application to Polylingual Text Classification**

Polylingual Text Classification (PLC) consists of automatically classifying, according to a common set C of classes, documents each written in one of a set of languages L, and doing so more accurately than when naively classifying each document via its corresponding language-specific classifier. In order to obtain an increase in the classification accuracy for a given language, the system thus needs to also leverage the training examples written in the other languages. We tackle multilabel PLC via funnelling, a new ensemble learning method that we propose here. Funnelling consists of generating a two-tier classification system where all documents, irrespectively of language, are classified by the same (2nd-tier) classifier. For this classifier all documents are represented in a common, language-independent feature space consisting of the posterior probabilities generated by 1st-tier, language-dependent classifiers. This allows the classification of all test documents, of any language, to benefit from the information present in all training documents, of any language. We present substantial experiments, run on publicly available polylingual text collections, in which funnelling is shown to significantly outperform a number of state-of-the-art baselines. All code and datasets (in vector form) are made publicly available.

**Minimizing Negative Transfer of Knowledge in Multivariate Gaussian Processes: A Scalable and Regularized Approach**

Recently there has been an increasing interest in the multivariate Gaussian process (MGP) which extends the Gaussian process (GP) to deal with multiple outputs. One approach to construct the MGP and account for non-trivial commonalities amongst outputs employs a convolution process (CP). The CP is based on the idea of sharing latent functions across several convolutions. Despite the elegance of the CP construction, it provides new challenges that need yet to be tackled. First, even with a moderate number of outputs, model building is extremely prohibitive due to the huge increase in computational demands and number of parameters to be estimated. Second, the negative transfer of knowledge may occur when some outputs do not share commonalities. In this paper we address these issues. We propose a regularized pairwise modeling approach for the MGP established using CP. The key feature of our approach is to distribute the estimation of the full multivariate model into a group of bivariate GPs which are individually built. Interestingly pairwise modeling turns out to possess unique characteristics, which allows us to tackle the challenge of negative transfer through penalizing the latent function that facilitates information sharing in each bivariate model. Predictions are then made through combining predictions from the bivariate models within a Bayesian framework. The proposed method has excellent scalability when the number of outputs is large and minimizes the negative transfer of knowledge between uncorrelated outputs. Statistical guarantees for the proposed method are studied and its advantageous features are demonstrated through numerical studies.

**ProBO: a Framework for Using Probabilistic Programming in Bayesian Optimization**

Optimizing an expensive-to-query function is a common task in science and engineering, where it is beneficial to keep the number of queries to a minimum. A popular strategy is Bayesian optimization (BO), which leverages probabilistic models for this task. Most BO today uses Gaussian processes (GPs), or a few other surrogate models. However, there is a broad set of Bayesian modeling techniques that we may want to use to capture complex systems and reduce the number of queries. Probabilistic programs (PPs) are modern tools that allow for flexible model composition, incorporation of prior information, and automatic inference. In this paper, we develop ProBO, a framework for BO using only standard operations common to most PPs. This allows a user to drop in an arbitrary PP implementation and use it directly in BO. To do this, we describe black box versions of popular acquisition functions that can be used in our framework automatically, without model-specific derivation, and show how to optimize these functions. We also introduce a model, which we term the Bayesian Product of Experts, that integrates into ProBO and can be used to combine information from multiple models implemented with different PPs. We show empirical results using multiple PP implementations, and compare against standard BO methods.

**Shaping the Narrative Arc: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Collaborative Dialogue**

We consider the problem of designing an artificial agent capable of interacting with humans in collaborative dialogue to produce creative, engaging narratives. In this task, the goal is to establish universe details, and to collaborate on an interesting story in that universe, through a series of natural dialogue exchanges. Our model can augment any probabilistic conversational agent by allowing it to reason about universe information established and what potential next utterances might reveal. Ideally, with each utterance, agents would reveal just enough information to add specificity and reduce ambiguity without limiting the conversation. We empirically show that our model allows control over the rate at which the agent reveals information and that doing so significantly improves accuracy in predicting the next line of dialogues from movies. We close with a case-study with four professional theatre performers, who preferred interactions with our model-augmented agent over an unaugmented agent.
