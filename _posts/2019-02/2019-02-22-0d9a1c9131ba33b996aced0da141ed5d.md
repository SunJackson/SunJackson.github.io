### Why this article?

 Many young professionals, who have started their journey into data science, and machine learning, face a common problem — they have completed one or two basic online course, done some programming lessons, put up a couple of projects on Github, and then… then what?

> **What to learn? Where to find focused resources?**

In one of my previous articles on Medium (published by the TDS Team), I discussed, at length, **where you can find MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) for jump-starting your journey into data science and machine learning**. That article assumed the reader to be a beginner and covers essential MOOCs, which are optimized for basic and intermediate learning. You can check that one here,

**How to choose effective MOOCs for machine learning and data science?***Advice for professionals in non-CS field eager to learn and contribute to data science/machine learning. Curated from…*towardsdatascience.com

I wrote another detailed article specifically focused on the topic of mathematics concepts you need to master for data science and machine learning and which courses to study. You can check that one here,

**Essential Math for Data Science - 'Why' and 'How'***Mathematics is the bedrock of science. We discuss the essential math topics to master to become a better data scientist…*towardsdatascience.com

Recently, I have been receiving a lot of messages in my personal email and LinkedIn inbox, mostly from bright, young professionals, asking similar questions and my suggestions about online courses.

I mostly have a ready answer for those messages. I just send them a list of my articles (which, in turn, contains links and references to other highly cited articles from KDnuggets or Team AV). In most cases, I receive happy replies :-)

However, since writing those articles, I have personally taken few more ‘advanced’ courses in AI and machine learning (ML), seen discussions and reviews around few more, and naturally felt a need to update those references.

> After some thought, I decided it is best to leave the original articles, as they really cater to beginners and have served their purpose well for many readers, and try compiling a fresh list of online courses.

That’s what this article is about.

 

### What do I mean by ‘advanced’ level course?

 Advanced’ is a relative term. It is best to have a baseline to explain the word in this context. Fortunately, we almost have a gold standard when it comes to ML online MOOC — Prof. Andrew Ng’s Coursera course (the original one, not the Deeplearning.ai specialization).

Therefore, by ‘advanced’, in this article, I allude to two characteristics, which need to be present (not necessarily simultaneously) in the courses that will be discussed,

Significantly more breadth than the aforementioned course i.e. covering more advanced and diverse topics
Highly specialized focus related to AI or ML

I hope I make it clear that my intention is not to say that Prof. Ng’s course is a rudimentary one. It is still the best introduction to the world of machine learning one can ask for — particularly for beginners. But, after you finish that course, do some programming, feel comfortable about the mathematics concepts, you should build on your base and learn diverse topics.

I just hope that this article can help you do that by listing some **free MOOCs** with that singular focus.

 

### What is the singular focus for selecting the courses?

 AI and ML are hot topics and there is no dearth of free online courses covering those subjects. Although, I have found that there are a surprisingly little amount of true high-quality AI courses out there.

Yes, I am in that camp, which firmly believes that deep learning is not artificial intelligence, and therefore reject the notion of any course, having the word “AI” in its title but covering nothing more than deep learning frameworks in Python, to be classified as an AI course.

So, to restrict my listing to a limited number of high-quality courses, I laid out some simple ground rule or filters.

I tend to **avoid any course with a significant focus on a particular programming framework**/tool i.e. no course with a name like “Machine learning with Python…” (some examples or code snippets are fine)
Following the same logic, the list will have courses with a **strong emphasis on the theoretical foundation**— this mainly favors university courses over those offered by individual entrepreneurs or companies (e.g. fast.ai, Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc.)
Similarly, I included Udacity courses which are **taught by university faculty or renowned researchers** like Sebastian Thrun or Peter Norvig. I did not include their nanodegree references, which I do not find intellectually uplifting.
I put included two topics which have enormous importance for true AI learning but receive less than usual attention — **reinforcement learning** and **game theory**.
**No course focused primarily on data science/data engineering/digital analytics/applied statistics**. They all are critically important topics to learn in today’s world but I prefer to separate them cleanly from my focus on pure machine learning and AI for the sake of this particular article.

I believe this focus will automatically curate the list toward high-quality, foundational courses in AI and ML, which can benefit intermediate to advanced learners.You will be the judge, after all.

Personally, I have not taken all of these courses although I finished a significant portion of them. So, I tried to keep my comments about the courses brief and factual.

 

### The links and references

 Without further delay, here is the list.

 **General machine learning and deep learning**

These are courses covering general ML and DL topics.
