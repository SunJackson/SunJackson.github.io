**Variational Recurrent Neural Machine Translation (VRNMT)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Partially inspired by successful applications of variational recurrent neural networks, we propose a novel variational recurrent neural machine translation (VRNMT) model in this paper. Different from the variational NMT, VRNMT introduces a series of latent random variables to model the translation procedure of a sentence in a generative way, instead of a single latent variable. Specifically, the latent random variables are included into the hidden states of the NMT decoder with elements from the variational autoencoder. In this way, these variables are recurrently generated, which enables them to further capture strong and complex dependencies among the output translations at different timesteps. In order to deal with the challenges in performing efficient posterior inference and large-scale training during the incorporation of latent variables, we build a neural posterior approximator, and equip it with a reparameterization technique to estimate the variational lower bound. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significant improvements over both the conventional and variational NMT models. …

Classification of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images has three major challenges: 1) inherent low intra-class and high inter-class spectral similarities, 2) mismatching resolution of available bands, and 3) the need to regularize noisy classification maps. Conventional methods have addressed these challenges by adopting separate stages of image fusion, feature extraction, and post-classification map regularization. These processing stages, however, are not jointly optimizing the classification task at hand. In this study, we propose a single-stage framework embedding the processing stages in a recurrent multiresolution convolutional network trained in an end-to-end manner. The feedforward version of the network, called FuseNet, aims to match the resolution of the panchromatic and multispectral bands in a VHR image using convolutional layers with corresponding downsampling and upsampling operations. Contextual label information is incorporated into FuseNet by means of a recurrent version called ReuseNet. We compared FuseNet and ReuseNet against the use of separate processing steps for both image fusion, e.g. pansharpening and resampling through interpolation, and map regularization such as conditional random fields. We carried out our experiments on a land cover classification task using a Worldview-03 image of Quezon City, Philippines and the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling benchmark dataset of Vaihingen, Germany. FuseNet and ReuseNet surpass the baseline approaches in both quantitative and qualitative results. … 

**conu** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
There has been a need for a simple, easy-to-use handler for writing tests and other code around containers that would implement helpful methods and utilities. For this we introduce conu, a low-level Python library. This project has been driven from the start by the requirements of container maintainers and testers. In addition to basic image and container management methods, it provides other often used functions, such as container mount, shortcut methods for getting an IP address, exposed ports, logs, name, image extending using source-to-image, and many others. conu aims for stable engine-agnostic APIs that would be implemented by several container runtime back-ends. Switching between two different container engines should require only minimum effort. When used for testing, one set of tests could be executed for multiple back-ends. …
