**Obstacles to Operationalizing Analytics, and Strategies to Overcome Them**
|![](https://stuff.risingmedia.eu/images/speaker/6059.jpg?d=1543252454)**Dave Pahl**VP - Analytics, Insights, and Data Science **Northwestern Mutual**|**Obstacles to Operationalizing Analytics, and Strategies to Overcome Them**Getting models and analytic products "over the line" and implemented or operationalized can be challenging due to factors often outside the direct control of a modeling or analytics team. I’ll share some of the obstacles that we’ve met in our journey maturing as an Enterprise Data and Analytics organization. Some are business and organizational challenges, others are technology related. At Northwestern Mutual, we’ve successfully navigated a number of these challenges and deployed models and other analytic products for mission critical business functions. I’ll talk through some specific challenges such as getting proper buy-in, pursuit of perfection, execution approach, and more. Through some specific examples, I’ll share our approach to overcoming these challenges and getting our analytical products implemented and incorporated into business processes, resulting in revenue gains and expense reductions.|
