RateBeer puts out a list every year for top 100 breweries in the world. The rankings are based on reviews, range across styles, and historical performance (and maybe a bit of subjectivity). RateBeer just published the list for 2018. Here’s a map of the 73 U.S.-based breweries.

Here are the U.S. breweries that landed in the RateBeer top 100 this year.

# THAT MADE THE LIST PER 100 BREWERIES

For the number of breweries in the state, Alaska is killing it. You go, Alaska.

# THAT MADE THE LIST PER 100 BREWERIES





There are a couple of breweries, BrewDog and Mikkeller, that aren’t based in the United States, but they have physical tap rooms or headquarters in the U.S., so they’re also in there.

Then there’s Evil Twin, which is a gypsy brewer where the beer is made at other breweries. I just used the Brooklyn address listed on their site.

Bottom line: If you want good beer, head west or northeast. It’s a bit bare in the middle.

### Notes

- The list of best breweries comes from RateBeer. I got brewery counts per state from BreweryDB.
