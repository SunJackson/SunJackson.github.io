**Self-Supervised Visual Representations for Cross-Modal Retrieval**

Cross-modal retrieval methods have been significantly improved in last years with the use of deep neural networks and large-scale annotated datasets such as ImageNet and Places. However, collecting and annotating such datasets requires a tremendous amount of human effort and, besides, their annotations are usually limited to discrete sets of popular visual classes that may not be representative of the richer semantics found on large-scale cross-modal retrieval datasets. In this paper, we present a self-supervised cross-modal retrieval framework that leverages as training data the correlations between images and text on the entire set of Wikipedia articles. Our method consists in training a CNN to predict: (1) the semantic context of the article in which an image is more probable to appear as an illustration (global context), and (2) the semantic context of its caption (local context). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is not only capable of learning discriminative visual representations for solving vision tasks like image classification and object detection, but that the learned representations are better for cross-modal retrieval when compared to supervised pre-training of the network on the ImageNet dataset.

**Network Parameter Learning Using Nonlinear Transforms, Local Representation Goals and Local Propagation Constraints**

In this paper, we introduce a novel concept for learning of the parameters in a neural network. Our idea is grounded on modeling a learning problem that addresses a trade-off between (i) satisfying local objectives at each node and (ii) achieving desired data propagation through the network under (iii) local propagation constraints. We consider two types of nonlinear transforms which describe the network representations. One of the nonlinear transforms serves as activation function. The other one enables a locally adjusted, deviation corrective components to be included in the update of the network weights in order to enable attaining target specific representations at the last network node. Our learning principle not only provides insight into the understanding and the interpretation of the learning dynamics, but it offers theoretical guarantees over decoupled and parallel parameter estimation strategy that enables learning in synchronous and asynchronous mode. Numerical experiments validate the potential of our approach on image recognition task. The preliminary results show advantages in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, w.r.t. the learning time and the network size while having competitive recognition accuracy.

**Bridging the Semantic Gap with SQL Query Logs in Natural Language Interfaces to Databases**

A critical challenge in constructing a natural language interface to database (NLIDB) is bridging the semantic gap between a natural language query (NLQ) and the underlying data. Two specific ways this challenge exhibits itself is through keyword mapping and join path inference. Keyword mapping is the task of mapping individual keywords in the original NLQ to database elements (such as relations, attributes or values). It is challenging due to the ambiguity in mapping the user’s mental model and diction to the schema definition and contents of the underlying database. Join path inference is the process of selecting the relations and join conditions in the FROM clause of the final SQL query, and is difficult because NLIDB users lack the knowledge of the database schema or SQL and therefore cannot explicitly specify the intermediate tables and joins needed to construct a final SQL query. In this paper, we propose leveraging information from the SQL query log of a database to enhance the performance of existing NLIDBs with respect to these challenges. We present a system Templar that can be used to augment existing NLIDBs. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, leading up to 138% improvement in top-1 accuracy in existing NLIDBs by leveraging SQL query log information.

**Probabilistic Discriminative Learning with Layered Graphical Models**

Probabilistic graphical models are traditionally known for their successes in generative modeling. In this work, we advocate layered graphical models (LGMs) for probabilistic discriminative learning. To this end, we design LGMs in close analogy to neural networks (NNs), that is, they have deep hierarchical structures and convolutional or local connections between layers. Equipped with tensorized truncated variational inference, our LGMs can be efficiently trained via backpropagation on mainstream deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. To deal with continuous valued inputs, we use a simple yet effective soft-clamping strategy for efficient inference. Through extensive experiments on image classification over MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that LGMs are capable of achieving competitive results comparable to NNs of similar architectures, while preserving transparent probabilistic modeling.

**A Novel Initial Clusters Generation Method for K-means-based Clustering Algorithms for Mixed Datasets**

Mixed datasets consist of numeric and categorical attributes. Various K-means-based clustering algorithms have been developed to cluster these datasets. Generally, these clustering algorithms use random initial clusters which in turn produce different clustering results in different runs. A few cluster initialisation methods have been developed to compute initial clusters, however, they are either computationally expensive or they do not create the same clustering results in different runs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to find initial clusters for K-means-based clustering algorithms for mixed datasets. The proposed approach is based on the observation that some data points in datasets remain in the same clusters created by K-means-based clustering algorithm irrespective of the choice of initial clusters. It is proposed that individual attribute information can be used to create initial clusters. A K-means-based clustering algorithm is run many times, in each run one of the attributes is used to create initial clusters. The clustering results of various runs are combined to produce a clustering result. This clustering result is used as initial clusters for a K-means-based clustering algorithm. Experiments with various categorical and mixed datasets showed that the proposed clustering approach produced accurate and consistent results.

**Plan-Structured Deep Neural Network Models for Query Performance Prediction**

Query performance prediction, the task of predicting the latency of a query, is one of the most challenging problem in database management systems. Existing approaches rely on features and performance models engineered by human experts, but often fail to capture the complex interactions between query operators and input relations, and generally do not adapt naturally to workload characteristics and patterns in query execution plans. In this paper, we argue that deep learning can be applied to the query performance prediction problem, and we introduce a novel neural network architecture for the task: a plan-structured neural network. Our approach eliminates the need for human-crafted feature selection and automatically discovers complex performance models both at the operator and query plan level. Our novel neural network architecture can match the structure of any optimizer-selected query execution plan and predict its latency with high accuracy. We also propose a number of optimizations that reduce training overhead without sacrificing effectiveness. We evaluated our techniques on various workloads and we demonstrate that our plan-structured neural network can outperform the state-of-the-art in query performance prediction.

**Tsallis Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework for Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning**

In this paper, we present a new class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), called Tsallis Markov decision process, with Tsallis entropy maximization, which generalizes existing maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL). A Tsallis MDP provides a unified framework for the original RL problem and RL with various types of entropy, including the well-known standard Shannon-Gibbs (SG) entropy, using an additional real-valued parameter, called an entropic index. By controlling the entropic index, we can generate various types of entropy, including the SG entropy, and a different entropy results in a different class of the optimal policy in Tsallis MDPs. We also provide a full mathematical analysis of Tsallis MDPs, including the optimality condition, performance error bounds, and convergence. Our theoretical result enables us to use any positive entropic index in RL. To handle complex and large-scale problems, we propose a model-free actor-critic RL method using Tsallis entropy maximization. We evaluate the regularization effect of the Tsallis entropy with various values of entropic indices and show that the entropic index controls the exploration tendency of the proposed method. For a different type of RL problems, we find that a different value of the entropic index is desirable. The proposed method is evaluated using the MuJoCo simulator and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

**Agnostic Federated Learning**

A key learning scenario in large-scale applications is that of federated learning, where a centralized model is trained based on data originating from a large number of clients. We argue that, with the existing training and inference, federated models can be biased towards different clients. Instead, we propose a new framework of agnostic federated learning, where the centralized model is optimized for any target distribution formed by a mixture of the client distributions. We further show that this framework naturally yields a notion of fairness. We present data-dependent Rademacher complexity guarantees for learning with this objective, which guide the definition of an algorithm for agnostic federated learning. We also give a fast stochastic optimization algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem, for which we prove convergence bounds, assuming a convex loss function and hypothesis set. We further empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach in several datasets. Beyond federated learning, our framework and algorithm can be of interest to other learning scenarios such as cloud computing, domain adaptation, drifting, and other contexts where the training and test distributions do not coincide.

**Towards Collaborative Intelligence Friendly Architectures for Deep Learning**

Modern mobile devices are equipped with high-performance hardware resources such as graphics processing units (GPUs), making the end-side intelligent services more feasible. Even recently, specialized silicons as neural engines are being used for mobile devices. However, most mobile devices are still not capable of performing real-time inference using very deep models. Computations associated with deep models for today’s intelligent applications are typically performed solely on the cloud. This cloud-only approach requires significant amounts of raw data to be uploaded to the cloud over the mobile wireless network and imposes considerable computational and communication load on the cloud server. Recent studies have shown that the latency and energy consumption of deep neural networks in mobile applications can be notably reduced by splitting the workload between the mobile device and the cloud. In this approach, referred to as collaborative intelligence, intermediate features computed on the mobile device are offloaded to the cloud instead of the raw input data of the network, reducing the size of the data needed to be sent to the cloud. In this paper, we design a new collaborative intelligence friendly architecture by introducing a unit responsible for reducing the size of the feature data needed to be offloaded to the cloud to a greater extent, where this unit is placed after a selected layer of a deep model. Our proposed method, across different wireless networks, achieves on average 53x improvements for end-to-end latency and 68x improvements for mobile energy consumption compared to the status quo cloud-only approach for ResNet-50, while the accuracy loss is less than 2%.

**Compressing GANs using Knowledge Distillation**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used in several machine learning tasks such as domain transfer, super resolution, and synthetic data generation. State-of-the-art GANs often use tens of millions of parameters, making them expensive to deploy for applications in low SWAP (size, weight, and power) hardware, such as mobile devices, and for applications with real time capabilities. There has been no work found to reduce the number of parameters used in GANs. Therefore, we propose a method to compress GANs using knowledge distillation techniques, in which a smaller ‘student’ GAN learns to mimic a larger ‘teacher’ GAN. We show that the distillation methods used on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Celeb-A datasets can compress teacher GANs at ratios of 1669:1, 58:1, and 87:1, respectively, while retaining the quality of the generated image. From our experiments, we observe a qualitative limit for GAN’s compression. Moreover, we observe that, with a fixed parameter budget, compressed GANs outperform GANs trained using standard training methods. We conjecture that this is partially owing to the optimization landscape of over-parameterized GANs which allows efficient training using alternating gradient descent. Thus, training an over-parameterized GAN followed by our proposed compression scheme provides a high quality generative model with a small number of parameters.

**Private Secure Coded Computation**

We introduce a variation of coded computation that ensures data security and master’s privacy against workers, which is referred to as private secure coded computation. In private secure coded computation, the master needs to compute a function of its own dataset and one of the datasets in a library exclusively shared by external workers. After recovering the desired function, the workers must not be able to know which dataset in the library was desired by the master or obtain any information about the master’s own data. We propose a private secure coded computation scheme for matrix multiplication, namely private secure polynomial codes, based on private polynomial codes for private coded computation. In simulations, we show that the private secure polynomial codes achieves better computation time than private polynomial codes modified for private secure coded computation.

**CESI: Canonicalizing Open Knowledge Bases using Embeddings and Side Information**

Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) methods extract (noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase) triples from text, resulting in the construction of large Open Knowledge Bases (Open KBs). The noun phrases (NPs) and relation phrases in such Open KBs are not canonicalized, leading to the storage of redundant and ambiguous facts. Recent research has posed canonicalization of Open KBs as clustering over manuallydefined feature spaces. Manual feature engineering is expensive and often sub-optimal. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose Canonicalization using Embeddings and Side Information (CESI) – a novel approach which performs canonicalization over learned embeddings of Open KBs. CESI extends recent advances in KB embedding by incorporating relevant NP and relation phrase side information in a principled manner. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate CESI’s effectiveness.

**Dataset Culling: Towards Efficient Training Of Distillation-Based Domain Specific Models**

**Privacy Preserving Off-Policy Evaluation**

Many reinforcement learning applications involve the use of data that is sensitive, such as medical records of patients or financial information. However, most current reinforcement learning methods can leak information contained within the (possibly sensitive) data on which they are trained. To address this problem, we present the first differentially private approach for off-policy evaluation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the privacy-preserving properties of our algorithm and analyze its utility (speed of convergence). After describing some results of this theoretical analysis, we show empirically that our method outperforms previous methods (which are restricted to the on-policy setting).

**Dating Documents using Graph Convolution Networks**

Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such document internal structures. In this paper, we propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45% relative) accuracy points.

**Learning Action Representations for Reinforcement Learning**

Most model-free reinforcement learning methods leverage state representations (embeddings) for generalization, but either ignore structure in the space of actions or assume the structure is provided a priori. We show how a policy can be decomposed into a component that acts in a low-dimensional space of action representations and a component that transforms these representations into actual actions. These representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken. We provide an algorithm to both learn and use action representations and provide conditions for its convergence. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on large-scale real-world problems.

**A Simple Regularization-based Algorithm for Learning Cross-Domain Word Embeddings**

Learning word embeddings has received a significant amount of attention recently. Often, word embeddings are learned in an unsupervised manner from a large collection of text. The genre of the text typically plays an important role in the effectiveness of the resulting embeddings. How to effectively train word embedding models using data from different domains remains a problem that is underexplored. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for learning word embeddings based on text from different domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on various down-stream NLP tasks.

**Optimal Adversarial Attack on Autoregressive Models**

We investigate optimal adversarial attacks against time series forecast made by autoregressive models. In our setting, the environment evolves according to a potentially nonlinear dynamical system. A linear autoregressive model observes the current environment state and predicts its future values. But an adversary can modify the environment state and hence indirectly manipulate the autoregressive model forecasts. The adversary wants to drive the forecasts towards some adversarial targets while minimizing environment modification. We pose this attack problem as optimal control. When the environment dynamics is linear, we provide a closed-form solution to the optimal attack using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Otherwise, we propose an approximate attack based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and iterative LQR (iLQR). Our paper thus connects adversarial learning with control theory. We demonstrate the advantage of our methods empirically.

**An efficient sorting algorithm – Ultimate Heapsort(UHS)**

Motivated by the development of computer theory, the sorting algorithm is emerging in an endless stream. Inspired by decrease and conquer method, we propose a brand new sorting algorithmUltimately Heapsort. The algorithm consists of two parts: building a heap and adjusting a heap. Through the asymptotic analysis and experimental analysis of the algorithm, the time complexity of our algorithm can reach O(nlogn) under any condition. Moreover, its space complexity is only O(1). It can be seen that our algorithm is superior to all previous algorithms.

**Causal Simulations for Uplift Modeling**

Uplift modeling requires experimental data, preferably collected in random fashion. This places a logistical and financial burden upon any organisation aspiring such models. Once deployed, uplift models are subject to effects from concept drift. Hence, methods are being developed that are able to learn from newly gained experience, as well as handle drifting environments. As these new methods attempt to eliminate the need for experimental data, another approach to test such methods must be formulated. Therefore, we propose a method to simulate environments that offer causal relationships in their parameters.

**Joint Entity Linking with Deep Reinforcement Learning**

Entity linking is the task of aligning mentions to corresponding entities in a given knowledge base. Previous studies have highlighted the necessity for entity linking systems to capture the global coherence. However, there are two common weaknesses in previous global models. First, most of them calculate the pairwise scores between all candidate entities and select the most relevant group of entities as the final result. In this process, the consistency among wrong entities as well as that among right ones are involved, which may introduce noise data and increase the model complexity. Second, the cues of previously disambiguated entities, which could contribute to the disambiguation of the subsequent mentions, are usually ignored by previous models. To address these problems, we convert the global linking into a sequence decision problem and propose a reinforcement learning model which makes decisions from a global perspective. Our model makes full use of the previous referred entities and explores the long-term influence of current selection on subsequent decisions. We conduct experiments on different types of datasets, the results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art systems and has better generalization performance.

**On Steering Swarms**

The main contribution of this paper is a novel method allowing an external observer/controller to steer and guide swarms of identical and indistinguishable agents, in spite of the agents’ lack of information on absolute location and orientation. Importantly, this is done via simple global broadcast signals, based on the observed average swarm location, with no need to send control signals to any specific agent in the swarm.

**Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Distances**

The Wasserstein distance and its variations, e.g., the sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance, have recently drawn attention from the machine learning community. The SW distance, specifically, was shown to have similar properties to the Wasserstein distance, while being much simpler to compute, and is therefore used in various applications including generative modeling and general supervised/unsupervised learning. In this paper, we first clarify the mathematical connection between the SW distance and the Radon transform. We then utilize the generalized Radon transform to define a new family of distances for probability measures, which we call generalized sliced-Wasserstein (GSW) distances. We also show that, similar to the SW distance, the GSW distance can be extended to a maximum GSW (max-GSW) distance. We then provide the conditions under which GSW and max-GSW distances are indeed distances. Finally, we compare the numerical performance of the proposed distances on several generative modeling tasks, including SW flows and SW auto-encoders.

**tax2vec: Constructing Interpretable Features from Taxonomies for Short Text Classification**

The use of background knowledge remains largely unexploited in many text classification tasks. In this work, we explore word taxonomies as means for constructing new semantic features, which may improve the performance and robustness of the learned classifiers. We propose tax2vec, a parallel algorithm for constructing taxonomy based features, and demonstrate its use on six short-text classification problems, including gender, age and personality type prediction, drug effectiveness and side effect prediction, and news topic prediction. The experimental results indicate that the interpretable features constructed using tax2vec can notably improve the performance of classifiers; the constructed features, in combination with fast, linear classifiers tested against strong baselines, such as hierarchical attention neural networks, achieved comparable or better classification results on short documents. Further, tax2vec can also serve for extraction of corpus-specific keywords. Finally, we investigated the semantic space of potential features where we observe a similarity with the well known Zipf’s law.

**Crime Linkage Detection by Spatial-Temporal-Textual Point Processes**

Crimes emerge out of complex interactions of behaviors and situations; thus there are complex linkages between crime incidents. Solving the puzzle of crime linkage is a highly challenging task because we often only have limited information from indirect observations such as records, text descriptions, and associated time and locations. We propose a new modeling and learning framework for detecting linkage between crime events using \textit{spatio-temporal-textual} data, which are highly prevalent in the form of police reports. We capture the notion of \textit{modus operandi} (M.O.), by introducing a multivariate marked point process and handling the complex text jointly with the time and location. The model is able to discover the latent space that links the crime series. The model fitting is achieved by a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In addition, we explicitly reduce the bias in the text documents in our algorithm. Our numerical results using real data from the Atlanta Police show that our method has competitive performance relative to the state-of-the-art. Our results, including variable selection, are highly interpretable and may bring insights into M.O. extraction.

**Time Series Deconfounder: Estimating Treatment Effects over Time in the Presence of Hidden Confounders**

The estimation of treatment effects is a pervasive problem in medicine. Existing methods for estimating treatment effects from longitudinal observational data assume that there are no hidden confounders. This assumption is not testable in practice and, if it does not hold, leads to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop the Time Series Deconfounder, a method that leverages the assignment of multiple treatments over time to enable the estimation of treatment effects even in the presence of hidden confounders. The Time Series Deconfounder uses a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer substitute confounders that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent. Then it performs causal inference using the substitute confounders. We provide a theoretical analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying exposures using the Time Series Deconfounder. Using simulations we show the effectiveness of our method in deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses in longitudinal data.

**TF-Replicator: Distributed Machine Learning for Researchers**

**Clubmark: a Parallel Isolation Framework for Benchmarking and Profiling Clustering Algorithms on NUMA Architectures**

There is a great diversity of clustering and community detection algorithms, which are key components of many data analysis and exploration systems. To the best of our knowledge, however, there does not exist yet any uniform benchmarking framework, which is publicly available and suitable for the parallel benchmarking of diverse clustering algorithms on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets. In this paper, we introduce Clubmark, a new extensible framework that aims to fill this gap by providing a parallel isolation benchmarking platform for clustering algorithms and their evaluation on NUMA servers. Clubmark allows for fine-grained control over various execution variables (timeouts, memory consumption, CPU affinity and cache policy) and supports the evaluation of a wide range of clustering algorithms including multi-level, hierarchical and overlapping clustering techniques on both weighted and unweighted input networks with built-in evaluation of several extrinsic and intrinsic measures. Our framework is open-source and provides a consistent and systematic way to execute, evaluate and profile clustering techniques considering a number of aspects that are often missing in state-of-the-art frameworks and benchmarking systems.

**StaTIX – Statistical Type Inference on Linked Data**

Large knowledge bases typically contain data adhering to various schemas with incomplete and/or noisy type information. This seriously complicates further integration and post-processing efforts, as type information is crucial in correctly handling the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical type inference method, called StaTIX, to effectively infer instance types in Linked Data sets in a fully unsupervised manner. Our inference technique leverages a new hierarchical clustering algorithm that is robust, highly effective, and scalable. We introduce a novel approach to reduce the processing complexity of the similarity matrix specifying the relations between various instances in the knowledge base. This approach speeds up the inference process while also improving the correctness of the inferred types due to the noise attenuation in the input data. We further optimize the clustering process by introducing a dedicated hash function that speeds up the inference process by orders of magnitude without negatively affecting its accuracy. Finally, we describe a new technique to identify representative clusters from the multi-scale output of our clustering algorithm to further improve the accuracy of the inferred types. We empirically evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and compare it to the state of the art. Our results show that StaTIX is more efficient than existing methods (both in terms of speed and memory consumption) as well as more effective. StaTIX reduces the F1-score error of the predicted types by about 40% on average compared to the state of the art and improves the execution time by orders of magnitude.

**DANTE: Deep AlterNations for Training nEural networks**

We present DANTE, a novel method for training neural networks using the alternating minimization principle. DANTE provides an alternate perspective to traditional gradient-based backpropagation techniques commonly used to train deep networks. It utilizes an adaptation of quasi-convexity to cast training a neural network as a bi-quasi-convex optimization problem. We show that for neural network configurations with both differentiable (e.g. sigmoid) and non-differentiable (e.g. ReLU) activation functions, we can perform the alternations very effectively. DANTE can also be extended to networks with multiple hidden layers. In experiments on standard datasets, neural networks trained using the proposed method were found to be very promising and competitive to traditional backpropagation techniques, both in terms of quality of the solution, as well as training speed.

**The Hanabi Challenge: A New Frontier for AI Research**

From the early days of computing, games have been important testbeds for studying how well machines can do sophisticated decision making. In recent years, machine learning has made dramatic advances with artificial agents reaching superhuman performance in challenge domains like Go, Atari, and some variants of poker. As with their predecessors of chess, checkers, and backgammon, these game domains have driven research by providing sophisticated yet well-defined challenges for artificial intelligence practitioners. We continue this tradition by proposing the game of Hanabi as a new challenge domain with novel problems that arise from its combination of purely cooperative gameplay and imperfect information in a two to five player setting. In particular, we argue that Hanabi elevates reasoning about the beliefs and intentions of other agents to the foreground. We believe developing novel techniques capable of imbuing artificial agents with such theory of mind will not only be crucial for their success in Hanabi, but also in broader collaborative efforts, and especially those with human partners. To facilitate future research, we introduce the open-source Hanabi Learning Environment, propose an experimental framework for the research community to evaluate algorithmic advances, and assess the performance of current state-of-the-art techniques.
