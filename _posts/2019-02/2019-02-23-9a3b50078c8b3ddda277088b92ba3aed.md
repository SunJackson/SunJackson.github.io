*One of the maps we’ll make*

In terms of packages, we cover data-wrangling with dplyr and a little bit of tidyr. Graphics with ggplot2. Then analyses with GLMs and GAMs (mgcv package). Mapping and GIS with raster, ggplot2 and sf. We also cover how you can do spatial analyses with GAMs.

The R course was written for a 1-day workshop at University of Queensland with my colleagues, Ant Richardson, Dave Schoeman and Bill Venables (author of the MASS package among other R fundamentals).

I would guestimate that if you do this course on your own you will need a day or a bit more. It took us a whole day in class, but we skipped a lot of the bonus material.

I hope you find the course helpful and a little bit fun.
