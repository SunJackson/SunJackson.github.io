**Service Science, Management, and Engineering** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Service science, management, and engineering (SSME) is a term introduced by IBM to describe service science, an interdisciplinary approach to the study, design, and implementation of service systems – complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others. More precisely, SSME has been defined as the application of science, management, and engineering disciplines to tasks that one organization beneficially performs for and with another.Today, SSME is a call for academia, industry, and governments to focus on becoming more systematic about innovation in the service sector, which is the largest sector of the economy in most industrialized nations, and is fast becoming the largest sector in developing nations as well. SSME is also a proposed academic discipline and research area that would complement – rather than replace – the many disciplines that contribute to knowledge about service. The interdisciplinary nature of the field calls for a curriculum and competencies to advance the development and contribution of the field of SSME. … 

**CausalSpartanX** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Causal consistency is an intermediate consistency model that can be achieved together with high availability and performance requirements even in presence of network partitions. In the context of partitioned data stores, it has been shown that implicit dependency tracking using timestamps is more efficient than explicit dependency tracking. Existing time-based solutions depend on monotonic psychical clocks that are closely synchronized. These requirements make current protocols vulnerable to clock anomalies. In this paper, we propose a new time-based algorithm, CausalSpartanX, that instead of physical clocks, utilizes Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs). We show that using HLCs, without any overhead, we make the system robust on physical clock anomalies. This improvement is more significant in the context of query amplification, where a single query results in multiple GET/PUT operations. We also show that CausalSpartanX decreases the visibility latency for a given data item compared with existing time-based approaches. In turn, this reduces the completion time of collaborative applications where two clients accessing two different replicas edit same items of the data store. CausalSpartanX also provides causally consistent distributed read-only transactions. CausalSpartanX read-only transactions are non-blocking and require only one round of communication between the client and the servers. Also, the slowdowns of partitions that are unrelated to a transaction do not affect the performance of the transaction. Like previous protocols, CausalSpartanX assumes that a given client does not access more than one replica. We show that in presence of network partitions, this assumption (made in several other works) is essential if one were to provide causal consistency as well as immediate availability to local updates. … 

**Repulsion Loss** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Detecting individual pedestrians in a crowd remains a challenging problem since the pedestrians often gather together and occlude each other in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first explore how a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector is harmed by crowd occlusion via experimentation, providing insights into the crowd occlusion problem. Then, we propose a novel bounding box regression loss specifically designed for crowd scenes, termed repulsion loss. This loss is driven by two motivations: the attraction by target, and the repulsion by other surrounding objects. The repulsion term prevents the proposal from shifting to surrounding objects thus leading to more crowd-robust localization. Our detector trained by repulsion loss outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods with a significant improvement in occlusion cases. …
