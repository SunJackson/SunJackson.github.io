**Dynamic Capacity Network (DCN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We introduce the Dynamic Capacity Network (DCN), a neural network that can adaptively assign its capacity across different portions of the input data. This is achieved by combining modules of two types: low-capacity sub-networks and high-capacity sub-networks. The low-capacity sub-networks are applied across most of the input, but also provide a guide to select a few portions of the input on which to apply the high-capacity sub-networks. The selection is made using a novel gradient-based attention mechanism, that efficiently identifies the modules and input features that are most likely to impact the DCN’s output and to which we’d like to devote more capacity. We focus our empirical evaluation on the cluttered MNIST and SVHN image datasets. Our findings indicate that DCNs are able to drastically reduce the number of computations, compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while maintaining similar performance. … 

**Robust Options Policy Iteration** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Robust reinforcement learning aims to produce policies that have strong guarantees even in the face of environments/transition models whose parameters have strong uncertainty. Existing work uses value-based methods and the usual primitive action setting. In this paper, we propose robust methods for learning temporally abstract actions, in the framework of options. We present a Robust Options Policy Iteration (ROPI) algorithm with convergence guarantees, which learns options that are robust to model uncertainty. We utilize ROPI to learn robust options with the Robust Options Deep Q Network (RO-DQN) that solves multiple tasks and mitigates model misspecification due to model uncertainty. We present experimental results which suggest that policy iteration with linear features may have an inherent form of robustness when using coarse feature representations. In addition, we present experimental results which demonstrate that robustness helps policy iteration implemented on top of deep neural networks to generalize over a much broader range of dynamics than non-robust policy iteration. … 

**Privacy-Adversarial Framework** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Latent factor models for recommender systems represent users and items as low dimensional vectors. Privacy risks have been previously studied mostly in the context of recovery of personal information in the form of usage records from the training data. However, the user representations themselves may be used together with external data to recover private user information such as gender and age. In this paper we show that user vectors calculated by a common recommender system can be exploited in this way. We propose the privacy-adversarial framework to eliminate such leakage, and study the trade-off between recommender performance and leakage both theoretically and empirically using a benchmark dataset. We briefly discuss further applications of this method towards the generation of deeper and more insightful recommendations. …
