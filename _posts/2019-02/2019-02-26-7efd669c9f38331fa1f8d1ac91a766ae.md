Introduction
`stats19` is a new R package enabling access to and working withGreat Britainâ€™s official road traffic casualty database,STATS19.

We started the package in late 2018 following three main motivations:

1. The release of the 2017 road crash statistics, which showedworsening road safety in some areas, increasing the importance ofmaking the data more accessible.

1. The realisation that many researchers were writing ad hoc code toclean the data, with a huge amount of duplicated (wasted) effort andpotential for mistakes to lead to errors in the labelling of thedata (more on that below).

1. An understanding of the concept of â€˜modularityâ€™ in software design,following the Unixphilosophy thatprograms should â€˜do one thing and do it wellâ€™. This realisation hasled to code inside the rOpenSci-hosted package`stplanr` being split-outinto two separate packages:`cyclestreets` and`stats19`.


We have a wider motivation: we want the roads to be safer. By makingdata on the nature of road crashes more publicly accessible to inform policy,we hope this package saves lives.

`stats19` been tested and peer reviewed thanks to rOpenSci and is now published in theJournal of Open Source Software, making this an ideal time to present the package to the world ğŸš€.For installation and the code, see its home in rOpenSci:https://github.com/ropensci/stats19, and the package documentation athttps://itsleeds.github.io/stats19/.

In this post, weâ€™ll provide a bit of context, show how the package works, and provide ideas for future work building on the experience. Version `0.2.0` has just been released on CRAN.

#### Related work

Robin Lovelace (package maintainer) has written code (robinlovelace/bikeR) for an academic paper on cycle safety in Yorkshire based on STATS19 data. Malcolm Morgan (one of the package authors) has written code to process different STATS19 data for the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (see cyipt/stats19).

The large and complex STATS19 data from the UKâ€™s Department for Transport, which is open access but difficult-to-use, represented a perfect opportunity for us to get stuck into a chunky data processing challenge.

#### What is STATS19?

The name comes from a UK police form calledSTATS19(note the capital letters). Another document called STATS20 is the guidance for officers filling in a STATS19 form. The Department for Transport (DfT) also names the dataset STATS19 on the main web page that links to open access road crashdata.

One of the reviewer comments from the rOpenSci review process (whichhas 77 comments â€“ lots of knowledgeshared) alludedto the packageâ€™s esoteric name:

> 
I confess I wish the package name was more expressiveâ€“stats19 sounds like an introductory statistics class.


We agree! However, the priority with the package is to remain faithful to the data, and alternative name options, such as stats19data, roadcrashesUK and roadSafetyData were not popular. Furthermore, the term â€˜stats19â€™ is strongly associated with road crash data. On Wikipedia, the URLhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATS19 resolves tohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain.

An important point is that the dataset omits crashes in whichnobody was hurt, as emphasised by another governmentdocument.

The importance of road safety and informed decision making based oncrash data cannot be overstated. Deliberately avoiding the matter oflife and death of road safety, two numbers from a strategydocumentby the UK government (2011) are worth mentioning to show the scale ofthe numbers:

> 
The economic welfare costs [of road collisions] are estimated ataround Â£16 billion a year while insurance payouts for motoring claimsalone are now over Â£12 billion a year.


Even more shocking are the globalstatistics, assummarised by an open access and reproducible paper submitted for publication, which usesdata from the package to explore car-pedestriancrashes:

> 
While so many people die on the roads each year in the UK (1,793people in 2017, 3 deaths per 100,000) and worldwide (1,250,000 peoplein 2015, 17 deaths per 100,000) and â€˜vision zeroâ€™ remains a Swedishdream, we urge people researching STATS19 and otherroad safety datasets to focus on a more urgent question: how to stopthis carnage?


#### The road crash data in stats19

There are three main different types of CSV files released by the DfT:`accidents`, `vehicles` and `casualties` tables. There is a schemacovering these tables but a good amount of work is needed to understandit, let alone be able to process the data contained within the files and convertthe integers they contain into meaningful data.

There are separate files for each of the above tables for certain years (e.g. 2016, 2017) but not for all of 1979 â€“ 2017 or 2018 now. The largest chunk is the 1979 â€“ 2004 data, which is made available in a huge ZIP file (link). Unzipped this contains the following 3 files, which occupy almost 2 GB on your hard drive:

```
721M Apr 3 2013 Accidents7904.csv
344M Apr 3 2013 Casualty7904.csv
688M Apr 3 2013 Vehicles7904.csv
# total 1.753 GB data

```

#### How stats19 works

With those introductions out of the way, lets see how the packageworks and how to access STATS19 data, back to 1979. Firstinstall the package in the usual way:

```
# release version - currently 0.2.0
install.packages("stats19") 
# dev version
# remotes::install_github("ropensci/stats19") 

```

Attach the package as follows:

```
library(stats19)

```

The easiest way to get STATS19 data is with `get_stats19()`. Thisfunction takes two main arguments, `year` and `type`. The year can be anyyear between 1979 and 2017.

```
crashes_2017 = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "Accidents", ask = FALSE)
nrow(crashes_2017)

```

```
## [1] 129982

```

What just happened? We just downloaded, cleaned and read-in data on allroad crashes recorded by the police in 2017 across Great Britain. We canexplore the `crashes_2017` object a little more:

```
column_names = names(crashes_2017)
length(column_names)

```

```
## [1] 32

```

```
head(column_names)

```

```
## [1] "accident_index" "location_easting_osgr" 
## [3] "location_northing_osgr" "longitude" 
## [5] "latitude" "police_force"

```

```
class(crashes_2017)

```

```
## [1] "spec_tbl_df" "tbl_df" "tbl" "data.frame"

```

```
kableExtra::kable(head(crashes_2017[, c(1, 4, 5, 7, 10)]))

```

The package contains the names of all â€œzipâ€� files released by the DfTand hosted on Amazon servers to download. These file names have beenincluded in the package and can be found under `file_names` variablename. for example:

```
stats19::file_names$dftRoadSafetyData_Vehicles_2017.zip

```

```
## [1] "dftRoadSafetyData_Vehicles_2017.zip"

```

You can also get the raw data (if you really want!) to see how muchmore useful the data is after it has been cleaned and labelled by the`stats19` package, compared with the data provided bygovernment:

```
crashes_2017_raw = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "Accidents", ask = FALSE, format = FALSE)

```

```
## Files identified: dftRoadSafetyData_Accidents_2017.zip

## http://data.dft.gov.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/road-accidents-safety-data/dftRoadSafetyData_Accidents_2017.zip

## Data already exists in data_dir, not downloading

## Data saved at /tmp/RtmpYh76XA/dftRoadSafetyData_Accidents_2017/Acc.csv

## Reading in:

## /tmp/RtmpYh76XA/dftRoadSafetyData_Accidents_2017/Acc.csv

```

```
kableExtra::kable(head(crashes_2017_raw[, c(1, 4, 5, 7, 10)]))

```

The first two columns are raw read, the next two are formatted by`stats19`package:

```
kableExtra::kable(cbind(
 head(crashes_2017_raw[1:2, c(7, 10)]),
 head(crashes_2017[1:2, c(7, 10)])
 ))

```

Note: the severity type is not labelled (this problem affects dozens ofcolumns), the column names are inconsistent, and the dates have notbeen cleaned and converted into a user-friendly date (`POSIXct`) class.

#### Creating geographic crash data

An important feature of STATS19 data is that the â€œaccidentsâ€� tablecontains geographic coordinates. These are provided at ~10m resolutionin the UKâ€™s official coordinate reference system (the Ordnance SurveyNational Grid, EPSG code 27700). `stats19` converts the non-geographictables created by `format_accidents()` into the geographic data form ofthe `sf` package with thefunction `format_sf()` asfollows:

```
crashes_sf = format_sf(crashes_2017)

```

```
## 19 rows removed with no coordinates

```

```
# crashes_sf = format_sf(crashes_2017, lonlat = TRUE) # provides the data in lon/lat format

```

An example of an administrative zone dataset of relevance to STATS19data is the boundaries of police forces in England, which is provided inthe packaged dataset `police_boundaries`. The following code chunkdemonstrates the kind of spatial operations that can be performed ongeographic STATS19 data, by counting and plotting the number offatalities per police force:

```
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
crashes_sf %>% 
 filter(accident_severity == "Fatal") %>% 
 select(n_fatalities = accident_index) %>% 
 aggregate(by = police_boundaries, FUN = length) %>% 
 plot()

```

```
# as Layik and Robin are based in West Yorkshire
west_yorkshire =
 police_boundaries[police_boundaries$pfa16nm == "West Yorkshire", ]

```

```
crashes_wy = crashes_sf[west_yorkshire, ]
nrow(crashes_wy) # which is 3.36%

```

```
## [1] 4371

```

#### The big picture: road safety

We can combine the three sets of tables (accidents, vehicles and casualties) to analyse the data further.Lets read the datasets first:

```
#crashes_2017 = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "Accidents", ask = FALSE)
casualties_2017 = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "Casualties", ask = FALSE)
nrow(casualties_2017)

```

```
## [1] 170993

```

```
vehicles_2017 = get_stats19(year = 2017, type = "Vehicles", ask = FALSE)
nrow(vehicles_2017)

```

```
## [1] 238926

```

Lets now read in casualties that took place in West Yorkshire as the authors are based in West Yorkshire (using`crashes_wy` object above), and count the number of casualties byseverity for each crash:

```
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
sel = casualties_2017$accident_index %in% crashes_wy$accident_index
casualties_wy = casualties_2017[sel, ]
cas_types = casualties_wy %>% 
 select(accident_index, casualty_type) %>% 
 group_by(accident_index) %>% 
 summarise(
 Total = n(),
 walking = sum(casualty_type == "Pedestrian"),
 cycling = sum(casualty_type == "Cyclist"),
 passenger = sum(casualty_type == "Car occupant")
 ) 
cj = left_join(crashes_wy, cas_types)

```

What just happened?

We found the subset of casualties that took place in West Yorkshire withreference to the `accident_index` variable in the `accidents` table.Then we used the `dplyr` function `summarise()`, to find the number ofpeople who were in a car, cycling, and walking when they were injured.This new casualty dataset is joined onto the `crashes_wy` dataset. Theresult is a spatial (`sf`) data frame of crashes in West Yorkshire, withcolumns counting how many road users of different types were hurt. Thejoined data has additional variables:

```
base::setdiff(names(cj), names(crashes_wy))

```

```
## [1] "Total" "walking" "cycling" "passenger"

```

In addition to the `Total` number of people hurt/killed, `cj` contains acolumn for each type of casualty (cyclist, car occupant, etc.), and anumber corresponding to the number of each type hurt in each crash. Italso contains the `geometry` column from `crashes_sf`. In other words,joins allow the casualties and vehicles tables to be geo-referenced. Wecan then explore the spatial distribution of different casualty types.The following figure, for example, shows the spatial distribution ofpedestrians and car passengers hurt in car crashes across West Yorkshirein 2017:

```
library(ggplot2)
crashes_types = cj %>% 
 filter(accident_severity != "Slight") %>% 
 mutate(type = case_when(
 walking > 0 ~ "Walking",
 cycling > 0 ~ "Cycling",
 passenger > 0 ~ "Passenger",
 TRUE ~ "Other"
 ))
ggplot(crashes_types, aes(size = Total, colour = speed_limit)) +
 geom_sf(show.legend = "point", alpha = 0.3) +
 facet_grid(vars(type), vars(accident_severity)) +
 scale_size(
 breaks = c(1:3, 12),
 labels = c(1:2, "3+", 12)
 ) +
 scale_color_gradientn(colours = c("blue", "yellow", "red")) +
 theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())

```
