**Argument Harvesting** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Much research in computational argumentation assumes that arguments and counterarguments can be obtained in some way. Yet, to improve and apply models of argument, we need methods for acquiring them. Current approaches include argument mining from text, hand coding of arguments by researchers, or generating arguments from knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call argument harvesting, that uses a chatbot to enter into a dialogue with a participant to get arguments and counterarguments from him or her. Because it is automated, the chatbot can be used repeatedly in many dialogues, and thereby it can generate a large corpus. We describe the architecture of the chatbot, provide methods for managing a corpus of arguments and counterarguments, and an evaluation of our approach in a case study concerning attitudes of women to participation in sport. … 

**Bounded-Abstention Method With two Constraints of Reject Rates (BA2)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Abstaining classificaiton aims to reject to classify the easily misclassified examples, so it is an effective approach to increase the clasificaiton reliability and reduce the misclassification risk in the cost-sensitive applications. In such applications, different types of errors (false positive or false negative) usaully have unequal costs. And the error costs, which depend on specific applications, are usually unknown. However, current abstaining classification methods either do not distinguish the error types, or they need the cost information of misclassification and rejection, which are realized in the framework of cost-sensitive learning. In this paper, we propose a bounded-abstention method with two constraints of reject rates (BA2), which performs abstaining classification when error costs are unequal and unknown. BA2 aims to obtain the optimal area under the ROC curve (AUC) by constraining the reject rates of the positive and negative classes respectively. Specifically, we construct the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and stepwise search the optimal reject thresholds from both ends of the curve, untill the two constraints are satisfied. Experimental results show that BA2 obtains higher AUC and lower total cost than the state-of-the-art abstaining classification methods. Meanwhile, BA2 achieves controllable reject rates of the positive and negative classes. … 

**Lifted Neural Network** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We describe a novel family of models of multi- layer feedforward neural networks in which the activation functions are encoded via penalties in the training problem. Our approach is based on representing a non-decreasing activation function as the argmin of an appropriate convex optimization problem. The new framework allows for algorithms such as block-coordinate descent methods to be applied, in which each step is composed of a simple (no hidden layer) supervised learning problem that is parallelizable across data points and/or layers. Experiments indicate that the proposed models provide excellent initial guesses for weights for standard neural networks. In addition, the model provides avenues for interesting extensions, such as robustness against noisy inputs and optimizing over parameters in activation functions. …
