The hclwizard.org web page has been relaunched, hosting three online color apps based on the HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) color model: a palette constructor, a color vision deficiency emulator, and a color picker.

## HCL wizard: Somewhere over the rainbow

The web page http://hclwizard.org/ had originally been started to accompany the manuscript: “Somewhere over the Rainbow: How to Make Effective Use of Colors in Meteorological Visualizations” by Stauffer *et al.* (2015, *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*) to facilitate the adoption of color palettes using the HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) color model. It was realized using the R package colorspace in combination with shiny.

After the major update of the colorspace package the http://hclwizard.org/ has also just been relaunched, now hosting all three shiny color apps from the package:

## Palette creator

This app allows to design new palettes interactively: qualitative palettes, sequential palettes with single or multiple hues, and diverging palettes (composed from two single-hue sequential palettes). The underlying HCL coordinates can be modified, starting out from a wide range of pre-defined palettes. The resulting palette can be assessed in various kinds of displays and exported in different formats.

## Color vision deficiency emulator

This app allows to assess how well the colors in an uploaded graphics file (png/jpg/jpeg) work for viewers with color vision deficiencies. Different kinds of color blindness can be emulated: deuteranope (red deficient), protanope (green deficient), tritanope (blue deficient), monochrome (grayscale).

## Color picker

In addition to the palette creator app described above, this app provides a more traditional color picker. Sets of individual colors can be selected (and exported) by navigating different views of the HCL color space.
