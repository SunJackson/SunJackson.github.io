POCs often feel like a gamble. You're testing the boundaries of your business's technological capacity and your ability to change at the same time. If your POC is an anomaly or you're unprepared to activate it, you risk missing out on technology that could keep your business on top. The choice for a data specific POC is critical, because organizational resistance to change is one of the biggest barriers to data integration. So if your POC fails, users are unlikely to adapt to support later data initiatives.

But the choice of which POC is best for the organization and can bring the most value is agonizing.
