The newly available chapters cover:

**Data Engineering And Data Shaping** – Explores how to use R to organize or wrangle data into a shape useful for analysis. The chapter covers applying data transforms, data manipulation packages, and more.

**Choosing and Evaluating Models** – The chapter starts with exploring machine learning approaches and then moves to studying key model evaluation topics like mapping business problems to machine learning tasks, evaluating model quality, and how to explain model predictions.

If you haven’t signed up for our book’s MEAP (Manning Early Access Program), we encourage you to do so. The MEAP includes a free copy of *Practical Data Science with R*, First Edition, as well as early access to chapter drafts of the second edition as we complete them.

For those of you who have already subscribed — thank you! We hope you enjoy the new chapters, and we look forward to your feedback.
