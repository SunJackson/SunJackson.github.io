### Why Python?

 Python is a popular high-level object-oriented programming language which is used widely by the huge number of software developers. Guido van Rossum designed this in 1991, and Python software foundation has developed this. But the question is there were already dozens of programming language available based on OOP concepts then why this new one? So, the main purpose to develop this language is to emphasize on code readability and science and mathematical computing (NumPy, SymPy, Orange).

Python’s syntax is very clean and short in length. Python is open-source and portable language which supports a large standard library.

### What is Data Science?

You must heard about this but what do you understand by this term? Who can be a data scientist?

Data science is a collection of various tools, data interface and algorithms with machine learning principles to discover the hidden patterns from the raw data. The raw data is stored in enterprise data warehouses and used in creative ways by using Data Science to generate business value from it.

Use of Data Science can be understand by this below infographic.

A Data Analyst and Data Scientist are both the different as data analyst work on to only process the data history and explains what is going on, whereas Data Scientist needs various advanced algorithms of machine learning to identify the occurrence for a particular event by using the concept of analysis to discover the all about the data.

 

### Introduction to Python Data Science

 **There are various programming languages that can be used for Data Science i.e. SQL, Java, Matlab, Sas, R and many more but Python** is the most preferred choice by data scientists among all the other programming languages in this list.

Python has some extra ordinary features because of them it is preferred mostly. These are the listed features:

Python is very strong and simple so that easy to learn language. You don’t need to worry about its syntax if you are beginner even.
Python supports many platforms like windows, Mac, Linux etc.
Python is high level programming language so that you just need to write program in simple English and this will internally convert the code into low level code.
Python is interpreted language that means to it runs code one instruction at a time.
Python can perform data visualization, data analysis and data manipulation. NumPy and Pandas are used for manipulation.
Python serves various powerful libraries for machine learning and scientific computations. Various complex scientific calculations and machine learning algorithms can be performed using this language easily in some simple syntaxes and get the output according to the data.

These are several reasons that why developers prefer Python over the other programming languages. Now there are other terms introduced which we need to clarify in detail. Move on to that start with Data Manipulation.

Data Manipulation is used to extract, filter and transform the data in quick and easily with the efficient result. There are two important libraries that are used to perform these tasks which is NumPy and Pandas.

**NumPy** is an open source library available in Python for free and stands for Numerical Python. It is the popular core library of Python which is useful in scientific calculations which provide array objects and also provides tools to integrate C and C++ as well. NumPy is an powerful N dimensional array which is in the form of rows and columns. You can initialize this from the Pythons list and access it. To use this, first you just need to install this library using the command prompt by typing: conda install numpy. After that you can go to simply in your IDE and type import numpy to use it.

**Example**: Create a NumPy one dimensional Array

First you need to import NumPy library. For that write



Create an array



**Output**

`array( [1,2,3] )`

Similarly, **Pandas** is powerful library which is known for its ability to create Data Frames in Python and used for Data Manipulation and Data Analysis. Pandas is suitable for various data such as matrices, statistical, observational etc. To install Pandas you have to follow the same steps as NumPy, install this library from the command prompt by typing: conda install pandas. After that you can go to simply in your IDE and type import pandas to use it.

**Example**: Create a Pandas operation

First you need to import Pandas library. For that write as:



Create 2 lists 



**Output:**



Here in the output, 0, 1, 2 is the index. If you want to show the index value according to your reference, you can do as following:

### How to Choose Best Python Data Science Framework?

 Python has many frameworks for data analysis, data manipulation or data visualization. Python programming is an ideal choice for data science, for evaluating large datasets, for data visualization etc.

Data analysis and Python programming are complementary to each other. Python is incredible language for data science and those who want to start in the field of data science. It supports a huge number of array libraries and frameworks to give a choice for working with Data Science in an clean and efficient way. The various frameworks and libraries comes with the specific purpose for use. You need to choose according to your requirement. Here we have listed some of the Best Python frameworks used for Data Science.

**NumPy:** As we have summarised before NumPy is the short form of ‘Numerical Python’. It is the most popular and base for higher level tools in Python programming for data science. In-depth understanding of NumPy array helps to use the Pandas effectively for Data Scientists. NumPy is versatile to work with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. NumPy has so many built-in functions related to statistics and numeric including linear algebra, Fourier transform, etc. NumPy is the standard library for scientific computing with powerful tools to integrate with C and C++ codes. If you want to master data science then NumPy is the must learn library.

**SciPy:** It is a open source library used for computing various modules such as image processing, integration, interpolation, special functions, optimizations, linear algebra, Fourier Transform (FFT), clustering and so many other tasks. This library is used with NumPy to perform efficient numerical computing. SciPy is also used for image processing and signal processing.

**SciKit:** This popular library is used for machine learning in data science with various classification, regression and clustering algorithms provide the support for vector machines, naïve Bayes, gradient boosting, and logical regression. SciKit is designed to interoperate with SciPy and NumPy.

**Pandas:** Pandas are popularly known for Data Framing in Python. This is a best and powerful library for Data analysis rather than the other domain-specific language like R. By using Pandas it’s easier to handle missing data, supports working with differently indexed data gathered from multiple different resources, supports automatic data alignment. It also provides tools for data analysis and data structure like merging, shaping or slicing datasets and also it is very effective in working with data related to Time series by providing robust tools for loading data from Excel, Flat-Files, databases and fast HDF5 format.

**Matplotlib:** Matplotlib in Python stands for Mathematical Plotting Library in Python. This is a library which is mostly used for data visualization by plotting 3D plot, histograms, image plot, scatterplot, bar charts, power spectra with interactive features for zooming and panning quality for publication in different hard copy formats. It supports almost all platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. This library also serves as an extension for the NumPy library. The Matplotlib has a module pyplot which is used in visualizations is often compared to MATLAB.

These libraries are the best for beginners to start Data Science with the Python programming language. Other than these libraries there are many other Python libraries available such as NLTK for natural language processing, Pattern for web mining, Theano for deep learning, IPython, Scrappy for web scraping, Mlpy, Statsmodels, and more. But for the beginners starting with data science in Python must be well-versed with the top listed data analysis libraries in Python.

We hope this article helped you to choose the best data science framework or library. If you still have any query or need any guidance or support you can contact us.
