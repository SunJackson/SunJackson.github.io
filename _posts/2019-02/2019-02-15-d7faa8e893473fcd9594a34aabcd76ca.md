Iâ€™ve got a post up over at $DAYJOBâ€™s blog on using the `ropendata`ðŸ”— package to access the ginormous and ever-increasing amount of internet telemetry (scan) data via the Rapid7 Open Data API.

Itâ€™s super-R-code-heavy but renders surprisingly well in Ghost (the blogging platform we use at work) and covers everything from where to sign up for an account, installing the package (itâ€™s on CRAN!), enriching scan data with free geolocation databases and `rgeolocate` plus even shows how to cobble together some fairly intricate R + Rcpp code so you can decode gnarly, binary UDP responses from esoteric protocol exchanges.

Give it a look, grab the companion Rmd and drop any comments there or here if you have any questions, or reach out to [email protected].
