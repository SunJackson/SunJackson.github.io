For some code, such as benchmarking, fixing the code such that the output does not change is very difficult in principle, therefore we must find a workaround that would ensure the results stay untouched. One approach is to run the code once, store the results and do not run the code again on render. Some ways to do that:


Using the cache=TRUE chunk option


In practice, this can be done nicely by using the `cache=TRUE` option, which provides this behavior and also makes sure that the cache is updated automatically when the code chunk changes, so the correctness of results is ensured. Exceptions to this exist for some special cases, read the details in the knitr manual for a deeper understanding. Here is an example chunk using that option:

	```{r cache=TRUE}
	system.time(runif(1e6))
	```

Storing a needed representation of the object directly in the Rmd


One property of knitrâ€™s caching that could be considered a downside is that the cache storage uses binary files, which while being a completely natural choice is not the best for version control. Especially when this is a concern and the code chunk outputs are small in size, other options may also be considered.

One such example would be to save a needed representation of the result directly in the Rmd and use `eval=FALSE` on the code chunk. This comes with trade-offs too, notably we must pay attention for the chunk changes, as there would be no automated update similar to the one provided by knitrâ€™s cache mechanism.

As an example, we could rewrite the chunk above into two chunks like so â€“ the first chunk shows the code in the output without running, the second makes sure that the results that we store gets shown (but the code does not):

	```{r eval=FALSE}
	system.time(runif(1e6))
	```
	
	```{r echo=FALSE}
	# This is pre-calculated and just shown to keep the output static
	
	structure(
	  c(0.081, 0.003, 0.084, 0, 0)
	  class = "proc_time"
	  .Names = c("user.self", "sys.self", "elapsed", "user.child", "sys.child")
	)
	```
The content of the second chunk can be obtained by using `dput(system.time(runif(1e6)))`. Naturally, this may become quite impractical to use with bigger objects.


Storing the rendered output directly in the Rmd


Another variation of the above would be to not even bother with obtaining the representation of the output via evaluating a code chunk, but just placing the rendered output itself into the Rmd directly. This comes with the same downsides as the previous approach with some extras. Mainly, we need to create a format-specific output, meaning this approach can be considered only if the output format is fixed and will not change.

For example, we can be reasonably sure that for a blogdown website the output will be HTML. In case we are ok with all those trade-offs, we can place the following into our .Rmd to represent the above code chunks in HTML:

```

## user system elapsed 
## 0.081 0.003 0.084

```
