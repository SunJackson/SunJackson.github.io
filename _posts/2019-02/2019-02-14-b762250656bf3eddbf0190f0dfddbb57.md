The Process is a weekly newsletter where I evaluate how visualization tools, rules, and guidelines work in practice. I publish 1,500+ words every Thursday. Get it in your inbox or access it via the site.


You also gain unlimited access to hundreds of hours worth of step-by-step visualization courses and tutorials, which will help you make sense of data for insight and presentation. Source code and datasets are included so that you can more easily apply what you learn in your own work.



FlowingData is a never-ending source of information, inspiration and instruction in data, visualization and design and Nathan Yau’s approach to exploring these subjects is both technical and familiar, somewhat similar to a discussion of a shared obsession over beers with a friend.

The tutorials are very helpful to move from "Oooo, cool!" to how to actually DO the cool.
