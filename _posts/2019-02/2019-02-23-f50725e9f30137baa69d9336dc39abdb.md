**Interest-Related Item Similarity Model Based on Multimodal Data for Top-N Recommendation**

Nowadays, the recommendation systems are applied in the fields of e-commerce, video websites, social networking sites, etc., which bring great convenience to people’s daily lives. The types of the information are diversified and abundant in recommendation systems, therefore the proportion of unstructured multimodal data like text, image and video is increasing. However, due to the representation gap between different modalities, it is intractable to effectively use unstructured multimodal data to improve the efficiency of recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Multimodal Interest-Related Item Similarity model (Multimodal IRIS) to provide recommendations based on multimodal data source. Specifically, the Multimodal IRIS model consists of three modules, i.e., multimodal feature learning module, the Interest-Related Network (IRN) module and item similarity recommendation module. The multimodal feature learning module adds knowledge sharing unit among different modalities. Then IRN learn the interest relevance between target item and different historical items respectively. At last, the multimodal data feature learning, IRN and item similarity recommendation modules are unified into an integrated system to achieve performance enhancements and to accommodate the addition or absence of different modal data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, by dealing with the multimodal data which people may pay more attention to when selecting items, the proposed Multimodal IRIS significantly improves accuracy and interpretability on top-N recommendation task over the state-of-the-art methods.

**Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Long-term User Engagement in Recommender Systems**

Recommender systems play a crucial role in our daily lives. Feed streaming mechanism has been widely used in the recommender system, especially on the mobile Apps. The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such an interactive manner, a good recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far beyond classical instant metrics, and typically measured by {\bf long-term user engagement}. Directly optimizing the long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning~(RL) naturally fits the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are versatile and difficult to model, which typically consists of both instant feedback~(\eg clicks, ordering) and delayed feedback~(\eg dwell time, revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation. To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework — FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement. FeedRec includes two components: 1)~a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical LSTM takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2)~an S-Network, which simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world large scale data show that FeedRec effectively optimizes the long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts.

**Machine Learning on Biomedical Images: Interactive Learning, Transfer Learning, Class Imbalance, and Beyond**

In this paper, we highlight three issues that limit performance of machine learning on biomedical images, and tackle them through 3 case studies: 1) Interactive Machine Learning (IML): we show how IML can drastically improve exploration time and quality of direct volume rendering. 2) transfer learning: we show how transfer learning along with intelligent pre-processing can result in better Alzheimer’s diagnosis using a much smaller training set 3) data imbalance: we show how our novel focal Tversky loss function can provide better segmentation results taking into account the imbalanced nature of segmentation datasets. The case studies are accompanied by in-depth analytical discussion of results with possible future directions.

**Off-Policy Actor-Critic in an Ensemble: Achieving Maximum General Entropy and Effective Environment Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning**

We propose a new policy iteration theory as an important extension of soft policy iteration and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the most efficient model free algorithms for deep reinforcement learning. Supported by the new theory, arbitrary entropy measures that generalize Shannon entropy, such as Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy, can be utilized to properly randomize action selection while fulfilling the goal of maximizing expected long-term rewards. Our theory gives birth to two new algorithms, i.e., Tsallis entropy Actor-Critic (TAC) and Renyi entropy Actor-Critic (RAC). Theoretical analysis shows that these algorithms can be more effective than SAC. Moreover, they pave the way for us to develop a new Ensemble Actor-Critic (EAC) algorithm in this paper that features the use of a bootstrap mechanism for deep environment exploration as well as a new value-function based mechanism for high-level action selection. Empirically we show that TAC, RAC and EAC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark control tasks, outperforming SAC and several cutting-edge learning algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and effectiveness.

**Fully Convolutional Networks for Text Classification**

In this work I propose a new way of using fully convolutional networks for classification while allowing for input of any size. I additionally propose two modifications on the idea of attention and the benefits and detriments of using the modifications. Finally, I show suboptimal results on the ITAmoji 2018 tweet to emoji task and provide a discussion about why that might be the case as well as a proposed fix to further improve results.

**CrossNorm: Normalization for Off-Policy TD Reinforcement Learning**

Off-policy Temporal Difference (TD) learning methods, when combined with function approximators, suffer from the risk of divergence, a phenomenon known as the deadly triad. It has long been noted that some feature representations work better than others. In this paper we investigate how feature normalization can prevent divergence and improve training. Our method, which we call CrossNorm, can be regarded as a new variant of batch normalization that re-centers data for multi-modal distributions, which occur in the off-policy TD updates. We show empirically that CrossNorm improves the stability of the learning process. We apply CrossNorm to DDPG and TD3 and achieve stable training and improved performance across a range of MuJoCo benchmark tasks. Moreover, for the first time, we are able to train DDPG stably without the use of target networks.

**A New Interaction Index inspired by the Taylor Series**

We study interactions among players in cooperative games. We propose a new interaction index called Shapley-Taylor interaction index. It decomposes the value of the game into terms that model the interactions between subsets of players, analogous to how the Taylor series represents a function in terms of its derivatives of various orders. We axiomatize the method using the standard Shapley axioms–linearity, dummy, symmetry and efficiency–and also an additional axiom that we call the interaction distribution axiom. This new axiom explicitly characterizes how inter-actions are distributed for a class of games called interaction games. We contrast the Shapley-Taylor interaction index against the previously pro-posed Shapley Interaction index and the Banzhaf interaction index (cf. [2]).

**Quick and Easy Time Series Generation with Established Image-based GANs**

In the recent years Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress in generating authentic looking data. In this work we introduce our simple method to exploit the advancements in well established image-based GANs to synthesise single channel time series data. We implement Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) with gradient penalty due to their stability in training to synthesise three different types of data; sinusoidal data, photoplethysmograph (PPG) data and electrocardiograph (ECG) data. The length of the returned time series data is limited only by the image resolution, we use an image size of 64×64 pixels which yields 4096 data points. We present both visual and quantitative evidence that our novel method can successfully generate time series data using image-based GANs.

**WaveletFCNN: A Deep Time Series Classification Model for Wind Turbine Blade Icing Detection**

Wind power, as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, is plentiful and renewable. Data-driven approaches are increasingly popular for inspecting the wind turbine failures. In this paper, we propose a novel classification-based anomaly detection system for icing detection of the wind turbine blades. We effectively combine the deep neural networks and wavelet transformation to identify such failures sequentially across the time. In the training phase, we present a wavelet based fully convolutional neural network (FCNN), namely WaveletFCNN, for the time series classification. We improve the original (FCNN) by augmenting features with the wavelet coefficients. WaveletFCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art FCNN for the univariate time series classification on the UCR time series archive benchmarks. In the detecting phase, we combine the sliding window and majority vote algorithms to provide the timely monitoring of the anomalies. The system has been successfully implemented on a real-world dataset from Goldwind Inc, where the classifier is trained on a multivariate time series dataset and the monitoring algorithm is implemented to capture the abnormal condition on signals from a wind farm.

**Classification with unknown class conditional label noise on non-compact feature spaces**

We investigate the problem of classification in the presence of unknown class conditional label noise in which the labels observed by the learner have been corrupted with some unknown class dependent probability. In order to obtain finite sample rates, previous approaches to classification with unknown class conditional label noise have required that the regression function attains its extrema uniformly on sets of positive measure. We shall consider this problem in the setting of non-compact metric spaces, where the regression function need not attain its extrema. In this setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors). The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour: When the regression function approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate, the optimal learning rates are of the same order as those obtained in the label-noise free setting. If the regression function approaches its extrema more gradually then classification performance necessarily degrades. In addition, we present an algorithm which attains these rates without prior knowledge of either the distributional parameters or the local density. This identifies for the first time a scenario in which finite sample rates are achievable in the label noise setting, but they differ from the optimal rates without label noise.

**Verifiably Safe Off-Model Reinforcement Learning**

The desire to use reinforcement learning in safety-critical settings has inspired a recent interest in formal methods for learning algorithms. Existing formal methods for learning and optimization primarily consider the problem of constrained learning or constrained optimization. Given a single correct model and associated safety constraint, these approaches guarantee efficient learning while provably avoiding behaviors outside the safety constraint. Acting well given an accurate environmental model is an important pre-requisite for safe learning, but is ultimately insufficient for systems that operate in complex heterogeneous environments. This paper introduces verification-preserving model updates, the first approach toward obtaining formal safety guarantees for reinforcement learning in settings where multiple environmental models must be taken into account. Through a combination of design-time model updates and runtime model falsification, we provide a first approach toward obtaining formal safety proofs for autonomous systems acting in heterogeneous environments.

**Finding Nearest Neighbors in graphs locally**

Many distributed learning techniques have been motivated by the increasing size of datasets and their inability to fit into main memory on a single machine. We propose an algorithm that finds the nearest neighbor in a graph locally without the need of visiting the whole graph. Our algorithm is distributed which further encourage scalability. We prove the convergence of the algorithm

**Reinforcement Learning Without Backpropagation or a Clock**

In this paper we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training policies, including artificial neural network policies, that is both \emph{backpropagation-free} and \emph{clock-free}. It is \emph{backpropagation-free} in that it does not propagate any information backwards through the network. It is \emph{clock-free} in that no signal is given to each node in the network to specify when it should compute its output and when it should update its weights. We contend that these two properties increase the biological plausibility of our algorithms and facilitate distributed implementations. Additionally, our approach eliminates the need for customized learning rules for hierarchical RL algorithms like the option-critic.

**KINN: Incorporating Expert Knowledge in Neural Networks**

The promise of ANNs to automatically discover and extract useful features/patterns from data without dwelling on domain expertise although seems highly promising but comes at the cost of high reliance on large amount of accurately labeled data, which is often hard to acquire and formulate especially in time-series domains like anomaly detection, natural disaster management, predictive maintenance and healthcare. As these networks completely rely on data and ignore a very important modality i.e. expert, they are unable to harvest any benefit from the expert knowledge, which in many cases is very useful. In this paper, we try to bridge the gap between these data driven and expert knowledge based systems by introducing a novel framework for incorporating expert knowledge into the network (KINN). Integrating expert knowledge into the network has three key advantages: (a) Reduction in the amount of data needed to train the model, (b) provision of a lower bound on the performance of the resulting classifier by obtaining the best of both worlds, and (c) improved convergence of model parameters (model converges in smaller number of epochs). Although experts are extremely good in solving different tasks, there are some trends and patterns, which are usually hidden only in the data. Therefore, KINN employs a novel residual knowledge incorporation scheme, which can automatically determine the quality of the predictions made by the expert and rectify it accordingly by learning the trends/patterns from data. Specifically, the method tries to use information contained in one modality to complement information missed by the other. We evaluated KINN on a real world traffic flow prediction problem. KINN significantly superseded performance of both the expert and as well as the base network (LSTM in this case) when evaluated in isolation, highlighting its superiority for the task.

**TMAV: Temporal Motionless Analysis of Video using CNN in MPSoC**

Analyzing video for traffic categorization is an important pillar of Intelligent Transport Systems. However, it is difficult to analyze and predict traffic based on image frames because the representation of each frame may vary significantly within a short time period. This also would inaccurately represent the traffic over a longer period of time such as the case of video. We propose a novel bio-inspired methodology that integrates analysis of the previous image frames of the video to represent the analysis of the current image frame, the same way a human being analyzes the current situation based on past experience. In our proposed methodology, called IRON-MAN (Integrated Rational prediction and Motionless textbfANalysis), we utilize Bayesian update on top of the individual image frame analysis in the videos and this has resulted in highly accurate prediction of Temporal Motionless Analysis of the Videos (TMAV) for most of the chosen test cases. The proposed approach could be used for TMAV using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for applications where the number of objects in an image is the deciding factor for prediction and results also show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for the chosen test case. We also introduce a new metric named, Energy Consumption per Training Image (ECTI). Since, different CNN based models have different training capability and computing resource utilization, some of the models are more suitable for embedded device implementation than the others, and ECTI metric is useful to assess the suitability of using a CNN model in multi-processor systems-on-chips (MPSoCs) with a focus on energy consumption and reliability in terms of lifespan of the embedded device using these MPSoCs.

**Cycle-Consistency for Robust Visual Question Answering**

Despite significant progress in Visual Question Answering over the years, robustness of today’s VQA models leave much to be desired. We introduce a new evaluation protocol and associated dataset (VQA-Rephrasings) and show that state-of-the-art VQA models are notoriously brittle to linguistic variations in questions. VQA-Rephrasings contains 3 human-provided rephrasings for 40k questions spanning 40k images from the VQA v2.0 validation dataset. As a step towards improving robustness of VQA models, we propose a model-agnostic framework that exploits cycle consistency. Specifically, we train a model to not only answer a question, but also generate a question conditioned on the answer, such that the answer predicted for the generated question is the same as the ground truth answer to the original question. Without the use of additional annotations, we show that our approach is significantly more robust to linguistic variations than state-of-the-art VQA models, when evaluated on the VQA-Rephrasings dataset. In addition, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the standard VQA and Visual Question Generation tasks on the challenging VQA v2.0 dataset.

**Probabilistic Relational Agent-based Models**

PRAM puts agent-based models on a sound probabilistic footing as a basis for integrating agent-based and probabilistic models. It extends the themes of probabilistic relational models and lifted inference to incorporate dynamical models and simulation. It can also be much more efficient than agent-based simulation.

**Lightweight Feature Fusion Network for Single Image Super-Resolution**

Single image super-resolution(SISR) has witnessed great progress as convolutional neural network(CNN) gets deeper and wider. However, enormous parameters hinder its application to real world problems. In this letter, We propose a lightweight feature fusion network (LFFN) that can fully explore multi-scale contextual information and greatly reduce network parameters while maximizing SISR results. LFFN is built on spindle blocks and a softmax feature fusion module (SFFM). Specifically, a spindle block is composed of a dimension extension unit, a feature exploration unit and a feature refinement unit. The dimension extension layer expands low dimension to high dimension and implicitly learns the feature maps which is suitable for the next unit. The feature exploration unit performs linear and nonlinear feature exploration aimed at different feature maps. The feature refinement layer is used to fuse and refine features. SFFM fuses the features from different modules in a self-adaptive learning manner with softmax function, making full use of hierarchical information with a small amount of parameter cost. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments on benchmark datasets show that LFFN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods with similar parameters.

**Learning to Adaptively Scale Recurrent Neural Networks**

Recent advancements in recurrent neural network (RNN) research have demonstrated the superiority of utilizing multiscale structures in learning temporal representations of time series. Currently, most of multiscale RNNs use fixed scales, which do not comply with the nature of dynamical temporal patterns among sequences. In this paper, we propose Adaptively Scaled Recurrent Neural Networks (ASRNN), a simple but efficient way to handle this problem. Instead of using predefined scales, ASRNNs are able to learn and adjust scales based on different temporal contexts, making them more flexible in modeling multiscale patterns. Compared with other multiscale RNNs, ASRNNs are bestowed upon dynamical scaling capabilities with much simpler structures, and are easy to be integrated with various RNN cells. The experiments on multiple sequence modeling tasks indicate ASRNNs can efficiently adapt scales based on different sequence contexts and yield better performances than baselines without dynamical scaling abilities.

**Deep Spiking Neural Network with Spike Count based Learning Rule**

Deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) support asynchronous event-driven computation, massive parallelism and demonstrate great potential to improve the energy efficiency of its synchronous analog counterpart. However, insufficient attention has been paid to neural encoding when designing SNN learning rules. Remarkably, the temporal credit assignment has been performed on rate-coded spiking inputs, leading to poor learning efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel spike-based learning rule for rate-coded deep SNNs, whereby the spike count of each neuron is used as a surrogate for gradient backpropagation. We evaluate the proposed learning rule by training deep spiking multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and spiking convolutional neural network (CNN) on the UCI machine learning and MNIST handwritten digit datasets. We show that the proposed learning rule achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on all benchmark datasets. The proposed learning rule allows introducing latency, spike rate and hardware constraints into the SNN learning, which is superior to the indirect approach in which conventional artificial neural networks are first trained and then converted to SNNs. Hence, it allows direct deployment to the neuromorphic hardware and supports efficient inference. Notably, a test accuracy of 98.40% was achieved on the MNIST dataset in our experiments with only 10 simulation time steps, when the same latency constraint is imposed during training.

**Shepherding Hordes of Markov Chains**

This paper considers large families of Markov chains (MCs) that are defined over a set of parameters with finite discrete domains. Such families occur in software product lines, planning under partial observability, and sketching of probabilistic programs. Simple questions, like `does at least one family member satisfy a property?’, are NP-hard. We tackle two problems: distinguish family members that satisfy a given quantitative property from those that do not, and determine a family member that satisfies the property optimally, i.e., with the highest probability or reward. We show that combining two well-known techniques, MDP model checking and abstraction refinement, mitigates the computational complexity. Experiments on a broad set of benchmarks show that in many situations, our approach is able to handle families of millions of MCs, providing superior scalability compared to existing solutions.

**SVM-based Deep Stacking Networks**

The deep network model, with the majority built on neural networks, has been proved to be a powerful framework to represent complex data for high performance machine learning. In recent years, more and more studies turn to nonneural network approaches to build diverse deep structures, and the Deep Stacking Network (DSN) model is one of such approaches that uses stacked easy-to-learn blocks to build a parameter-training-parallelizable deep network. In this paper, we propose a novel SVM-based Deep Stacking Network (SVM-DSN), which uses the DSN architecture to organize linear SVM classifiers for deep learning. A BP-like layer tuning scheme is also proposed to ensure holistic and local optimizations of stacked SVMs simultaneously. Some good math properties of SVM, such as the convex optimization, is introduced into the DSN framework by our model. From a global view, SVM-DSN can iteratively extract data representations layer by layer as a deep neural network but with parallelizability, and from a local view, each stacked SVM can converge to its optimal solution and obtain the support vectors, which compared with neural networks could lead to interesting improvements in anti-saturation and interpretability. Experimental results on both image and text data sets demonstrate the excellent performances of SVM-DSN compared with some competitive benchmark models.

**Asymptotically exact data augmentation: models, properties and algorithms**

Data augmentation, by the introduction of auxiliary variables, has become an ubiquitous technique to improve mixing/convergence properties, simplify the implementation or reduce the computational time of inference methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. Nonetheless, introducing appropriate auxiliary variables while preserving the initial target probability distribution cannot be conducted in a systematic way but highly depends on the considered problem. To deal with such issues, this paper draws a unified framework, namely asymptotically exact data augmentation (AXDA), which encompasses several well-established but also more recent approximate augmented models. Benefiting from a much more general perspective, it delivers some additional qualitative and quantitative insights concerning these schemes. In particular, general properties of AXDA along with non-asymptotic theoretical results on the approximation that is made are stated. Close connections to existing Bayesian methods (e.g. mixture modeling, robust Bayesian models and approximate Bayesian computation) are also drawn. All the results are illustrated with examples and applied to standard statistical learning problems.

**Context-Aware Self-Attention Networks**

Self-attention model have shown its flexibility in parallel computation and the effectiveness on modeling both long- and short-term dependencies. However, it calculates the dependencies between representations without considering the contextual information, which have proven useful for modeling dependencies among neural representations in various natural language tasks. In this work, we focus on improving self-attention networks through capturing the richness of context. To maintain the simplicity and flexibility of the self-attention networks, we propose to contextualize the transformations of the query and key layers, which are used to calculates the relevance between elements. Specifically, we leverage the internal representations that embed both global and deep contexts, thus avoid relying on external resources. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and WMT17 Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we conducted extensive analyses to quantity how the context vectors participate in the self-attention model.

**Fast Task-Aware Architecture Inference**

Neural architecture search has been shown to hold great promise towards the automation of deep learning. However in spite of its potential, neural architecture search remains quite costly. To this point, we propose a novel gradient-based framework for efficient architecture search by sharing information across several tasks. We start by training many model architectures on several related (training) tasks. When a new unseen task is presented, the framework performs architecture inference in order to quickly identify a good candidate architecture, before any model is trained on the new task. At the core of our framework lies a deep value network that can predict the performance of input architectures on a task by utilizing task meta-features and the previous model training experiments performed on related tasks. We adopt a continuous parametrization of the model architecture which allows for efficient gradient-based optimization. Given a new task, an effective architecture is quickly identified by maximizing the estimated performance with respect to the model architecture parameters with simple gradient ascent. It is key to point out that our goal is to achieve reasonable performance at the lowest cost. We provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of the framework despite its high computational efficiency.

**A Comparison of Random Task Graph Generation Methods for Scheduling Problems**

How to generate instances with relevant properties and without bias remains an open problem of critical importance for a fair comparison of heuristics. In the context of scheduling with precedence constraints, the instance consists of a task graph that determines a partial order on task executions. To avoid selecting instances among a set populated mainly with trivial ones, we rely on properties that quantify the characteristics specific to difficult instances. Among numerous identified such properties, the mass measures how much a task graph can be decomposed into smaller ones. This property, together with an in-depth analysis of existing random task graph generation methods, establishes the sub-exponential generic time complexity of the studied problem. Empirical observations on the impact of existing generation methods on scheduling heuristics concludes our study.

**Quantile double autoregression**

Many financial time series have varying structures at different quantile levels, and also exhibit the phenomenon of conditional heteroscedasticity at the same time. In the meanwhile, it is still lack of a time series model to accommodate both of the above features simultaneously. This paper fills the gap by proposing a novel conditional heteroscedastic model, which is called the quantile double autoregression. The strict stationarity of the new model is derived, and a self-weighted conditional quantile estimation is suggested. Two promising properties of the original double autoregressive model are shown to be preserved. Based on the quantile autocorrelation function and self-weighting concept, two portmanteau tests are constructed, and they can be used in conjunction to check the adequacy of fitted conditional quantiles. The finite-sample performance of the proposed inference tools is examined by simulation studies, and the necessity of the new model is further demonstrated by analyzing the S&P500 Index.

**The Fairness of Risk Scores Beyond Classification: Bipartite Ranking and the xAUC Metric**

Where machine-learned predictive risk scores inform high-stakes decisions, such as bail and sentencing in criminal justice, fairness has been a serious concern. Recent work has characterized the disparate impact that such risk scores can have when used for a binary classification task and provided tools to audit and adjust resulting classifiers. This may not account, however, for the more diverse downstream uses of risk scores and their non-binary nature. To better account for this, in this paper, we investigate the fairness of predictive risk scores from the point of view of a bipartite ranking task, where one seeks to rank positive examples higher than negative ones. We introduce the xAUC disparity as a metric to assess the disparate impact of risk scores and define it as the difference in the probabilities of ranking a random positive example from one protected group above a negative one from another group and vice versa. We provide a decomposition of bipartite ranking loss into components that involve the discrepancy and components that involve pure predictive ability within each group. We further provide an interpretation of the xAUC discrepancy in terms of resource allocation fairness and make connections to existing fairness metrics and adjustments. We assess xAUC empirically on datasets in recidivism prediction, income prediction, and cardiac arrest prediction, where it describes disparities that are not evident from simply comparing within-group predictive performance.
