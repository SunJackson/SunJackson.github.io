**Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Algorithm** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Imitation learning algorithms can be used to learn a policy from expert demonstrations without access to a reward signal. However, most existing approaches are not applicable in multi-agent settings due to the existence of multiple (Nash) equilibria and non-stationary environments. We propose a new framework for multi-agent imitation learning for general Markov games, where we build upon a generalized notion of inverse reinforcement learning. We further introduce a practical multi-agent actor-critic algorithm with good empirical performance. Our method can be used to imitate complex behaviors in high-dimensional environments with multiple cooperative or competing agents. … 

**Approximate Semantic Matching** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Event-based systems have loose coupling within space, time and synchronization, providing a scalable infrastructure for information exchange and distributed workflows. However, event-based systems are tightly coupled, via event subscriptions and patterns, to the semantics of the underlying event schema and values. The high degree of semantic heterogeneity of events in large and open deployments such as smart cities and the sensor web makes it difficult to develop and maintain event-based systems. In order to address semantic coupling within event-based systems, we propose vocabulary free subscriptions together with the use of approximate semantic matching of events. This paper examines the requirement of event semantic decoupling and discusses approximate semantic event matching and the consequences it implies for event processing systems. We introduce a semantic event matcher and evaluate the suitability of an approximate hybrid matcher based on both thesauri-based and distributional semantics-based similarity and relatedness measures. The matcher is evaluated over a structured representation of Wikipedia and Freebase events. Initial evaluations show that the approach matches events with a maximal combined precision-recall F1 score of 75.89% on average in all experiments with a subscription set of 7 subscriptions. The evaluation shows how a hybrid approach to semantic event matching outperforms a single similarity measure approach.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
DEVS abbreviating Discrete Event System Specification is a modular and hierarchical formalism for modeling and analyzing general systems that can be discrete event systems which might be described by state transition tables, and continuous state systems which might be described by differential equations, and hybrid continuous state and discrete event systems. DEVS is a timed event system. …
