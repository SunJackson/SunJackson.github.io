As the R Markdown ecosystem becomes larger, users now may encounter situations where they have to make decisions on which output format of R Markdown to use.One may found **none of the formats suitable** – the features essential to the output document one wants may scatter across different output formats of R Markdown.

Here is a real example I encountered. I wanted to create a document that:

1. supports bookdown syntax, e.g. text references

1. has an “Edit on GitHub” button for every chapter that links to the edit page of the source `.Rmd` on GitHub


The two features above can be obtained easily with bookdown’s default GitBook output format, but one more feature is essential to the document I want:

1. A document that supports tabbed sections


So basically, I wanted `bookdown::gitbook` that supports tabbed sections, shown in Fig. 1. However, it’s not possible. This is a feature unique to `rmarkdown::html_document`, not `bookdown::gitbook`.

Figure 1: `bookdown::gitbook` supports tabbed sections? This is just a fake figure.


Now I have to find a way, not provided by the default output formats of R Markdown, to create a document with the above three features.My first thought was to find out how to add the tabbed sections feature to `bookdown::gitbook` via JavaScript, but since I’m not familiar with JS, I gave up JavaScript and decided to use the “**native**” R Markdown approach.I turned to `bookdown::html_document2`, which is based on `rmarkdown::html_document` (supports tabbed sections).

The source repo of my document is a bookdown project, which has **several `.Rmd` files**.Each `.Rmd` file starts with a level-one heading and defines a single chapter. Since I wanted tabbed sections from `rmarkdown::html_document`, I have to use `bookdown::html_document2` as the output format, which creates a single HTML output file.

 to Level-one Headings

Setting `bookdown::html_document2` as the output format creates a single document output (as opposed to `bookdown::gitbook` which creates several HTML files by default),so if I want to add an “Edit on GitHub” button for every chapter, I have to track the **original `.Rmd` that generates the particular chapter**.

### “Merge and Knit” vs. “Knit and Merge”

There are two rendering approaches in bookdown. The default is **Merge and Knit**, which combines all source `.Rmd` files into one single `.Rmd` file **then** knits the document.In this case, it would be impossible to track the source `.Rmd` file for each chapter (unless I create a lookup table manually).

I can track the source `.Rmd` files easily, however, if the document is rendered using the **Knit and Merge** approach. When using the **Knit and Merge** approach, the code chunks in the source `.Rmd` files are run and the results embedded **before** the documents get combined together in a single output file. This mean that I can retrieve the source `.Rmd` file name while knitting the file (by `knitr::current_input()`). This gives me all I need to create the link to the edit page of the `.Rmd` source file on GitHub.

### Setting up: `_bookdown.yml`

To switch from the default “**Merge and Knit**” to “**Knit and Merge**”, set `new_session: yes` in `_bookdown.yml`:

```
new_session: yes
before_chapter_script: 'addons/pre_chap.R'
```

### Setting up: `addons/pre_chap.R`

To insert the link to the edit page on GitHub, put ``r edit_btn`` (inline R code) at the end of the h1 heading of each `.Rmd` file, for example:

```
# Function Factories `r edit_btn`
```

`edit_btn` is a string variable holding the link to GitHub. It is computed in the R script `addons/pre_chap.R`, which is run every time before knitting a `.Rmd` file:

```
url <- 'https://github.com/liao961120/parallelCode/edit/master/'
gh_edit_path <- paste0(url, knitr::current_input())

edit_btn <- paste0(', gh_edit_path, '">',
 '![](https://bit.ly/2RRirG7)
![](https://bit.ly/2RRirG7)
,
 'alt="fa-edit" ',
 'class="edit">')
```

To make `addons/pre_chap.R` run every time before knitting a `.Rmd` file, include it in the `before_chapter_script` field in `_bookdown.yml`, as shown in the section, Setting up: `_bookdown.yml`, above.

### Setting up: `_output.yml`

This is the output format I set in `_output.yml`:

```
bookdown::html_document2:
 theme: readable
 highlight: default
 toc: true
 toc_depth: 2
 toc_float:
 collapsed: false
 css: addons/style.css
 self_contained: false
```

## Path Problems Caused by `self_contained: false`

You may notice that I set `self_contained: false` in `_output.yml`. This isn’t necessary and it actually makes things a little more complicated, since, when using `bookdown::html_document2` as the output format, bookdown generates all its dependencies (CSS, JS libraries, figures, etc) in `_bookdown_files` and generates its ouput HTML file in the project root directory but doesn’t move the dependencies and the output HTML to the output directory (defaults to `_book`) nor modify the relative path to dependency files in the output HTML. This causes the links in the output HTML to break.

To fix this, I wrote a bash script to move the output files to the correct places:

```
mv out.html _bookdown_files/index.html
[[ -e out.rds ]] && mv out.rds _bookdown_files/
cp -r addons/ _bookdown_files/

[[ -d docs ]] && rm -r docs
mv _bookdown_files docs
```

For users who don’t use bash, R can be used instead. Check out this post about file manipulation in R.
