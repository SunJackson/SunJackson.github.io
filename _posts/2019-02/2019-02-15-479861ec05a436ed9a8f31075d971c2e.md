In this post, I walk through the code I used to make a nice diagram illustratingthe parameters in a logistic growth curve. I made this figure for a conferencesubmission. I had a tight word limit (600 words) and a complicatedstatistical method (Bayesian nonlinear mixed effects beta regression), so Iwanted to use a diagram to carry some of the expository load. Also, figuresdidnâ€™t count towards the word limit, so that was a bonus ğŸ˜€.

Here I will cover a few different topics:

- The pieces of the three-parameter logistic curve

- What the murky â€œscaleâ€� parameter does in the curve

- How to use `plotmath` to add mathematical copy to a plot


## Growth towards a ceiling



Children can be hard to understand; they are learning to talk after all. Youprobably can imagine a four-year old asking politely asking for something:â€œpwetty pweaseâ€�. This understandability problem is compounded for children withcerebral palsy, because these kids will often have speech-motor impairments ontop of the usual developmental patterns. My current project is a statisticalmodel of how *intelligibility*â€”the probability that an unfamiliar listenerunderstands what a child saysâ€”develops from age 3 to age 8 in children withcerebral palsy.

As an example, the R code plots some (simulated) data that represents a singlechild. They visited our lab 6 times, so we have intelligibility measures foreach of those visits.

One of the interesting features of speech development is that it finishes:Children stop making their usual developmental speech patterns and converge on amature level of performance. They will, no doubt, continue grow and changethrough adolescence, but when it comes to making speech sounds accurately andreliably, most of the developmental change is done by age 8.

For the statistical models, therefore, we expected children to follow a certaindevelopmental trajectory towards a ceiling: Begin at zero intelligibility,show a period of accelerating then decelerating growth, and finally plateau atsome mature level of ability. This pattern of growth can be modelled using alogistic growth curve using three parameters: an asymptote, a midpoint whengrowth is steepest, and a scale which sets the slope of the curve. Below is theequation of the logistic growth curve:


But this equation doesnâ€™t do us any good. If you are like me, you probablystopped paying attention when you saw exp() in the denominator. Hereâ€™s thelogistic curve plotted for these data.

```
xs <- seq(0, 96, length.out = 80)

# Create the curve from the equation parameters
trend <- tibble(
 age = xs,
 asymptote = .8,
 scale = .2,
 midpoint = 48,
 prop = asymptote / (1 + exp((midpoint - age) * scale)))

ggplot(points) + 
 aes(x = age, y = prop) + 
 geom_line(data = trend, color = colors$fit) +
 geom_point(size = 3.5, color = colors$data) +
 scale_x_continuous(
 name = "Age in months", 
 limits = c(0, 96), 
 breaks = scales::extended_breaks(Q = c(24, 12))) + 
 scale_y_continuous(
 name = "Intelligibility",
 limits = c(0, NA),
 labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))

Now, letâ€™s add some labels to mark some key parts of the equation. Oneunfamiliar bit of ggplot technology here might be `annotate()`. Geometryfunctions like `geom_point()` or `geom_text()` are used to draw data that livesin a dataframe using aesthetic mappings defined in `aes()`, and these functiondraws some geometry (like a point or a label) for each row of the data. But wedonâ€™t have rows and rows of data to draw. `annotate()` is meant to handle theseone-off annotations, and we set the aesthetics manually instead of pulling themfrom some data. The first argument of `annotate()` says what kind of geom to usefor the annotation: for example, `"text"` calls on `geom_text()` and `"segment"`calls on `geom_segment()`.

```
colors$asym <- "#E7552C"
colors$mid <- "#3B7B9E"
colors$scale <- "#1FA35C"

p <- ggplot(points) +
 aes(x = age, y = prop) +
 annotate(
 "segment",
 color = colors$mid,
 x = 48, xend = 48,
 y = 0, yend = .4,
 linetype = "dashed") +
 annotate(
 "segment",
 color = colors$asym,
 x = 20, xend = Inf,
 y = .8, yend = .8,
 linetype = "dashed") +
 geom_line(data = trend, size = 1, color = colors$fit) +
 geom_point(size = 3.5, color = colors$data) +
 annotate(
 "text",
 label = "growth plateaus at asymptote",
 x = 20, y = .84,
 # horizontal justification = 0 sets x position to left edge of text
 hjust = 0,
 color = colors$asym) +
 annotate(
 "text",
 label = "growth steepest at midpoint",
 x = 49, y = .05,
 hjust = 0,
 color = colors$mid) +
 scale_x_continuous(
 name = "Age in months", 
 limits = c(0, 96), 
 breaks = scales::extended_breaks(Q = c(24, 12))) + 
 scale_y_continuous(
 name = "Intelligibility",
 limits = c(0, NA),
 labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))

By the way, some other ways to describe the asymptote besides â€œceilingâ€� orâ€œplateauâ€� would be â€œsaturationâ€� which emphasizes how things only change a smallamount near the asymptote or as a â€œlimitingâ€� factor or â€œcapacityâ€� whichemphasizes how growth is no longer tenable after a certain point.

Okay, that just leaves the scale parameter.

## We need to talk about the scale parameter for a second

In a sentence, the scale parameter controls how steep the curve is. The logisticcurve is at its steepest at the midpoint. Growth accelerates, hits the midpoint,then decelerates. The rate of change on the curve is changing constantly alongthe course of the curve. Therefore, it doesnâ€™t make sense to talk about thescale as the growth rate or as the slope in any particular location. Itâ€™s betterto think of it as a growth factor, or umm, scale. I say that it â€œcontrolsâ€� theslope of the curve, because changing the scale will affect the overall stepnessof the curve.

Here is the derivative of the logistic curve. (I had to ask Wolfram Alpha to dothe math for me.) This function tells you the rate of change in the curve at anypoint.


Yeah, I donâ€™t like it either, but I have to show you this mess to show how neatthings are at the midpoint of the curve. When *t* is the midpoint, algebraicmagic happens ğŸ�†. All of the (mid âˆ’ *t*) parts become 0, exp(0) is 1, so everythingsimplifies a great deal. Check it out.


In our case, with a scale of .2 and asymptote of .8, the slope at 48 months is(.2 / 4) * 8 which is .04. When the curve is at its steepest, for the dataillustrated here, intelligibility grows at a rate of 4 percentage points permonth. Thatâ€™s an upper limit on growth rate: This child never gains more than 4percentage points per month.

Now, we can add annotate the plot with an arrow with this slope at the midpoint.That seems like a good representation because this point is where the scale ismost transparently related to the curveâ€™s shape.

```
# Compute endpoints for segment with given slope in middle
slope <- (.2 / 4) * .8
x_step <- 2.5
y1 <- .4 + slope * -x_step
y2 <- .4 + slope * x_step

p <- p +
 geom_segment(
 x = 48 - x_step, xend = 48 + x_step,
 y = y1, yend = y2,
 size = 1.2,
 color = colors$scale,
 arrow = arrow(ends = "both", length = unit(.1, "in"))) +
 annotate(
 "text",
 label = "scale controls slope of curve",
 x = 49, y = .38, 
 color = colors$scale, hjust = 0)
p

```

## Adding the equation

For my conference submission, I didnâ€™t want to include the equation in the text.It was just too low-level of a detail for the 600-word limit. So I added theequation to the plot using`plotmath`.Iâ€™m not exactly sure what this feature should be called, but `?plotmath` iswhat you type to open the help page, so thatâ€™s what I call it. You can add mathto a plot by providing an `expression()` which is parsed into mathematical copy,or by passing a string and setting `parse = TRUE`. Here is a demo of bothapproaches.

```
ggplot(tibble(x = 1:3)) + 
 aes(x = x) +
 geom_text(
 aes(y = 1),
 label = expression(1 + 100 + pi)) +
 geom_text(
 aes(y = .5), 
 label = "frac(mu, 100)", 
 parse = TRUE) + 
 xlim(0, 4) + 
 ylim(0, 1.1)
#> Warning in is.na(x): is.na() applied to non-(list or vector) of type
#> 'expression'

```

![](https://i0.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/plotmath-demo-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


```

# (I don't know what this warning is about.)

```

For this plot, weâ€™re going to create a helper function that pre-sets `parse` to`TRUE` and pre-sets the location for the equation.

```
# Helper to plot an equation in a pre-set spot
annotate_eq <- function(label, ...) {
 annotate("text", x = 0, y = .6, label = label, parse = TRUE, 
 hjust = 0, size = 4, ...)
}

```

Then we just add the equation to the plot.

```
p + annotate_eq(
 label = "f(t)==frac(asymptote, 1 + exp((mid-t)%*%scale))", 
 color = colors$fit)

```

![](https://i0.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq1-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq1-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


This is a perfectly serviceable plot, but we can get fancier. I gave theparameter annotations different colors for a reason ğŸ˜‰.

### Phantom menaces

Plotmath provides a function called `phantom()` for adding placeholders toan equation. `phantom(x)` will make space for *x* in the equation but itwonâ€™t draw it. Therefore, we can `phantom()` out all of the parameters to drawthe non-parameter parts of the equation in black.

```
p1 <- p +
 annotate_eq(
 label = "
 f(t) == frac(
 phantom(asymptote), 
 1 + exp((phantom(mid) - t) %*% phantom(scale))
 )",
 color = colors$fit) 
p1

```

![](https://i0.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2a-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2a-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Then we layer on the other parts of the equation in different colors, using`phantom()` as needed so we donâ€™t overwrite the black parts. We also use`atop()`; it does the same thing as `frac()` except it doesnâ€™t draw a fractionline. Hereâ€™s the addition of the asymptote.

```
p2 <- p1 + 
 annotate_eq(
 label = "
 phantom(f(t) == symbol('')) ~ atop(
 asymptote, 
 phantom(1 + exp((mid-t) %*% scale))
 )",
 color = colors$asym)
p2

```

![](https://i2.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2b-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/tjmahr.github.io/figs//2019-02-15-anatomy-of-a-logistic-growth-curve/fit-eq2b-1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


But the other parameters are not that simple. The plotmath help page states thatâ€œA mathematical expression must obey the normal rules of syntax for any Rexpressionâ€� so that means that we canâ€™t do something like `phantom(1 + ) x"`because the `1 + ` is not valid R syntax. So to blank out parts ofexpressions, we create expressions using `paste()` to put symbols next to eachother and `symbol()` to refer to symbols/operators as characters.

I have to be honest, however: it took a lot of fiddling to get this work right.Therefore, I have added the following disclaimer: ğŸš¨ *Donâ€™t study this code.Just observe what is possible, but observe all the hacky code required.* ğŸš¨

```
p2 +
 annotate_eq(
 label = "
 phantom(f(t) == symbol('')) ~ atop(
 phantom(asymptote), 
 phantom(1 + exp((mid-t) * symbol(''))) ~ scale
 )",
 color = colors$scale) +
 annotate_eq(
 label = "
 phantom(f(t) == symbol('')) ~ atop(
 phantom(asymptote), 
 paste(
 phantom(paste(1 + exp, symbol(')'), symbol(')'))),
 mid,
 phantom(paste(symbol('-'), t, symbol(')') * scale))
 )
 )",
 color = colors$mid)

```

There we have itâ€”my wonderful, colorful diagram! Take *that* word count!

By the way, if you know a better way to plot partially colorized math equationsor how to blank out subexpressions in an easier way, I would love to hear it.
