We are announcing the development of a new statistical user interface for R. I’m really excited about it and I hope that your will be too. Vivid is a rich document format deeply integrated with RStudio that mixes user interface elements, code and output. I firmly believe that the next million R users are going to fall in love with R first through the lens of a statistical user interface. Vivid aims to be that interface.

Vivid is in its developmental infancy, but we would love feedback and collaborators. If you are interested in testing and/or helping us build this tool, let us know!
