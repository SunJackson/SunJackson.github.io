“Solving data quality problems requires investment, and it’s an investment no business can avoid. Poor data quality can lead to compliance issues, legal challenges and increased effort from all sides. Over time, as data (or the information derived from it) decays, inefficiency and inaccuracy becomes a serious issue that can hamper progress throughout the organisation. Customers also have higher expectations and feel more empowered to complain if they don’t feel their data is being handled correctly.” Martin Doyle ( October 23, 2014 )
