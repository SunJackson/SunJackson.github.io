It is often the case that a dataset contains significant outliers – or observations that are significantly out of range from the majority of other observations in our dataset. Let us see how we can use *robust regressions* to deal with this issue.

I described in another tutorial how we can run a linear regression in R. However, this does not account for the outliers in our data. So, how can we solve this?

## Plots

A useful way of dealing with outliers is by running a *robust regression*, or a regression that adjusts the weights assigned to each observation in order to reduce the skew resulting from the outliers.

In this particular example, we will build a regression to analyse *internet usage in megabytes* across different observations. You will see that we have several outliers in this dataset. Specifically, we have three incidences where internet consumption is vastly higher than other observations in the dataset.

Let’s see how we can use a robust regression to mitigate for these outliers.

Firstly, let’s plot *Cook’s distance* and the *QQ Plot*:

### Cook’s Distance

We can see that a plot of Cook’s distance shows clear outliers, and the QQ plot demonstrates the same (with a significant number of our observations not lying on the regression line).

When we get a summary of our data, we see that the maximum value for usage sharply exceeds the *mean* or *median*:

## OLS Regression

Let’s now run a standard OLS regression and see what we come up with.

We see that along with the estimates, most of our observations are significant at the 5% level and the R-Squared is reasonably high at 0.8371.

However, we need to bear in mind that this regression is not accounting for the fact that significant outliers exist in our dataset.

## Cook’s Distance

A method we can use to determine outliers in our dataset is *Cook’s distance*. As a rule of thumb, if Cook’s distance is greater than **1**, or if the distance in absolute terms is significantly greater than others in the dataset, then this is a good indication that we are dealing with an outlier.

We are adding *Cook’s distance* and *standardized residuals* to our dataset. Observe that we have the highest Cook’s distance and the highest standaridized residual for the observation with the greatest internet usage.

## Huber and Bisquare Weights

At this point, we can now adjust the *weights* assigned to each observation to adjust our regression results accordingly.

Let’s see how we can do this using *Huber* and *Bisquare* weights.

### Huber Weights

### Bisquare weighting

In both of the above instances, observe that a much lower weight of *0.092* is assigned to observation *966* using Huber weights, and a weight of 0 is assigned to the same observation using Bisquare weighting.

In this regard, we are allowing the respective regressions to adjust the weights in a way that yields lesser importance to outliers in our model.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to:

- Screen for outliers using Cook’s distance and QQ Plots

- Why standard linear regressions do not necessarily adjust for outliers

- How to use weighting techniques to adjust for such anomalies
