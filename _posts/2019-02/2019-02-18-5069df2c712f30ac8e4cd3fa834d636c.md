WiGLE has been around a *while* and is a great site to explore the pervasiveness or sparsity of Wi-Fi (and cellular) networks around the globe. While interactive use is fun, WiGLE also has a free API (so long as you obey the EULA and arenâ€™t abusive) that lets you explore a little deeper if you register for an account, get a key, and use the WIP `wiglr`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)

 | GL| GH package.

Install from your least offensive social coding site:

```
devtools::install_git("https://sr.ht.com/~hrbrmstr/wiglr")
# or
devtools::install_gitlab("hrbrmstr/wiglr")
# or (if you must)
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/wiglr")

```

read the code (to ensure R package developers are pwning or tracking you),and â€¦after putting your â€œEncoded for useâ€� token in the `WIGLE_API_KEY` environment variableâ€¦start exploring!

Letâ€™s pull all the country stats and plot the top 20:

```
library(wiglr)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(tidyverse) # for show

cc <- wigle_country_stats()

top_n(cc, 20) %>% # show top 20 
 mutate(country = factor(country, levels = rev(country))) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(count, country)) +
 geom_segment(aes(xend=0, yend=country), size = 6, color = ft_cols$blue) +
 scale_x_comma(position = "top") +
 labs(
 x = "# Networks", y = NULL,
 title = "WiGLE Top 20 Countries"
 ) +
 theme_ipsum_rc(grid = "X")

```

We can also supply a bounding box and find all the Wi-Fi access points in the vicinity and use `leaflet` to make a handy interactive map (you can add other columns, too, to find fully open ones):

```
library(leaflet)

wifi_box <- wigle_bbox_search(43.2468, 43.2806, -70.9282, -70.8025)

wifi_box$results %>% 
 mutate(labs = sprintf("SSID: `%s`Encryption: %s", ssid, encryption)) %>% 
 leaflet() %>% 
 addTiles() %>% 
 addCircleMarkers(~trilong, ~trilat, radius = 1, popup = ~labs)

```


Thereâ€™s good but not complete WiGLE API coverage:

- `wigle_about_me`: Get WiGLE user object for the current logged-in user

- `wigle_api_key`: Get or set WIGLE_API_KEY value

- `wigle_bbox_search`: Get WiGLE named map of general statistics

- `wigle_country_stats`: Get WiGLE statistics organized by country

- `wigle_region_stats`: Get WiGLE statistics for a specified country, organized by region

- `wigle_site_stats`: Get WiGLE named map of general statistics


### FIN

The package is a WIP but the API is really straightforward, so if youâ€™re looking to contribute to a (dare I say â€œfun!â€�) open source project in 2019 nowâ€™s your chance! Just drop an issue on whatever social coding site you prefer (ping me in a comment if you use something besides SourceHut, GitLab or GitHub and Iâ€™ll get the package up there) and spec out what youâ€™d like to do *or* just file a well-articulated PR. Potential areas to enhance are:

- support for more search parameters

- a function for automatic pagination

- cover the remaining search/retrieval API endpoints

- investigate how to use R to *submit* readings

- create an internal package Shiny app for exploring WiGLE straight from R

- develop standard base visualizations and add them as package functions

- write a vignette

- improve package docs

- develop a statistical model for the likelihood on finding free/open Wi-Fi in an area or the impact of Wi-Fi/cellular deserts on communities by layering in Census data


Working with or developing for the package may also help shed some light on yet-another-way weâ€™re exposed in the digital world.![](https://i0.wp.com/rud.is/b/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leaf-1.png?resize=672%2C480&ssl=1)

As always youâ€™ll get judgement-free help/suggestions. full credit in the DESCRIPTION and the fame and glory of CRAN if it ever makes its way through the process. The package does *just enough* for me right now so it will be a while before I get to the above TODO list if others donâ€™t jump in first.
