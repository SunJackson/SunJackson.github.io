**Compressed Randomized UTV (CoR-UTV)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Low-rank matrix approximations play a fundamental role in numerical linear algebra and signal processing applications. This paper introduces a novel rank-revealing matrix decomposition algorithm termed Compressed Randomized UTV (CoR-UTV) decomposition along with a CoR-UTV variant aided by the power method technique. CoR-UTV is primarily developed to compute an approximation to a low-rank input matrix by making use of random sampling schemes. Given a large and dense matrix of size $m\times n$ with numerical rank $k$, where $k \ll \text{min} $, CoR-UTV requires a few passes over the data, and runs in $O(mnk)$ floating-point operations. Furthermore, CoR-UTV can exploit modern computational platforms and, consequently, can be optimized for maximum efficiency. CoR-UTV is simple and accurate, and outperforms reported alternative methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Simulations with synthetic data as well as real data in image reconstruction and robust principal component analysis applications support our claims. … 

**Ordinal Monte Carlo Tree Search (Ordinal MCTS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In many problem settings, most notably in game playing, an agent receives a possibly delayed reward for its actions. Often, those rewards are handcrafted and not naturally given. Even simple terminal-only rewards, like winning equals 1 and losing equals -1, can not be seen as an unbiased statement, since these values are chosen arbitrarily, and the behavior of the learner may change with different encodings, such as setting the value of a loss to -0:5, which is often done in practice to encourage learning. It is hard to argue about good rewards and the performance of an agent often depends on the design of the reward signal. In particular, in domains where states by nature only have an ordinal ranking and where meaningful distance information between game state values are not available, a numerical reward signal is necessarily biased. In this paper, we take a look at Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a popular algorithm to solve MDPs, highlight a reoccurring problem concerning its use of rewards, and show that an ordinal treatment of the rewards overcomes this problem. Using the General Video Game Playing framework we show a dominance of our newly proposed ordinal MCTS algorithm over preference-based MCTS, vanilla MCTS and various other MCTS variants. … 

**Scaled Exponentially-Regularized Linear Unit (SERLU)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recently, self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) have been proposed with the intention to avoid batch or weight normalization. The key step in SNNs is to properly scale the exponential linear unit (referred to as SELU) to inherently incorporate normalization based on central limit theory. SELU is a monotonically increasing function, where it has an approximately constant negative output for large negative input. In this work, we propose a new activation function to break the monotonicity property of SELU while still preserving the self-normalizing property. Differently from SELU, the new function introduces a bump-shaped function in the region of negative input by regularizing a linear function with a scaled exponential function, which is referred to as a scaled exponentially-regularized linear unit (SERLU). The bump-shaped function has approximately zero response to large negative input while being able to push the output of SERLU towards zero mean statistically. To effectively combat over-fitting, we develop a so-called shift-dropout for SERLU, which includes standard dropout as a special case. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 show that SERLU-based neural networks provide consistently promising results in comparison to other 5 activation functions including ELU, SELU, Swish, Leakly ReLU and ReLU. …
