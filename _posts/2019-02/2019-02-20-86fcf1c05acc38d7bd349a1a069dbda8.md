To make getting started with `rquery` (an advanced query generator for `R`) easier we have re-worked the package `README` for various data-sources (including `SparkR`!).




Here are our current examples:

For the `MonetDBLite` the query diagrammer shows a repeated calculation that we decided was best to leave in.
