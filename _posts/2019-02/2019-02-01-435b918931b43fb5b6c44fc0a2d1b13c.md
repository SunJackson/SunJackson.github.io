A new version of `dqrng` has made it onto the CRAN servers after a brief hick-up. Thanks to the CRAN team in general and Uwe Ligges in particular for their relentless efforts.

This versions adds a new RNG to be used together with the provided distribution functions: The 64 bit version of the 20 rounds Threefry engine (Salmon et al., 2011 <doi:10.1145/2063384.2063405>, http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/) from the `sitmo` package. Thanks to James Balamuta for adding the C++11 version of Threefry to his package.

In addition, the PCG headers have been updated to the most recent version. Thanks to Aaron Lun for the heads-up and the pointer to two packages on BioConductor that are using `dqrng`: DropletUtils and scran.

There have also been two more technical changes: On the one hand the package is now prepared for the future, since `-DSTRICT_R_HEADERS` is added to `PKG_CPPFLAGS` in `src/Makevars`.

On the other hand I have added unit tests for the C++ interface. I first tried `Catch` since I am using `testthat` already. However, I did not like compiling test code into the final library. Instead I have added C++ files that are compiled using `Rcpp::sourceCpp()` and run during the test. This is also a more realistic test of the C++ interface.
