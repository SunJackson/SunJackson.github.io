President Jair Bolsonaro’s job approval ratings average 39.5% during his first quarter in office so far (from January through late February). Compared to the former presidents, for which I’ve estimates, his quarterly job approval ratings are above the overall average for the inauguration term (31%). However, his ratings trail quarterly averages of the Workers’ Party presidents, Lula I and II, and Dilma I.
