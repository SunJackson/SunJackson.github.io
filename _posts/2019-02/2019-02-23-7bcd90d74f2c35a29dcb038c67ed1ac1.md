Recently ran into something interesting in the `R` macros/quasi-quotation/substitution/syntax front:

Romain François: “[email protected]_lionelhenry reveals planned double curly syntax At #satRdayParis as a possible replacement, addition to !! and enquo()”

It appears `!!` is no longer the last word in substitution (it certainly wasn’t the first).




The described effect is actually already pretty easy to achieve in `R`.

Or if you don’t want to perform the quoting by hand.

And we can use the same Thomas Lumley / `bquote()` notation for string interpolation.

The `.()` notation has a great history in `R` and has been used by `data.table` for years.
