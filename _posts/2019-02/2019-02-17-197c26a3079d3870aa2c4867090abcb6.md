**Byzantine Stochastic Gradient Descent (BSGD)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper studies the problem of distributed stochastic optimization in an adversarial setting where, out of the $m$ machines which allegedly compute stochastic gradients every iteration, an $\alpha$-fraction are Byzantine, and can behave arbitrarily and adversarially. Our main result is a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which finds $\varepsilon$-approximate minimizers of convex functions in $T = \tilde{O}\big( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2 m} + \frac{\alpha^2}{\varepsilon^2} \big)$ iterations. In contrast, traditional mini-batch SGD needs $T = O\big( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2 m} \big)$ iterations, but cannot tolerate Byzantine failures. Further, we provide a lower bound showing that, up to logarithmic factors, our algorithm is information-theoretically optimal both in terms of sampling complexity and time complexity. … 

**Turbo Filtering** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this manuscript a method for developing novel filtering algorithms through the parallel concatenation of two Bayesian filters is illustrated. Our description of this method, called turbo filtering, is based on a new graphical model; this allows us to efficiently describe both the processing accomplished inside each of the constituent filter and the interactions between them. This model is exploited to develop two new filtering algorithms for conditionally linear Gaussian systems. Numerical results for a specific dynamic system evidence that such filters can achieve a better complexity-accuracy tradeoff than marginalized particle filtering. … 

**Hypergraph-based Outlier Test for Categorical Data (HOT)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
As a widely used data mining technique, outlier detection is a process which aims to find anomalies while providing good explanations. Most existing detection methods are basically designed for numeric data, however, real-life data such as web pages, business transactions and bioinformatics records always contain categorical data. So it causes difficulty to find reasonable exceptions in the real world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel outlier mining method based on hypergraph model for categorical data. Since hy- pergraphs precisely capture the distribution characteristics in data subspaces, this method is effective in identifying anomalies in dense subspaces and presents good interpre- tations for the local outlierness. By selecting the most rel- evant subspaces, the problem of ‘curse of dimensionality’ in very large databases can also be ameliorated. Further- more, the connectivity property is used to replace the dis- tance metrics, so that the distance-based computation is not needed anymore, which enhances the robustness for han- dling missing-value data. The fact that connectivity com- putation facilitates the aggregation operations supported by most SQL-compatible database systems, makes the mining process much efficient. Finally, we give experiments and analysis which show that our method can find outliers in categorical data with good performance and quality. …
