Last week I had the honor of giving a 1 hour talk about Choroplethr at a private company.

When this company reached out to me about speaking there, I originally planned to give the same talk I gave at CDC two years ago.

But as I reviewed the CDC talk, I realized two things:

1. My ability to teach and explain Choroplethr has improved a lot since then.

1. Choroplethr has changed in the last few years.


Because of this, I decided to rewrite the talk from scratch.

I wanted to share this new and improved resource with a wider audience, so I just recorded myself giving this new talk. You can view the talk below.

I hope this helps you get the most out of Choroplethr!


Interested in having me give this talk at your company? Contact me and let me know!
