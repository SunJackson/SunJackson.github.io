Today Dirk Eddelbuettel, James Balamuta and Ivan Pavlov are happy to announce the first release of a reworked R interface to the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.

Started as a GSoC 2018 project, the new rvw package was built to give R users easier access to a variety of efficient machine learning algorithms. Key features that promote this idea and differentiate the new rvw from existing Vowpal Wabbit packages in R are:

- A reworked interface that simplifies model manipulations (direct usage of CLI arguments is also available)

- Support of the majority of Vowpal Wabbit learning algorithms and reductions

- Extended `data.frame` converter covering different variations of Vowpal Wabbit input formats


Below is a simple example of how to use the renewed rvw’s interface:

More information is available in the Introduction and Examples sections of the wiki.

The rvw links directly to `libvw` and so initially we offer a Docker container in order to ship the most up to date package with everything needed.
