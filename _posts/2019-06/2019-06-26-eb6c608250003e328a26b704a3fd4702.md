There is interest in converting relational query languages (that work both over SQL databases and on local data) into `data.table` commands, to take advantage of `data.table`‘s superior performance. Obviously if one wants to use `data.table` it is best to learn `data.table`. But if we want code that can run multiple places a translation layer may be in order.

In this note we look at how this translation is commonly done.





The `dtplyr` developers recently announced they are making changes to `dtplyr` to support two operation modes:

> 
Note that there are two ways to use `dtplyr`:


 Eagerly [WIP]. When you use a dplyr verb directly on a data.table object, iteagerly converts the dplyr code to data.table code, runs it, and returns anew data.table. This is not very efficient because it can’t take advantageof many of data.table’s best features.


 Lazily. In this form, trigged by using `lazy_dt()`, no computation isperformed until you explicitly request it with `as.data.table()`,`as.data.frame()` or `as_tibble()`. This allows dtplyr to inspect thefull sequence of operations to figure out the best translation.

This is a bit confusing, but we can unroll it a bit.


The first “eager” method is how `dplyr` (and later `dtplyr`) has *always* converted `dplyr` pipelines into `data.table` realizations.It is odd to mark this as “WIP” (work in progress?), as this has been `dplyr`‘s strategy since the first released version of `dplyr` (verson 0.1.1 2014-01-29).


The second “lazy” method is the *proper* way to call `data.table`. Our own `rqdatatable` package has been calling `data.table` this way for over a year (ref). It is *very* odd that `dplyr` didn’t use this good strategy for the `data.table` adaptor, as it is the strategy `dplyr` uses in its `SQL` adaptor.


Let’s take a look at the current published version of `dtplyr` (0.0.3) and how its eager evaluation works. Consider the following 4 trivial functions: that each add one to a `data.frame` column multiple times.

```
base_r_fn <- function(df) {
 dt <- df
 for(i in seq_len(nstep)) {
 dt$x1 <- dt$x1 + 1
 }
 dt
}

dplyr_fn <- function(df) {
 dt <- df
 for(i in seq_len(nstep)) {
 dt <- mutate(dt, x1 = x1 + 1)
 }
 dt
}

dtplyr_fn <- function(df) {
 dt <- as.data.table(df)
 for(i in seq_len(nstep)) {
 dt <- mutate(dt, x1 = x1 + 1)
 }
 dt
}

data.table_fn <- function(df) {
 dt <- as.data.table(df)
 for(i in seq_len(nstep)) {
 dt[, x1 := x1 + 1]
 }
 dt[]
}
```

`base_r_fn()` is idiomatic `R` code, `dplyr_fn()` is idiomatic `dplyr` code, `dtplyr_fn()` is a idiomatic `dplyr` code operating over a `data.table` object (hence using `dtplyr`), and `data.table_fn()` is idiomatic `data.table` code.

When we time running all of these functions operating on a 100000 row by 100 column data frame for 1000 steps we see each of them takes the following time to complete the task on average:

The “eager” `dtplyr` system is about 100 times slower than `data.table`. This trivial task is one of the *few* times that `data.table` isn’t by far the fastest implementation (in tasks involving grouped summaries, joins, and other non-trivial operations `data.table` typically has a large performance advantage, ref).

Here is the same data presented graphically.

This is why we don’t consider “eager” the proper way to call `data.table`, it *artificially* makes `data.table` *appear* slow. This is the negative impression of `data.table` that the `dplyr`/`dtplyr` adaptors have been falsely giving `dplyr` users for the last five years. `dplyr` users either felt they were getting the performance of `data.table` through `dplyr` (if they didn’t check timings), or got a (false) negative impression of `data.table` (if they did check timings).

Details of the timings can be found here.

As we have said: the “don’t force so many extra copies” methodology has been in `rqdatable` for quite some time, and in fact works well. Some timings on a similar problem are shared here.

Notice the two `rqdatatable` timings have some translation overhead. This is why using `data.table` directly is, in general, going to be a superior methodology.
