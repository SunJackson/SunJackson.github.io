####  ***Variables***

- `x <- (1:10)`

- `x = (1:10)`

- `(1:10) -> x`

- `assign(â€œxâ€�, 1:10)`


All of the above ways assign an array from `1` to `10` to variable `x`.

These are the assigning operators `=`,`->`, `<-`*.*

Another common function for creating a vector or a list is the `c(â€¦)` function.

- `c(1,10:13)` The output for this would be an array `1 10 11 12 13`. This means merging of comma separated objects/variables.

- `c(1:5, 10.5, â€œnextâ€�)` The output for this would be an array `â€œ1â€� â€œ2â€� â€œ3â€� â€œ4â€� â€œ5â€� â€œ10.5â€� â€œnextâ€�`*.*

- `y = c(1,2,3)` *&* `x = c(y, 1, y)` This is an example of using variables to create new variables. Over here the value of `y` would be `1 2 3` while that of `x` would be `1 2 3 1 1 2 3`*.*


For further usage of `c(â€¦)` function refer-

 **c function | R Documentation**_This is a generic function which combines its arguments. The default method combines its arguments to form a vectorâ€¦_www.rdocumentation.org

####  ***Built-in*** Functions

- `c(â€¦)`_â€”â€Š_As explained above.

- `ls()` *or* `objects()`_â€Šâ€”â€Š_Gives a list of existing objects that are made.

- `rm(â€œxâ€�)`_â€Šâ€”â€Š_Deletes an object. Parameter being name of the object.

- `sum(â€œxâ€�)`_â€Šâ€”â€Š*Gives the sum of the vector `x`*.For example, if_ `x` *is* `1 2 3 1 1 2 3`then `sum(â€œxâ€�)` would be`13`.

- `sqrt(â€œxâ€�)`_â€Šâ€”â€Š_Gives square root of the vector `x`.*F* or example if `x` is `1 4 9` then `sqrt(â€œxâ€�)` would be another vector with values `1 2 3`.

- `seq(â€¦)`_â€Šâ€”â€Š_This function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It takes different parameters like `from` *(Start value of sequence*), `to` *(End value of sequence*), `by` *(Number by which the sequence is to be incremented*), `length.out` *(Length of sequence*) and `along.with` _(_This is a list of vector with length n and is used only to get the length of this passed list. Weird *ğŸ˜·)*Example:- `seq(from=1, to=4, by=0.5)`â€Šâ€”â€ŠGives a sequence from `1` to `4` with `0.5` increment.More on `seq(â€¦)` here.

- `paste(â€¦)` *This function is used to make strings using concatenation of vectors using 2 parameters namely* `sep` *&* `collapse`*.* `sep` provides a separator between the concatenated vectors while `collapse` provides a separator which concatenates the values in the concatenated vector. (Inception? ğŸ¤’) Letâ€™s learn it with some examples.`paste(â€œxyzâ€�, 1:3)`â€” `â€œxyz 1â€� â€œxyz 2â€� â€œxyz 3â€�` (This is without `sep` & `collapse`*)*`paste(â€œxyzâ€�, c(1,2,â€�variableâ€�,3), sep=â€�,â€�)`â€Šâ€”`â€œxyz,1â€� â€œxyz,2â€� â€œxyz,variableâ€� â€œxyz,3â€�` (This is only with `sep` )`paste(c(1:5), c(5:10), sep = â€œ: â€œ, collapse = â€œ; â€œ)`â€Šâ€”â€Š`â€œ1: 5; 2: 6; 3: 7; 4: 8; 5: 9; 1: 10â€�` (This is with `sep` and `collapse`; Notice here that this forms a single string ğŸ˜„.)More on `paste(â€¦)` here.

- `rep(x, â€¦)`_â€Šâ€”_â€ŠAs the name suggests, this function is used to repeat the existing vector. The parameters this function can take are `times` *(Number of times the vector should be repeated*), `length.out` *(Desired length of output vector*) & `each` *(Number of times each element of the vector should be repeated*) `rep(c(1,2,3), 3) or rep(c(1:3), times=3)`â€” `1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3``rep(c(1:3), each=3)`â€” `1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3`More on `rep(x, â€¦)` here.

####  User Defined Functions

The below example shows a simple way to write a single line function which returns the square of a variable. The function name over here is `fn`.

```
fn <- function(a) {a*a}

fn(10)

```

Example for a block of code in a function.

```
fn -> function(a, b) { c = a * b c = c + b print(x)}

fn(10, 20)

```

Functions with `loops`,`if-else`.

```
primeNumber = function(n) {

if(n>=2) {

s = seq(2,n) p = c() #Initialising the vector which stores prime numbers

{% raw %}
for(i in seq(2,n)) { if(any(s == i) { p = c(p, i) s = c(s[(s%%i) != 0], i) } } return(p) } else { stop("Input greater than 2") }}
{% endraw %}

```

The above example returns a vector with all the *prime numbers* upto `n` passed to the function. The `stop` function here stops the execution and throws an error.

The initial `p = c()` is used to initialise the vector which stores the prime number. And `s = seq (2,n)` is used to initialise the vector till `n`, which is then looped.

The loop checks if the value is present in the vector `s` defined earlier using the any function. And if it matches then it appends that value to the prime vector and updates the vector to be checked with i.e `s` with all the numbers that are not divisible with the current `i`

**At the end of the loop, the** `p` **vector contains all the prime numbers.**
