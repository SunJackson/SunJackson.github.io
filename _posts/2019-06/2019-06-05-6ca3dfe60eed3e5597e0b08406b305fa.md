## Creating Matrix

Let us start by creating a Matrix in R:

## Element-wise operations

Let us start move over to element-wise operations in R:

Firt we will make an Addition in R:

Next we will make a Subtraction in R:

Now we will try a Multiplication in R:

Furthermore we will make a Division in R:

Let us try a Exponentiation in R:

## Basic Matrix Operations

Now we will move over to basic matrix operations in R.

Let us begin with making a Transpose in R:

Now let us try a Multiplication in R:

We can also mae a Outer Product in R:

It is also possible to make Cross Products in R:

Now we will make a Diagonal in R:

## Combine Matrices

Let us move over to combining matrices in R.First we will make a Horizontally combine in R:

Now let us try a Vertically combine in R:

## Means

We will now move over to create Means in R.

We will begin witg a ColMeans in R:

Next we will make a RowMeans in R:

## Sums

Now let us try making Sums in R.

We will begin with ColSums in R:

Now we will try RowSums in R:

## Advanced Matrix Operations

Lastly we will deal with Advanced matrix operations in R.First let us try Cholesky Factorization in R, which demands that Matrix should be positive definite:

Now let us deal with Eigenvalues in R:

Let us move over to Moore-Pernrose Generalized Inverse in R:

Now we will make an QR Decomposition in R:

Now let us try making an Inverse in R:

Let us try to Solve Linear Equation in R:

Now we will make Singular Value Decomposition in R:

Lastly we will make a first order derivative and second derivative hessian matrix:

Let us display the first order derivative matrix with complex method:

Let us also display the second order derivative hessian matrix with Richardson method:
