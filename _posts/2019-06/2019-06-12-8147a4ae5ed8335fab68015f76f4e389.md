A new RcppArmadillo release based on a new Armadillo upstream release arrived on CRAN, and will get to Debian shortly. It brings a few upstream changes, including extened interfaces to LAPACK following the recent gcc/gfortran issue. See below for more details.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 610 other packages on CRAN.

Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.9.500.2.0 (2019-06-11)


Upgraded to Armadillo release 9.500.2 (Riot Compact)


Expanded `solve()` with `solve_opts::likely_sympd` to indicate that the given matrix is likely positive definite


more robust automatic detection of positive definite matrices by `solve()` and `inv()`


faster handling of sparse submatrices


expanded `eigs_sym()` to print a warning if the given matrix is not symmetric


extended LAPACK function prototypes to follow Fortran passing conventions for so-called "hidden arguments", in order to address GCC Bug 90329; to use previous LAPACK function prototypes without the "hidden arguments", `#define ARMA_DONT_USE_FORTRAN_HIDDEN_ARGS` before `#include `






Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
