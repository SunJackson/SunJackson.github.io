An earlier post from February, describes a Shiny app that allows to search among currently more than 4000 economic articles that have an accessible data and code supplement. Finally, I managed to configure an nginx reverse proxy server and now you can also access the app under a proper https link here:

https://ejd.econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de

(I was very positively surprised how easy is it was to change http to https using certbot). Some colleagues told me that they could not access the app under the originally posted link:

http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:3200/ejd/

I am not sure about the exact reason, but perhaps some security settings don’t allow to access web sites on a non-standard port like 3200. Hopefully the new link helps.

Since my initial post, the number of articles has grown, and I included new journals like Econometrica or AER Insights.

The main data for my app can be downloaded as a zipped SQLite database from my server. Let us do some analysis.

```
library(RSQLite)
library(dbmisc)
library(dplyr)
db = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),"articles.sqlite") %>%
 set.db.schemas(
 schema.file=system.file("schema/articles.yaml",
 package="EconJournalData")
 )

articles = dbGet(db,"article")
fs = dbGet(db,"files_summary")

```

Let us look grouped by journal at the share of articles whose code supplement has R files:

```
fs %>% 
 left_join(select(articles, id, journ), by="id") %>%
 group_by(journ) %>%
 mutate(num_art = n_distinct(id)) %>%
 filter(file_type=="r") %>%
 summarize(
 num_art = first(num_art),
 num_with_r = n(),
 share_with_r=round((num_with_r / first(num_art))*100,2)
 ) %>%
 arrange(desc(share_with_r))

```
|journ|num_art|num_with_r|share_with_r
|ecta|109|17|15.6|
|jep|113|11|9.73|
|restud|216|12|5.56|
|aejmic|114|5|4.39|
|aer|1453|46|3.17|
|aejpol|378|11|2.91|
|aejapp|385|11|2.86|
|aejmac|282|8|2.84|
|jeea|115|2|1.74|
|restat|733|6|0.82|

We see that there is quite some variation in the share of articles with R code going from 15.6% in Econometrica (ecta) to only 0.82% in the Review of Economics and Statistics (restat). (The statistics exclude all articles that don’t have a code supplement or a supplement whose file types I did not analyse, e.g. because it is too large or the ZIP files are nested too deeply.)

Overall, we still have a clear dominance of Stata in economics:

```
# Number of articles with analyes data & code supplementary
n_art = n_distinct(fs$id)

# Count articles by file types and compute shares
fs %>% group_by(file_type) %>%
 summarize(
 count = n(), 
 share=round((count / n_art)*100,2)
 ) %>%
 # note that all file extensions are stored in lower case
 filter(file_type %in% c("do","r","py","jl","m")) %>%
 arrange(desc(share))

```
|file_type|count|share
|do|2834|70.18|
|m|979|24.24|
|r|129|3.19|
|py|42|1.04|
|jl|2|0.05|

Roughly 70% of the articles have Stata `do` files and almost a quarter Matlab `m` files and only slightly above 3% R files.

I also meanwhile have added a log file to the app that anonymously stores data about which articles that have been clicked on. The code below shows the 20 most clicked on articles so far:

```
dat = read.csv("article_click.csv")

dat %>%
 group_by(article) %>%
 summarize(count=n()) %>%
 na.omit %>%
 arrange(desc(count)) %>%
 print(n=20)

```

For a nice thumbnail in R-bloggers let us finish with a screenshot of the app:
