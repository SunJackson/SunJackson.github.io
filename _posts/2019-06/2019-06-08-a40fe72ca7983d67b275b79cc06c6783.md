### 
Saturday Morning Videos: L4DC: Learning for Dynamics and Control, May 30 & 31, 2019, MIT









> 
Over the next decade, the biggest generator of data is expected to be devices which sense and control the physical world.This explosion of real-time data that is emerging from the physical world requires a rapprochement of areas such as machine learning, control theory, and optimization. While control theory has been firmly rooted in tradition of model-based design, the availability and scale of data (both temporal and spatial) will require rethinking of the foundations of our discipline. From a machine learning perspective, one of the main challenges going forward is to go beyond pattern recognition and address problems in data driven control and optimization of dynamical processes.Our overall goal is to create a new community of people that think rigorously across the disciplines, asks new questions, and develops the foundations of this new scientific area





Here are the videos followed by the posters at the conference:
