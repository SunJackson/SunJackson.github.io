I am going to use regression, decision trees, and the random forest algorithm to predict combined miles per gallon for all 2019 motor vehicles.  The raw data is located on the EPA government site

After preliminary diagnostics, exploration and cleaning I am going to start with a multiple linear regression model.

The variables/features I am using for the models are: Engine displacement (size), number of cylinders, transmission type, number of gears, air inspired method, regenerative braking type, battery capacity Ah, drivetrain, fuel type, cylinder deactivate, and variable valve.  

There are 1253 vehicles in the dataset (does not include pure electric vehicles) summarized below.

The fitted MSE is 6.8 and predicted MSE of 6.83.  Some of the below residuals are too large.  The extreme large residual is a Hyundai Ioniq which none of the models predict very well as it is unique vehicle (versus the other data points).

Let’s try a decision tree regression model.

```
#regression tree fullm_reg_tree_full <- rpart(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ .,data = train,method = "anova",)#regression tree tunedm_reg_tree_trimmed <- rpart(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ .,data = train,method = "anova",control = list(minsplit = 10, cp = .0005))
```

#rpart.plot(m_reg_tree_full)plotcp(m_reg_tree_full)

pred_decision_tree_full <- predict(m_reg_tree_full, newdata = test)mse_tree_full <- RMSE(pred = pred_decision_tree_full, obs = test$fuel_economy_combined) ^2

pred_decision_tree_trimmed <- predict(m_reg_tree_trimmed, newdata = test)mse_tree_trimmed <- RMSE(pred = pred_decision_tree_trimmed, obs = test$fuel_economy_combined) ^2plotcp(m_reg_tree_trimmed)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/alpha-analysis.com/Pictures/MPG/decision_tree.png?resize=450%2C447&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

After tuning the decision tree the predicted MSE is 6.20 which is better than the regression model.

Finally let’s try a random forest model.  The random forest should produce the best model as it will attempt to remove some of the correlation within the decision tree structure.

```
#random forestm_random_forest_full <-randomForest(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ ., data = train)predict_random_forest_full <- predict(m_random_forest_full, newdata = test)mse_random_forest_full <- RMSE(pred = predict_random_forest_full, obs = test$fuel_economy_combined) ^ 2
```

which.min(m_random_forest_full$mse)

#random forest tunedm_random_forest <- randomForest(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ ., data = train, ntree = 250)plot(m_random_forest)predict_random_forest <- predict(m_random_forest, newdata = test)mse_random_forest <- RMSE(pred = predict_random_forest, obs = test$fuel_economy_combined) ^ 2

plot(tmp$test.fuel_economy_combined - tmp$r.predict_random_forrest., ylab = "residuals",main = "Random Forest")

varImpPlot(m_random_forest)

The error stabilizes at 250 trees.  randomForest() by default uses 500 trees which is unnecessary.

After tuning the random forest the model has the lowest fitted and predicted MSE of 3.67 which is substantially better than the MSE of the decision tree 6.2

The random forest also has an r-squared of .9

Engine size, number of cylinders, and transmission type are the largest contributors to accuracy.
