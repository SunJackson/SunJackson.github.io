## bayestestR 0.2 is here!

As you might have heard from previous posts, we have recently started to collaborate around the new **easystats project**, a suite of packages designed to make your life easier. One of the packages, **bayestestR**, has just been updated on CRAN.

And this release is **so packed with new features** and **improvements** that it would be impossible to present them all in one post! We have added the computation of different types of **Bayes factors (BF)**, new **plotting methods** (available in the `see` package), a new meta-function, `describe_posterior`, that computes **everything at once**, and moreâ€¦

We also improved the **documentation**, with new **tutorials** and **articles** so that Bayesian analysis can hold no secrets from you. Check them out:
