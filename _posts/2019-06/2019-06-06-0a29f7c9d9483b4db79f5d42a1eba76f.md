When we’re programming in R (or any other language, for that matter), we often want to control *when* and *how* particular parts of our code are executed. We can do that using **control structures** like if-else statements, for loops, and while loops.

Control structures are blocks of code that determine how other sections of code are executed based on specified parameters. You can think of these as a bit like the instructions a parent might give a child before leaving the house:

“**If** I’m not home by eight, make yourself dinner.”

Control structures set a condition and tell R what to do when that condition is met or not met. And unlike some kids, R will *always* do what we tell it to! You can learn more about control structures in the R documentation if you would like.

In this tutorial, we’ll talk about how to use control structures by building a simple algorithm that tells you who won or lost a soccer match. We assume some familiarity with basic data structures, arithmetic operations, and comparison operators. If you need to get a handle of these basic R programming concepts, check out our free Introductory R Programming course, which covers all of the necessary prerequisites.

(This tutorial is based on our free intermediate R programming course, so check that out as well! It’s interactive and will allow you to write and run code right in your browser.)

## Understanding If-Else Statements

Let’s say we’re watching a sports match that decides which team makes the playoffs. We could visualize the possible outcomes using this tree chart:

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ifelse-1.png)


As we can see in the tree chart, there are only two possible outcomes. If Team A wins, they go to the playoffs. If Team B wins, then they go.

Let’s start by trying to represent this scenario in R. We can use an **if statement** to write a program that prints out the winning team.

If statements tell R to run a line of code if a condition returns `TRUE`. An if statement is a good choice here because it allows us to control which statement is printed depending on which outcome occurs.

The figure below shows a conditional flow chart and the basic syntax for an if statement:

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/if_v2-1.png)


Our if statement’s condition should be an expression that evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If the expression returns TRUE, then the program will execute all code between the brackets { }. If FALSE, then no code will be executed.

Knowing this, let’s look at an example of an if statement that prints the name of the team that won.

```
team_A < - 3 # Number of goals scored by Team A
team_B < - 1 # Number of goals scored by Team B
if (team_A > team_B){
 print ("Team A wins")
}
```

```
"Team A wins"

```

It worked! Because Team A had more goals than Team B, our conditional statement(`team_A > team_B`) evaluates to `TRUE`, so the code block below it runs, printing the news that Team A won the match.

## Adding the else statement

In the previous exercise, we printed the name of the team that will make the playoffs based on our expression. Let’s look at a new matchup of scores. What if Team A had 1 goal and Team B had 3 goals. Our team_A > team_B conditional would evaluate to `FALSE`. As a result, if we ran our code, nothing would be printed. Because the if statement evaluates to false, the code block inside the if statement is not executed:

```
team_A < - 1 # Number of goals scored by Team A
team_B < - 3 # Number of goals scored by Team B
if (team_A > team_B){
 print ("Team A will make the playoffs")
}

```

If we return to our original flow chart, we can see that we’ve only coded a branch for one of the two possibilities:

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/team_a-1.png)


Ideally, we’d like to make our program account for both possibilities and “Team B will make the playoffs” if the expression evaluates to FALSE. In other words, we want to be able to handle both conditional branches:

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/team_a_b-1.png)


To do this, we’ll add an else statement to turn this into what’s often called an **if-else statement**. In R, an if-else statement tells the program to run one block of code if the conditional statement is `TRUE`, and a *different* block of code if it is `FALSE`. Here’s a visual representation of how this works, both in flowchart form and in terms of the R syntax:

**![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ifelse_flow-2.png)**

So we need to add a block of code that runs if our conditional expression `team_A > team_B` returns `FALSE`. We can do this by adding an `else` statement. If our comparison operator evaluates to FALSE, let’s print “Team B will make the playoffs.”

```

team_A < - 1 # Number of goals scored by Team A
team_B < - 3# Number of goals scored by Team B
if (team_A > team_B){
 print ("Team A will make the playoffs")
} else {
 print ("Team B will make the playoffs")
}

```

```
"Team B will make the playoffs"
```

## Using the for loop to run our code

Now that we’ve used an if-else statement to display the results of one match, what if we wanted to find the results of *multiple* matches? Let’s say we have a list of vectors containing the results of our match: `matches <- list(c(2,1),c(5,2),c(6,3))`.

Keep in mind that we’ll have to use `[[]]` when indexing, since we want to return a single value within each list on our list, not the value with the list object. Indexing with `[]` will return a *list object*, not the value.

So, for example, in the code we have above, `matches[[2]][1]` is calling the *first* index of the *second* list (i.e., Team A’s score in Game 2).

Assuming that Team A’s goals are listed first (the first index of the vector) and Team B’s are second, we could find the results the results using if-else statements would look like this:

```

if (matches[[1]][1] > matches[[1]][2]){
 print ("Win")
} else {
 print ("Loss")
} 

if (matches[[2]][1] > matches[[2]][2]){
 print ("Win")
} else { 
 print ("Loss")
} 

if (matches[[3]][1] > matches[[3]][2]){
 print ("Win")
} else { 
 print ("Loss")
}

```

And this would print:

```
"Win"
"Win"
```

This code works, but if we look at this approach it’s easy to see a problem. Writing this out for *three* games is already cumbersome. What if we had a list of 100 or 1000 games to evaluate?

We can improve on our code by performing the same action using a **for loop**. A for loop repeats a chunk of code multiple times for each *element* within an object. Here’s a flow chart representation, and the syntax in R (which looks very similar to the if syntax).

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/forloop_v2-1.png)


In this diagram, for each value in the sequence, the loop will execute the code block. When there are no more values left in the sequence, this will return `FALSE` and exit the loop.

Let’s break down what’s going on here.

- **sequence**: This is a set of objects. For example, this could be a vector of numbers c(1,2,3,4,5).

- **value**: This is an iterator variable you use to refer to each value in the sequence. See variables naming conventions in the first course for valid variable names.

- **code block**: This is the expression that’s evaluated.


Let’s look at a concrete example. We’ll write a quick loop that prints the value of items in a list, and we’ll create a short list with two items: Team A and Team B.

```

teams <- c("team_A","team_B")
for (value in teams){
 print(value)
}

```

```
"team_A" 
"team_B"

```

Since `teams` has two values, our loop will run twice. Here’s a visual representation of what’s going on

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/forloop_v6-1.png)


Once the loop displays the result from the first iteration, the loop will look at the next value in the position. As a result, it’ll go through another iteration. Since there aren’t any more values in the sequence, the loop will exit after “team_B”.

In aggregate, the final result will look like this:

```
"team_A" 
"team_B"

```

## Adding the results of a loop to an object

Now that we’ve written out our loop, we’ll want to store each result of each iteration in our loop. In this post, we’ll store our values in a vector, since we’re dealing with a single data type.

As you may already know from our free R Fundamentals course, we can combine vectors using the `c()` function. We’ll use the same method to store the results of our for loop.

We’ll start with this for loop:

```

for (match in matches){
 print(match)
}

```

Now, let’s say we wanted to get the total goals scored in a game and store them in the vector. The first step we’d need to do would be to add each score from our list of lists together, which we can do using the `sum()` function. We’ll have our code loop through `matches` to calculate the sum of the goals in each match.

```

matches <- list(c(2,1),c(5,2),c(6,3))
for (match in matches){
 sum(match)
}
```

But we still haven’t actually saved those goal totals anywhere! If we want to save the total goals for each match, we can initialize a new vector and then append each additional calculation onto that vector, like so:

```

matches <- list(c(2,1),c(5,2),c(6,3))
total_goals <- c()
for (match in matches){
 total_goals <- c(total_goals, sum(match))
}
```

## Using if-else statements within for loops

Now that we’ve learned about if-else statements and for loops in R, we can take things to the next level and use if-else statements within our for loops to give us the results of *multiple* matches.

To combine two control structures, we’ll place one control structure in between the brackets `{ }` of another.

We’ll start with these match results for team_A:

```
matches <- list(c(2,1),c(5,2),c(6,3))

```

Then we’ll create a for loop to loop through it:

```
for (match in matches){
}

```

This time, rather than print our results, let’s add an if-else statement into the for loop.

In our scenario, we want our program to print whether Team A won or lost the game. Assuming Team A’s goals is the first of each pair of values and the opponents is the second index, we’ll need to use a comparison operator to compare the values. After we make this comparison, if team_A’s score is higher, we’ll print “Win”. If not, we’ll print “Lose”.

When indexing into the iterable variable match, we can use either `[]` or `[[]]` since the iterable is a vector, not a list.

```

matches < - list(c(2,1),c(5,2),c(6,3))
for (match in matches){
 if (match1 > match2){
 print("Win")
 } else {
 print ("Lose")
 }
}

```

```
"Win"
"Win"
```

## Breaking the for loop

Now that we’ve added an if-else statement, let’s look at how to stop a for loop based on a certain condition. In our case, we can use a `break` statement to stop the loop as soon as we see Team A has won a game.

Using the for loop we wrote above, we can insert the break statement inside our if-else statement.

```

matches < - list(c(2,1),c(5,2),c(6,3))
for (match in matches){
 if (match1 > match2){
 print("Win")
 break
 } else {
 print("Lose")
 }
}
```

```
"Win"
```

## Using a while loop

In the previous exercise, we used a for loop to repeat a chunk of code that gave us the result of the match. Now that we’ve returned the results of each match, what if we wanted to count the number of wins to determine if they make the playoffs? One method of returning the results for the first four games is to use a **while** loop.

A while loop is a close cousin of the for loop. However, a while loop will check a logical condition, and keep running the loop as long as the condition is true. Here’s what the syntax of a while loop looks like:

```
while(condition){
 expression
}
```

In flow-chart form:

![](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/while_v2-1.png)


If the condition in the while loop is *always* true, the while loop will be an infinite loop, and our program will never stop running. This is something we definitely want to avoid! When writing a while loop, we want to ensure that at some point the condition will be false so the loop can stop running.

Let’s take a team that’s starting the season with zero wins. They’ll need to win 10 matches to make the playoffs. We can write a while loop to tell us whether the team makes the playoffs:

```
wins <- 0
while (wins < 10){
 print ("Does not make playoffs")
 wins <- wins + 1
}
```

```
"Does not make playoffs"
"Does not make playoffs"
```

Our loop will stop running when wins hits 10. Notice, that we continuously add 1 to the win total, so eventually, the win < 10 condition will return `FALSE`. As a result, the loop exits.

Let’s write our first while loop, counting Team A wins!

## Using an if-else statement within a while loop

Now that we’ve printed the status of the team when they don’t have enough wins, we’ll add a feature that indicates when they *do* make the playoffs.

To do this, we’ll need to add an if-else statement into our while loop. Adding an if-else statement into a while loop is the same as adding it to s for loop, which we’ve already done. Returning to our scenario where 10 wins allows Team A to make the playoffs, let’s add an if-else conditional.

The if-else conditional will go between the brackets of the while loop, in the same place we put it into the for loop earlier.

```

wins <- 0
while (wins <= 10){
 if (wins < 10){
 print("does not make playoffs")
 } else {
 print ("makes playoffs")
 }
 wins <- wins + 1
}
```

```
"does not make playoffs"
"does not make playoffs"
"makes playoffs"
```

## Breaking the while loop

Let’s say the maximum number of wins a team can have in a season is 15. To make the playoffs, we’ll still need 10 wins, so we can end our loop as soon as Team A has hit this number.

To do this, we can use another `break` statement. Again, this functions the same way in a while loop that it does in a for loop; once the condition is met and `break` is executed, the loop ends.

```

wins <- 0playoffs <- c()
while (wins <= 15){
 if (wins < 10){
 print("does not make playoffs")
 playoffs <- c(playoffs, "does not make playoffs")
 } else {
 print ("makes playoffs")
 playoffs <- c(playoffs, "makes playoffs")
 break
 }
 wins <- wins + 1
}
```

```
"does not make playoffs"
"does not make playoffs"
"makes playoffs"
```

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, we’ve gone from building a basic if statement all the way to writing some much more complex programs that execute different blocks of code, loop, and end loops based on conditions we’ve defined. These concepts — if-else statements, for loops, and while loops — are important aspects of R programming, and you’ll find they have equivalents in most other programming languages too!

If you’d like to learn more about R for data science, this tutorial is based on our R Intermediate course, which is part of our Data Analyst in R track. It’s completely free, and you can write code (and get it checked) from right in your browser, so if you haven’t tried it already, now’s the time to take the plunge and commit to building your data science skills!
