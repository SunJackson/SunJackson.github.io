We’ve been to some incredible evening reception venues over the past few years – The Tower of London, HMS Belfast, The Imperial War Museum and a cruise down the Thames! Every year our attendees tell us how valuable the conference networking opportunities are, and our evening reception is the perfect occasion to chat with other friendly R users over a few drinks and find out how they use R.

This year we are excited to announce we will be visiting Proud Embankment on the evening of Wednesday 11 September.

We will be travelling in style to the venue in vintage double-decker red London buses, upon arrival we will be greeted by the wonderfully stylish and decadent venue, followed by free drinks and canapés. We are pulling out all the stops this year and we will be treating you to some of London’s best cabaret performers.

But what makes our EARL Conference evening receptions is YOU! We are proud to run an event that supports a community as friendly and welcoming as the R community. If you’d like to join us please visit the EARL website for more information, and don’t miss out on our early bird ticket offers.
