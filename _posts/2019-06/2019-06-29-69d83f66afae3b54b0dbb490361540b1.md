I recently came across the article “How Mapping Shots In The NBA Changed It Forever” and although I am not a big basketball fan, I was impressed by the visualizations. I actually bought the book “Sprawlball” by Kirk Goldsberry afterwards, where this was taken from. I can only recommend it, even if you are not a huge basketball fan since it contains a lot of inspirational dataviz material.

In this post, I am going to try to replicate the first three visualizations of the linked article, which turned out to be harder than expected! Additionally, I will use the `rayshader` package to turn one of the figures into anice 3D plot.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(showtext)
library(hexbin)
```

When I decided to do this replication, I was pretty sure that it is doomed to failure since I willnot get the right data (precise shot locations). Turns out, stats.nba.com has an incredible rich (but undocumented)API. I will not go into detail on how I got all the relevant data, but if you want to get it yourself,check out toddwschneider’s R package `ballr`, specifically this function.

I took several hours, but at the end I managed to put together a dataset of all shots in the NBA between2006 and 2019. In the following, we will only need 2013-2018 though.

The first figure in the article is the easiest to reproduce, since it is a simplescatterplot. The only thing that took a bit of time was to find a suitable font. In the end, I settledwith Rokkitt from Google, which can be loaded via the `showtext` package as follows.

```
font_add_google("Rokkitt", "rokkitt")
showtext_auto()
```

A second issue was to get the court in the background. The `ballr` package luckily has a `plot_court` functionwhich I tweaked slightly for my purposes.

```
col_scheme <- c("firebrick4","darkorange2","gold1",
 "chartreuse4","cadetblue2","darkorchid4")

p <- plot_court()+
 geom_point(data = scatter_shots,
 aes(loc_x,loc_y,col = shot_distance),size = 0.1)+
 scale_color_gradientn(colours = col_scheme,breaks = c(0,30),limits = c(0,30),
 name = "SHOT DISTANCE IN FEET")+
 guides(colour = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 11, barheight = 0.8,ticks = F,
 title.position = "top",title.hjust = 0.5))+
 labs(title = "NBA SHOT LOCATIONS\n2014-15")+
 theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5,size = 32,colour="grey45",
 family="rokkitt",face = "bold"),
 legend.position = "bottom",legend.justification = c(0.88,0),
 legend.text = element_text(size=14,colour = "grey45",family = "rokkitt"),
 legend.title = element_text(size=13,colour = "grey45",family = "rokkitt"),
 legend.box.margin = margin(c(-50,0,3,0)),
 plot.margin = margin(3,3,3,3, unit = "pt"))

ggsave("shots2014-15.png",plot = p ,width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 100)
```

Looks pretty close to the original. Although it was quite straightforward to reproduce this figure, I still learned two things: How to tweak a colourbar legend with `guide_colourbar` and how to use the legend.justification argument of `theme`.

Reproducing the second figure of the article is way more involved than the first (at least it was for me).The figure has a lot of very smooth areas and I would assume that it is more of an illustration than an accuratedepiction of the data (which is of course totally fine in this context!). I tried out several things, andin the end I settled for a combination of “hexbin aggregation” and interpolating the data on a regular grid.

The first step was to aggregate shots in roughly the same location into cells and calculate the field goal percentagesfor each cell. I did so using the `hexbin` function of the package with the same name.

```
tbl <- vroom::vroom(c("shots2013-14.csv","shots2014-15.csv","shots2015-16.csv",
 "shots2016-17.csv","shots2017-18.csv")) %>% 
 select(loc_x,loc_y,shot_made_numeric,shot_value,shot_distance)

bns <- 20 
hb <- hexbin(x = tbl$loc_x,y = tbl$loc_y,xbins = bns,IDs = TRUE)

shot_perc <- tbl %>% 
 mutate(hex = [email protected]) %>% 
 group_by(hex) %>% 
 dplyr::summarise(perc = sum(shot_made_numeric)/n())
shot_perc <- left_join(shot_perc,tibble(hex = [email protected],x = [email protected],y = [email protected]),by = "hex")
```

I played around with the number of bins and found that 20 seemed to be a good trade-off.Afterwards, I created a regular grid with 1000 points per dimension and interpolated theshot percentages with the `interp` function from the `akima` package.

```
npts <- 1000
xyz_interp <- akima::interp(x = shot_perc$x,y = shot_perc$y,
 z = shot_perc$perc,nx = npts,ny = npts,linear = T)

shot_perc_plot <- tibble(x = rep(xyz_interp[[1]],npts),
 y = rep(xyz_interp[[2]],each=npts),
 z = c(xyz_interp[[3]])) %>% 
 dplyr::filter(!is.na(z) & y >= -2) %>% 
 mutate(z=if_else(y < 0 & z <= 0.35,0.36,z)) %>% 
 mutate(z=if_else(y < 0 & z >= 0.45 & x > 5,0.45,z)) %>% 
 mutate(zfill=case_when(z <= 0.35~0.35,
 z <= 0.4~0.40,
 z <= 0.45~0.45,
 z <= 0.50~0.50,
 z <= 0.55~0.55,
 z <= 0.60~0.6,
 TRUE~0.65)) %>% 
 mutate(zfill = as.factor(zfill)) %>% 
 dplyr::filter(sqrt(x^2+(y-hoop_center_y)^2)<=27) 
```

`shot_perc_plot` now contains (interpolated) field goal percentages on a regular gridfor the whole court. Visualizing this is now relatively straightforward with a combinationof `geom_tile`, `geom_contour` and some annotation sugar.

```
p <- ggplot(shot_perc_plot)+
 geom_tile(aes(x,y,fill=zfill))+
 geom_contour(aes(x,y,z=z),
 binwidth = 0.03,col="white",size=0.2,linetype="dashed")+

 coord_fixed(ylim = c(-5,30),xlim=c(-22,22))+
 labs(title="FIELD GOAL PERCENTAGES\n2013-14 TO 2017-18")+
 theme_minimal(base_size = 22) +
 theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,size = 48,colour = "grey45",
 family = "rokkitt",face = "bold",lineheight = 0.6),
 legend.position = "bottom",legend.justification = c(0.98,0),

 panel.grid = element_blank(),
 panel.border = element_blank(),

The result is not as smooth as the original but the overall picture is very close to it.

The third figure in the article is pretty much the same as the second. Just with different data.So we can use the same aggregation/interpolation strategy as before.

```
bns <- 20 
hb <- hexbin(x = tbl$loc_x,y = tbl$loc_y,xbins = bns,IDs = TRUE)
shot_pts <- tbl %>% 
 mutate(hex = [email protected]) %>% 
 group_by(hex) %>% 
 dplyr::summarise(pts = sum(shot_made_numeric*shot_value)/n())

shot_pts <- left_join(shot_pts,tibble(hex = [email protected],x = [email protected],y = [email protected]),by="hex")

npts <- 1000
xyz_interp <- akima::interp(x = shot_pts$x,y = shot_pts$y,
 z = shot_pts$pts,nx = npts,ny = npts,linear = T)

shot_pts_plot <- tibble(x = rep(xyz_interp[[1]],npts),
 y = rep(xyz_interp[[2]],each=npts),
 z = c(xyz_interp[[3]])) %>% 
 dplyr::filter(!is.na(z) & y>= -2) %>% 
 mutate(z=if_else(y<1 & z>=0.85 & (between(x,5,20) | between(x,-20,-5)),0.85,z)) %>%
 mutate(zfill=case_when(z<=0.85~0.85,
 z<=0.90~0.90,
 z<=0.95~0.95,
 z<=1.00~1.00,
 z<=1.05~1.05,
 z<=1.10~1.1,
 z<=1.2~1.2,
 TRUE~1.25)) %>% 
 mutate(zfill=as.factor(zfill)) %>% 
 dplyr::filter(sqrt(x^2+(y-hoop_center_y)^2)<=27)
```

If you look closely at the third figure, you will realize that there is a strong cut between thetwo and three point area. So technically, we should have treated the two areas separately and combine theresults in the end. However, I did not manage to do this in a satisfying way, so I stuck with treating bothareas together, which will of course change the figure slightly.

```
p <- ggplot(shot_pts_plot)+
 geom_tile(aes(x,y,fill=zfill))+
 geom_contour(aes(x,y,z=z),binwidth = 0.05,col="white",size=0.2,linetype="dashed")+

Again, the result is not as smooth as the original. Especially the boundary of the two andthree point area looks different. Overall though, I think the figure captures the essentialresult of the original.

Recently, I learned about the awesome `rayshader` package bytylermorganwall. Especially the relativelynew feature of turning any ggplot object into a 3D plot is fascinating! The below codeturns the points per shot figure into a 3D object and produces a short video that navigates theplot.

```
plot_gg(p, width = 5, height = 5, multicore = TRUE, scale = 250, 
 zoom = 0.7, theta = 10, phi = 30, windowsize = c(800, 800))

phivec <- 20 + 70 * 1/(1 + exp(seq(-5, 10, length.out = 180)))
phivecfull <- c(phivec, rev(phivec))
thetavec <- 90 * sin(seq(0,359,length.out = 360) * pi/180) #+270
zoomvec <- 0.5 + 0.5 * 1/(1 + exp(seq(-5, 10, length.out = 180)))
zoomvecfull <- c(zoomvec, rev(zoomvec))

for(i in 1:360) {
 render_camera(theta = thetavec[i],phi = phivecfull[i],zoom = zoomvecfull[i])
 render_snapshot(paste0("anim/frame", i, ".png"))
}

#Run this command in the command line using ffmpeg to stitch together a video:
#ffmpeg -framerate 60 -i frame%d.png -vcodec libx264 raymovie.mp4

#And run this command to convert the video to post to the web:
#ffmpeg -i raymovie.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p -profile:v baseline -level 3 -vf scale=-2:-2 rayweb.mp4
```

This is the result:
