Following on the recent CRAN release of**rTRNG**, it’stime to show its features and usage more in detail.

**rTRNG** isa new package for advanced parallel Random Number Generation in **R**. It relieson TRNG (Tina’s Random NumberGenerator), a state-of-the-art C++ pseudo-random number generator library forsequential and parallel Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, *parallel*random number generators provided by TRNG can be manipulated by `jump` and`split` operations. These allow to `jump` ahead by an arbitrary number of stepsand to `split` a sequence into any desired sub-sequence(s), thus enablingtechniques such as *block-splitting* and *leapfrogging* suitable to parallelalgorithms.

#### Background and Motivation

Monte Carlo simulations provide a powerful computational approach to address awide variety of problems in several domains, such as physical sciences,engineering, computational biology and finance. The independent-samples andlarge-scale nature of Monte Carlo simulations make the corresponding computationsuited for parallel execution, at least in theory. In practice, pseudo-randomnumber generators (RNGs) are intrinsically sequential. This often preventshaving a parallel Monte Carlo algorithm that is *playing fair*, meaning thatresults are independent of the architecture, parallelization techniques andnumber of parallel processes.

#### Advanced Parallel RNG in R

**rTRNG** provides the R user with access to the functionality of the underlyingTRNG C++ library. It makes use ofRcpp andRcppParallelto expose the creation, manipulation and use of pseudo-random streams to R.Moreover, the TRNG library and its headers are made available to other projectscombining R with C++.

Anintroduction to **rTRNG**(pdf)was given at the useR!2017 conference, and is also available as`vignette("rTRNG.useR2017", "rTRNG")`.A second vignette, `vignette("mcMat", "rTRNG")`, shows **rTRNG** in action forthe flexible and consistent (parallel) simulation of a matrix of Monte Carlovariates, represented in the picture above.

The concrete application of such techniques to the simulation of credit defaultswas presented at theR/Finance 2017conference, showing how **rTRNG** can be used for fast sub-portfolio simulation,risk-insight and scenario assessment. The code and data underlying this applieduse-case are hosted onGitHub,as is the correspondingR Markdown output.

Below we illustrate, using simple examples, the several ways **rTRNG** can beused.

##### Base-R-like usage

Similar to base-R (see `?Random`), **rTRNG** allows to select and manipulate a*current* TRNG generator of a given *kind* (e.g. yarn2), and to draw from itusing any of the provided `r_trng` functions:

```
library(rTRNG)
TRNGkind("yarn2") 
TRNGseed(12358)
runif_trng(15)
## [1] 0.580259813 0.339434026 0.221393682 0.369402388 0.542678773
## [6] 0.002851459 0.123996486 0.346813776 0.121799416 0.947124450
## [11] 0.336516569 0.128926181 0.380379891 0.550692382 0.436002654

```

The special `jump` and `split` operations can be applied to the currentgenerator in a similar way:

```
TRNGseed(12358)
TRNGjump(6) # advance by 6 the internal state
TRNGsplit(5, 3) # generate one element every 5 starting from the 3rd
runif_trng(2)
## [1] 0.1217994 0.5506924
# => compare to the full sequence above

```

##### Direct manipulation of generators

*Reference objects* wrapping the underlying C++ TRNG generators can be createdand manipulated in OOP-style, for greater flexibility in using parallel RNGs inR:

```
rng <- yarn2$new()
rng$seed(12358)
rng$jump(6)
rng$split(5, 3)
runif_trng(2, engine = rng)
## [1] 0.1217994 0.5506924

```

##### Parallel generation

*Fair-playing*, multi-threaded generation of random variates from R can beanabled in `r_trng` via argument `parallelGrain > 0`, where the number ofparallel threads is controlled via `RcppParallel::setThreadOptions()`:

```
TRNGseed(12358)
RcppParallel::setThreadOptions(numThreads = 2)
x_parallel <- runif_trng(1e5, parallelGrain = 100)
TRNGseed(12358)
x_serial <- runif_trng(1e5)
identical(x_serial, x_parallel)
## [1] TRUE

```

##### Standalone C++ code

The TRNG C++ library is made available by **rTRNG** to standalone C++ codecompiled with `Rcpp::sourceCpp()` thanks to the `Rcpp::depends` attribute:

```
// [[Rcpp::depends(rTRNG)]]
#include 
#include 
// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::NumericVector exampleCpp() {
 trng::yarn2 rng(12358);
 rng.jump(6);
 rng.split(5, 2); // 0-based index
 Rcpp::NumericVector x(2);
 trng::uniform_dist<>unif(0, 1);
 for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
 x[i] = unif(rng);
 }
 return x;
}

```

```
exampleCpp()
## [1] 0.1217994 0.5506924

```

##### R packages

Creating an R package with C++ code using the TRNG library via **rTRNG** isachieved by


adding `Imports: rTRNG` and `LinkingTo: rTRNG` to the DESCRIPTION file


importing one symbol in the NAMESPACE:`importFrom(rTRNG, TRNG.Version)`


setting the relevant linker flags in Makevars[.win] via `rTRNG::LdFlags()`

- Makevars: `PKG_LIBS += $(shell ${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript -e "rTRNG::LdFlags()")`

- Makevars.win: `PKG_LIBS += $(shell "${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN}/Rscript.exe" -e "rTRNG::LdFlags()")`
