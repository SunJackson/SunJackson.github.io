## Updates

### New publishing method for Git-backed content

This release adds the ability for data scientists to deploy content from Gitrepositories for individual applications within RStudio Connect.

This publishing method is designed to allow data scientists to publish directlyfrom Git repositories to Connect, and have that content get updated at regularintervals without the need for external CI/CD systems like Jenkins or Travis CI.

This publishing method complements the existing methods of:

- Push-button publishing from the RStudio IDE

- Push-button publishing from Jupyter Notebooks

- Programmatic deployment with CI/CD pipelines using the RStudio Connect Server APIs


Refer to the documentation on Git-Backed Content in the UserGuide andAdministrationGuidefor additional information on the configuration and usage of this newfunctionality.

### Publishers can modify vanity URLs for content

Vanity URLs allow administrators to create “vanity paths” for published contentin RStudio Connect, which makes the content available at a customized URL pathrather than a URL path that uses the numeric app ID as an identifier.

This release adds the ability for publishers to modify vanity URLs for publishedcontent without the need for administrators to perform this configuration.

Refer to the documentation on Git-Backed Content in the UserGuideand AdministrationGuidefor additional information on the configuration and usage of this new`Authorization.PublishersCanManageVanities` setting.

### Ability to isolate viewer permissions and discoverability

This release adds the ability for administrators to configure a global settingto prevent viewers from seeing any other registered users, groups, or publishersin RStudio Connect.
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rstudio.com/images/rsc-176-viewer-permissions.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rstudio.com/images/rsc-176-viewer-permissions.png?w=456&ssl=1)


This setting is useful for RStudio Connect environments where users with theviewer role should not able to discover the existence or identities of otherusers, groups, or publishers on the server. With this setting enabled, userswith the viewer role will only be able to discover and view published contentthat they have been explicitly granted access to.

Refer to the Administration Guide Configuration section onAuthorizationfor more information on the `Authorization.ViewersCanOnlySeeThemselves` setting.

### Full support for all SAML providers

RStudio Connect 1.7.4 added support for SAML-basedauthenticationand a subset of identity providers. The 1.7.6 release adds support for allSAML-based identity providers. Refer to the support article on Getting Startedwith SAML in RStudioConnectfor more information.

### Documentation for Server API Cookbook

The RStudio Connect Server APICookbook has been madeavailable as a separate guide and is no longer part of the User Guide.

## Security & Authentication Changes


**Forgot Password Behavior** – When using built-in Password authentication,requesting a password reset via the “forgot password” link no longer fails fornon-existing users, to prevent malicious user enumeration.


**Email Address Changes** – Changes made to the email addresses in userprofiles done manually or via Connect Server API will cause an email to be sentto the old email address, so the user is notified about the new email address inuse.


**Brute-Force Protection** – A protection against brute-force attacks has beenimplemented for all authentication attempts against API calls to Connect usingeither API keys or tokens. After a failed authentication attempt, the user mayhave to wait longer before trying again.


**Enforced Password Complexity** – Use `Password.MinimumScore` to control howcomplex (secure) new passwords must be when using the password authenticationprovider. See the Password Authenticationsectionof the Administration Guide for details.


## Deprecations & Breaking Changes


**Breaking Change** – `Authorization.UsersListingMinRole` has been deprecatedand it should be removed from the configuration file. A warning will be issuedduring startup in the `rstudio-connect.log` if the setting is in use. In thenext release, the presence of this setting will prevent RStudio Connect fromstarting up. Customers using this setting with any value other than the default(viewer) should use `Authorization.ViewersCanOnlySeeThemselves = true` instead.


**Breaking Change** – The `needs_config` field has been removed from theContent entity of the experimental Server API. All Content fields and endpointsto interact with content are provided in the Server API Reference.


Refer to the full release notes formore information on all of the changes and bug fixes in this release.
