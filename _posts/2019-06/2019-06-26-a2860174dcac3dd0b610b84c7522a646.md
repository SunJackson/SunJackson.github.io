*(If you want to jump straight to the cheat sheet section then scroll down to the bottom of the post.)*

Gradient descent is an optimisation method for finding the minimum of a function. It is commonly used in deep learning models to update the weights of the neural network through backpropagation.

In this post, I will summarise the common gradient descent optimisation algorithms used in the popular deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Caffe). The purpose of this post is to make it easy to read and digest (using consistent nomenclature) since there arenâ€™t many such summaries out there, and as a cheat sheet if you want to implement them from scratch.

I have implemented SGD, momentum, Nesterov, RMSprop and Adam in a linear regression problem using gradient descent demo here using JavaScript.

### **What do gradient descent optimisers do?**

 There are 3 main ways how these optimisers can act upon gradient descent:

     (1) modifying the learning rate component, ***Î±***, or(2) modifying the gradient component, ***âˆ‚L/âˆ‚w***, or(3) both.

See the last term in Eqn. 1 below:

Eqn. 1: The terms in stochastic gradient descent

 

> ***Learning rate schedulers vs. Gradient descent optimisers***The main difference between these two is that gradient descent optimisers adapt the learning rate component by multiplying the learning rate with a factor that is a function of the gradients, whereas learning rate schedulers multiply the learning rate by a factor which is a constant or a function of the time step.

For (1), these optimisers multiply a positive factor to the learning rate, such that they become smaller (e.g. RMSprop). For (2), optimisers usually make use of the moving averages of the gradient (momentum), instead of just taking one value like in vanilla gradient descent. Optimisers that act on both (3) are like Adam and AMSGrad.

Fig. 3 is an evolutionary map of how these optimisers evolved from the simple vanilla stochastic gradient descent (SGD), down to the variants of Adam. SGD initially branched out into two main types of optimisers: those which act on (i) the learning rate component, through momentum and (ii) the gradient component, through AdaGrad. Down the generation line, we see the birth of Adam (pun intended ğŸ˜¬), a combination of momentum and RMSprop, a successor of AdaGrad. You donâ€™t have to agree with me, but this is how I see them ğŸ¤­.

### **Notations**

- *tâ€Šâ€”â€Š*time step

- *wâ€Šâ€”â€Š*weight/parameter which we want to update

- *Î±â€Šâ€”â€Š*learning rate

- *âˆ‚L/âˆ‚wâ€Šâ€”â€Š*gradient of *L*, the loss function to minimise, w.r.t. to *w*

- I have also standardised the notations and Greek letters used in this post (hence might be different from the papers) so that we can explore how optimisers â€˜evolveâ€™ as we scroll.

### **1. Stochastic Gradient Descent**

 The vanilla gradient descent updates the current weight *wt*  using the current gradient *âˆ‚L/âˆ‚wt* multiplied by some factor called the learning rate, *Î±.*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kvwgxqwUskRcuXUCr_GFZA@2x.png)


### **2. Momentum**

 Instead of depending only on the current gradient to update the weight, gradient descent with momentum (Polyak, 1964) replaces the current gradient with *Vt* (which stands for velocity), the exponential moving average of current and past gradients (i.e. up to time *t*). Later in this post, you will see that this momentum update becomes the standard update for the gradient component.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*InCwyOtMRcrDXRDxa1xbOg@2x.png)
where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E54ClPDlKFdnfxtQPJL-Ig@2x.png)
and *V* initialised to 0.

Common default value:

> Note that many articles reference the momentum method to the publication by Ning Qian, 1999. However, the paper titled Sutskever et al. attributed the classical momentum to a much earlier publication by Polyak in 1964, as cited above. (Thank you to James for pointing this out.)

### **3. Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)**

 After Polyak had gained his momentum (pun intended ğŸ˜¬), a similar update was implemented using Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (Sutskever et al., 2013). This update utilises *V*, the exponential moving average of what I would call *projected gradients.*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lv3gFs4JGGExNQT-yMTG4A@2x.png)
where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*761QlS02jCLy2JN7cFhOkA@2x.png)
and *V* initialised to 0.

The last term in the second equation is a *projected gradient*. This value can be obtained by going â€˜one step aheadâ€™ using the previous velocity (Eqn. 4). This means that for this time step *t*, we have to carry out another forward propagation before we can finally execute the backpropagation. Hereâ€™s how it goes:

1. Update the current weight *wt* to a *projected weight w* *using the previous velocity.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-T21J7ihoIimw-vc2tii8w@2x.png)
 
1. Carry out forward propagation, but using this *projected weight*.

1. Obtain the *projected gradient* *âˆ‚L/âˆ‚w**.

1. Compute *Vt* and *wt+1* accordingly.


Common default value:

> Note that the original Nesterov Accelerated Gradient paper (Nesterov, 1983) was not about *stochastic* gradient descent and did not explicitly use the gradient descent equation. Hence, a more appropriate reference is the above-mentioned publication by Sutskever et al. in 2013, which described NAGâ€™s application in stochastic gradient descent. (Again, Iâ€™d like to thank Jamesâ€™s comment on Hacker News for pointing this out.)

### **4. AdaGrad**

 Adaptive gradient, or AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), works on the learning rate component by dividing the learning rate by the square root of *S*, which is the cumulative sum of current and past squared gradients (i.e. up to time *t*). Note that the gradient component remains unchanged like in SGD.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZfgWLaJcGAIhzfxk3x1uQQ@2x.png)
where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OZ1C828CHMc2CKveEXfp5g@2x.png)
and *S* initialised to 0.

Notice that *Îµ *is added to the denominator. Keras calls this the *fuzz factor*, a small floating point value to ensure that we will never have to come across division by zero.

Default values (from Keras):

- *Î±* = 0.01

- *Îµ = *10â�»â�·


### **5. RMSprop**

 Root mean square prop or RMSprop (Hinton et al., 2012) is another adaptive learning rate that is an improvement of AdaGrad. Instead of taking cumulative sum of squared gradients like in AdaGrad, we take the exponential moving average of these gradients.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qUXAAhjIijefqNi9O8Ck_w@2x.png)
where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3ms0_D00ckaG2J4g182lUw@2x.png)
and *S* initialised to 0.

Default values (from Keras):

- *Î±* = 0.001

- *Î²* = 0.9 (recommended by the authors of the paper)

- *Îµ = *10â�»â�¶


### **6. Adadelta**

 Like RMSprop, Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) is also another improvement from AdaGrad, focusing on the learning rate component. Adadelta is probably short for â€˜adaptive deltaâ€™, where *delta* here refers to the difference between the current weight and the newly updated weight.

The difference between Adadelta and RMSprop is that Adadelta removes the use of the learning rate parameter completely by replacing it with *D*, the exponential moving average of squared *deltas*.

where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FCQJfccXuK6QaJlSMGXnQA@2x.png)
with *D *and *S* initialised to 0, and

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TscI4WyJTVJaBOXILBoO3A@2x.png)
Default values (from Keras):

- *Î²* = 0.95

- *Îµ = *10â�»â�¶


### **7. Adam**

 Adaptive moment estimation, or Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), is a combination of momentum and RMSprop. It acts upon

      (i) the gradient component by using *V*, the exponential moving average of gradients (like in momentum), and(ii) the learning rate component by dividing the learning rate *Î±* by square root of *S*, the exponential moving average of squared gradients (like in RMSprop).

where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x3fTZJ8wQKlWmvMswbopjw@2x.png)
are the bias corrections, and

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pdnDu3qjtF7pRrWqniiY0Q@2x.png)
with *V *and *S* initialised to 0.

Proposed default values by the authors:

- *Î±* = 0.001

- *Î²*â‚� = 0.9

- *Î²*â‚‚ = 0.999

- *Îµ* = 10â�»â�¸


### **8. AdaMax**

 AdaMax (Kingma & Ba, 2015) is an adaptation of the Adam optimiser by the same authors using infinity norms (hence â€˜maxâ€™). *V *is the exponential moving average of gradients, and *S *is the exponential moving average of past *p*-norm of gradients, approximated to the max function as seen below (see paper for convergence proof).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uB_qUXtHXcp49WQXBVWPrg@2x.png)
where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-41saVRK1mBkJFGB0_Ag0g@2x.png)
is the bias correction for *V* and

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f9UiRCmRPyEba01zN6HujA@2x.png)
with *V *and *S* initialised to 0.

Proposed default values by the authors:

- *Î±* = 0.002

- *Î²*â‚� = 0.9

- *Î²*â‚‚ = 0.999


### **9. Nadam**

 Nadam (Dozat, 2015) is an acronym for Nesterov and Adam optimiser. The Nesterov component, however, is a more efficient modification than its original implementation.

First weâ€™d like to show that the Adam optimiser can also be written as:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8Z1Y_8behfJWsr1iyIGDAA@2x.png)


Eqn. 5: Weight update for Adam optimiser

 

Nadam makes use of Nesterov to update the gradient one step ahead by replacing the previous *V_hat *in the above equation to the current *V_hat*:

where

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UJ_19zdDgfF36i1ght8dZQ@2x.png)
and

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vOR8hRNO7vPsBYj33f3kMQ@2x.png)
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vOR8hRNO7vPsBYj33f3kMQ@2x.png)
with *V* and *S* initialised to 0.

Default values (taken from Keras):

- *Î±* = 0.002

- *Î²*â‚� = 0.9

- *Î²*â‚‚ = 0.999

- *Îµ* = 10â�»â�·


### **10. AMSGrad**

 Another variant of Adam is the AMSGrad (Reddi et al., 2018). This variant revisits the adaptive learning rate component in Adam and changes it to ensure that the current *S *is always larger than the previous time step*.*

where

and

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EyoI7OQ3MFp53jq7XO3w4w@2x.png)
with *V *and *S* initialised to 0.

Default values (taken from Keras):

- *Î±* = 0.001

- *Î²*â‚� = 0.9

- *Î²*â‚‚ = 0.999

- *Îµ* = 10â�»â�·


**Intuition**

Here, Iâ€™d like to share with you some intuition on why gradient descent optimisers use exponential moving average for the gradient component and root mean square for the learning rate component.

**Why take *exponential moving average* of gradients?**

We need to update the weight, and to do so we need to make use of some value. The only value we have is the current gradient, so letâ€™s utilise this to update the weight.

But taking only the current gradient value is not enough. We want our updates to be â€˜better guidedâ€™. So letâ€™s include previous gradients too.

One way to â€˜combineâ€™ the current gradient value and information of past gradients is that we could take a simple average of all the past and current gradients. But this means each of these gradients are equally weighted. This would not be intuitive because spatially, if we are approaching the minimum, the most recent gradient values might provide more information that the previous ones.

Hence the safest bet is that we can take the exponential moving average, where recent gradient values are given higher weights (importance) than the previous ones.

**Why divide learning rate by *root mean square *of gradients?**

The goal is to adapt the learning rate component. Adapt to what? The gradient. All we need to ensure is that when the gradient is large, we want the update to be small (otherwise, a huge value will be subtracted from the current weight!).

In order to create this effect, letâ€™s *divide* the learning rate *Î± *by the current gradient to get an adapted learning rate.

Bear in mind that the learning rate component must always be positive (because the learning rate component, when multiplied with the gradient component, should have the same sign as the latter). To ensure itâ€™s always positive, we can take its absolute value or its square. Letâ€™s take the square of the current gradient and â€˜cancelâ€™ back this square by taking its square root.

But like momentum, taking only the current gradient value is not enough. We want our updates to be â€˜better guidedâ€™. So letâ€™s make use of previous gradients too. And, as discussed above, weâ€™ll take the exponential moving average of past gradients (â€˜mean squareâ€™), then taking its square root (â€˜rootâ€™), hence â€˜root mean squareâ€™. All optimisers in this post which act on the learning rate component does this, except for AdaGrad (which takes cumulative sum of squared gradients).
