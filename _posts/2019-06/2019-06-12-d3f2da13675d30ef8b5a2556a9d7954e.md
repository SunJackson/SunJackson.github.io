I have recently been confronted to a kind of data set and problem that I was not even aware existed:intermittent demand data. Intermittent demand arises when the demand for a certain good arrivessporadically. Let’s take a look at an example, by analyzing the number of downloads for the `{RDieHarder}`package:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(tsintermittent)
library(nnfor)
library(cranlogs)
library(brotools)
```

```
rdieharder <- cran_downloads("RDieHarder", from = "2017-01-01")

ggplot(rdieharder) +
 geom_line(aes(y = count, x = date), colour = "#82518c") +
 theme_blog()
```

Let’s take a look at just one month of data, because the above plot is not very clear, because ofthe outlier just before 2019… I wonder now, was that on Christmas day?

```
rdieharder %>%
 filter(count == max(count))
```

```
## date count package
## 1 2018-12-21 373 RDieHarder
```

Not exactly on Christmas day, but almost! Anyways, let’s look at one month of data:

```
january_2018 <- rdieharder %>%
 filter(between(date, as.Date("2018-01-01"), as.Date("2018-02-01")))

ggplot(january_2018) +
 geom_line(aes(y = count, x = date), colour = "#82518c") +
 theme_blog()
```

Now, it is clear that this will be tricky to forecast. There is no discernible pattern,no trend, no seasonality… nothing that would make it “easy” for a model to learn how to forecastsuch data.

This is typical intermittent demand data. Specific methods have been developed to forecast suchdata, the most well-known being Croston, as detailed inthis paper.A function to estimate such models is available in the `{tsintermittent}` package, written byNikolaos Kourentzeswho also wrote another package, `{nnfor}`, which uses Neural Networks to forecast time series data.I am going to use both to try to forecast the intermittent demand for the `{RDieHarder}` packagefor the year 2019.

Let’s first load these packages:

```
library(tsintermittent)
library(nnfor)
```

And as usual, split the data into training and testing sets:

```
train_data <- rdieharder %>%
 filter(date < as.Date("2019-01-01")) %>%
 pull(count) %>%
 ts()

test_data <- rdieharder %>%
 filter(date >= as.Date("2019-01-01"))
```

Let’s consider three models; a naive one, which simply uses the mean of the training set as theforecast for all future periods, Croston’s method, and finally a Neural Network from the `{nnfor}`package:

```
naive_model <- mean(train_data)

croston_model <- crost(train_data, h = 163)

nn_model <- mlp(train_data, reps = 1, hd.auto.type = "cv")
```

```
## Warning in preprocess(y, m, lags, keep, difforder, sel.lag,
## allow.det.season, : No inputs left in the network after pre-selection,
## forcing AR(1).
```

```
nn_model_forecast <- forecast(nn_model, h = 163)
```

The `crost()` function estimates Croston’s model, and the `h` argument produces theforecast for the next 163 days. `mlp()` trains a multilayer perceptron, and the `hd.auto.type = "cv"`argument means that 5-fold cross-validation will be used to find the best number of hidden nodes. Ithen obtain the forecast using the `forecast()` function. As you can read from the Warning messageabove, the Neural Network was replaced by an auto-regressive model, AR(1), because no inputs wereleft after pre-selection… I am not exactly sure what that means, but if I remove the big outlierfrom before, this warning message disappears, and a Neural Network is successfully trained.

In order to rank the models, I follow this paperfrom Rob J. Hyndman, who wrote a very useful book titled Forecasting: Principles and Practice,and use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error, or MASE. You can also read this shorter pdfwhich also details how to use MASE to measure the accuracy for intermittent demand. Here is thefunction:

```
mase <- function(train_ts, test_ts, outsample_forecast){

 naive_insample_forecast <- stats::lag(train_ts)

 insample_mae <- mean(abs(train_ts - naive_insample_forecast), na.rm = TRUE)
 error_outsample <- test_ts - outsample_forecast

 ase <- error_outsample / insample_mae
 mean(abs(ase), na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

It is now easy to compute the models’ accuracies:

```
mase(train_data, test_data$count, naive_model)
```

```
## [1] 1.764385
```

```
mase(train_data, test_data$count, croston_model$component$c.out[1])
```

```
## [1] 1.397611
```

```
mase(train_data, test_data$count, nn_model_forecast$mean)
```

```
## [1] 1.767357
```

Croston’s method is the one that performs best from the three. Maybe surprisingly, the naive methodperforms just as well as the Neural Network! (or rather, the AR(1) model) Let’s also plot the predictionswith the true values from the test set:

```
test_data <- test_data %>%
 mutate(naive_model_forecast = naive_model,
 croston_model_forecast = croston_model$component$c.out[1],
 nn_model_forecast = nn_model_forecast$mean) %>%
 select(-package) %>%
 rename(actual_value = count)


test_data_longer <- test_data %>%
 gather(models, value,
 actual_value, naive_model_forecast, croston_model_forecast, nn_model_forecast)
```

```
## Warning: attributes are not identical across measure variables;
## they will be dropped
```

```
ggplot(test_data_longer) +
 geom_line(aes(y = value, x = date, colour = models)) +
 theme_blog()
```

Just to make sure I didn’t make a mistake when writing the `mase()` function, let’s use the`accuracy()` function from the `{forecast}` package and compare the result for the Neural Network:

```
library(forecast)
accuracy(nn_model_forecast, x = test_data$actual_value)
```

```
## ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1
## Training set 0.001929409 14.81196 4.109577 NaN Inf 0.8437033 0.05425074
## Test set 8.211758227 12.40199 8.635563 -Inf Inf 1.7673570 NA
```

The result is the same, so it does seem like the naive method is not that bad, actually! Now, ingeneral, intermittent demand series have a lot of 0 values, which is not really the case here. Istill think that the methodology fits to this particular data set.

How else would you have forecast this data? Let me know via twitter!
