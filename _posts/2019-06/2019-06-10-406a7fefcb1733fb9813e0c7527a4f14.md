*And she’s got brains enough for two, which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need.*

*“I’m not absolutely certain of the facts, but I rather fancy it’s Shakespeare who says that it’s always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping.”*

*“A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life’s gas-pipe with a lighted candle.”*

*“It isn’t often that Aunt Dahlia lets her angry passions rise, but when she does, strong men climb trees and pull them up after them.”*

*“Some minds are like soup in a poor restaurant – better left unstirred.”*

## Introduction

My R package **cricketr** had its genesis about 4 years ago, sometime around June 2015. There were some minor updates afterwards and the package performed analytics on cricketers (Test, ODI and T20) based on data from ESPN Cricinfo see Re-introducing cricketr! : An R package to analyze performances of cricketers. Now, in the latest release of cricketr, I have included 8 functions which can perform Team analytics. Team analysis can be done for Test, ODI and T20 teams.

This package uses the statistics info available in ESPN Cricinfo Statsguru. The current version of this package can handle all formats of the game including Test, ODI and Twenty20 cricket for players (batsmen & bowlers) and also teams (Test, ODI and T20)

You should be able to install the package directly from CRAN. Please be mindful of ESPN Cricinfo Terms of Use

A total of 8 new functions which deal with team analytics has been included in the latest release.

There are 5 functions which are used internally 1) getTeamData b) getTeamNumber c) getMatchType d) getTeamDataHomeAway e) cleanTeamData

and the external functions which area) teamWinLossStatusVsOppositionb) teamWinLossStatusAtGroundsc) plotTimelineofWinsLosses

All the above functions are common to Test, ODI and T20 teams

The data for a particular Team can be obtained with the getTeamDataHomeAway() function from the package. This will return a dataframe of the team’s win/loss status at home and away venues over a period of time. This can be saved as a CSV file. Once this is done, you can use this CSV file for all subsequent analysis

As before you can get the help for any of the cricketr functions as below

## 2 Analysis of Test matches

The functions below perform analysis of Test teams

### 2a. Wins vs Loss against opposition

This function performs analysis of Test teams against other teams at home/away or neutral venue. **Note**:- The opposition can be a vector of opposition teams. Similarly homeOrAway can also be a vector of home/away/neutral venues.

```

df <- teamWinLossStatusVsOpposition("india.csv",teamName="India",opposition=c("all"),homeOrAway=c("all"),matchType="Test",plot=FALSE)
head(df)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
## # Groups: Opposition [3]
## Opposition Result count
## 
## 1 Afghanistan won 1
## 2 Australia draw 43
## 3 Australia lost 84
## 4 Australia tied 2
## 5 Australia won 52
## 6 Bangladesh draw 3
```

```
