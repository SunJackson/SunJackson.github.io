Since the launch of Kernels, one core focus at Kaggle has been to enable robust workflows that can empower tomorrow’s data scientists to do their best work. Today, over 200,000 public scripts and notebooks exist on our platform, showcasing a plethora of remarkable data science projects. We want to help our community take these projects to the next level by extending the possibilities of what can be done in Kernels.

That is why we are excited to announce that, as of today, Kaggle has officially integrated into BigQuery, Google’s enterprise cloud data warehouse. In addition to our Python and R environments in Kernels, this integration opens up a third possibility to execute BigQuery’s renowned, high-performance SQL queries on your massive datasets. Analyzing data is now a faster process using this integration, even on really large datasets. Not to mention, BigQuery has several tiers to support scalable massive data storage and query processing. This integration turns a data scientist’s workflow into a more seamless process instead of the current fragmented practice, where data storage, querying, cleaning, and analysis would take place across several tools and platforms. Now, all of that can happen right inside BigQuery and Kaggle Kernels!

Another unique feature as part of this integration is BigQuery ML. BigQuery ML is a set of extensions to the SQL language that allows one to easily (in minutes) create, train, and evaluate machine learning models and their predictive performance. For those working in or just starting out in data science, this is an incredibly straightforward way to get started with modeling. Overall, machine learning has effectively become more accessible on Kaggle. 

### **Getting started with BigQuery on Kaggle**

The last section of this post consists of a brief tutorial that walks you through a couple options for enabling Google Cloud services and understanding how to use your BigQuery account in the context of this integration. Once you have a BigQuery account and stored a dataset there, head to Kaggle Kernels > “New Kernel” and spin up a new notebook session. Link the dataset to your Kaggle account by clicking “BigQuery” on the right-hand sidebar followed by “Link an account”. Once your account is linked, you can access any datasets stored on your BigQuery account using the BigQuery API Client library.

You can follow a complete How to use BigQuery on Kaggle tutorial. Or, here’s a quick example query using the Ames Housing dataset publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, as well as their final sales price. Let’s compose a query to gain some insights from the data. We want to find out what different home types there are in this dataset, as well as how many do or do not have central air conditioning installed. Here’s how the query looks inside the Kernels IDE:

We quickly get a response showing that one-story homes are the most common home style in Ames and that, regardless of home style, most homes have central air conditioning. There are many more public datasets on Kaggle that you can explore in this way.

### **Building ML models using SQL queries**

Aside from data analysis, BigQuery ML lets you create and evaluate machine learning models using SQL queries. With a few queries, any data scientist can build and evaluate regression models without extensive knowledge of machine learning frameworks or programming languages. Let’s create a linear model that aims to predict the final sales price of real estate in Ames. This model will train on a couple inputs—living area size, year built, overall condition, and overall quality. Here’s the model code:

```
model1 = """
 CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL 
 `my-example-housing-dataset.ameshousing.linearmodel`
 OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', ls_init_learn_rate=.15, l1_reg=1, max_iterations=5) AS
 SELECT 
 IFNULL(SalePrice, 0) AS label,
 IFNULL(GrLivArea, 0) AS LivingAreaSize,
 YearBuilt, 
 OverallCond, 
 OverallQual
 FROM 
 `my-example-housing-dataset.ameshousing.train`
 """

```

In just one query, we’ve created a SQL-based ML model inside Kernels. You could continue using Kernels to create more advanced queries for analysis and optimize your model for better results. You may even choose to publish your Kernel to share publicly with the Kaggle community and broader Internet after your analysis is complete. To see the rest of the workflow on obtaining training statistics and evaluating the model, visit the complete How to use BigQuery on Kaggle tutorial. This tutorial is publicly available as a Kernels notebook. You can also check out the Getting started with BigQuery ML kernel that goes into greater depth on training and evaluating models.

### **Tutorial: Setting up a Google Cloud Platform Account**

To take advantage of this integration, users on Kaggle must enable Google Cloud services for their Google account. If you do not have a Google account, sign up here. It’s important to note that this is Kaggle’s first integration with a service that has both free and paid tier options. 

To use BigQuery for free, we recommend enabling your account under the BigQuery Sandbox, which gives you up to 10GB of free storage, 1 terabyte per month of query processing, and 10GB of BigQuery ML model creation queries. Here are more details on tier pricing in BigQuery’s documentation. It is very easy to sign up for BigQuery Sandbox. Simply navigate to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console here and click on “Sign In” (red circle in image below) to link your Google account. Once you’re signed in, you’re automatically using BigQuery Sandbox! Unless you enter payment information, your account will stay under this free option.

Worth noting, BigQuery also offers a second free option which you can sign up for by clicking on “Try For Free” (yellow circle in image above). After inserting your payment information, you will receive $300 credits for free to spend on Google Cloud over the next 12 months. Learn more about that option here. 

BigQuery’s storage options are appealing to Kaggle users who may have datasets too large to manage on Kaggle. After signing in to the GCP console, click on “BigQuery” in the left-hand sidebar to head to the BigQuery interface. Click “Create Dataset” (green circle in image below) to upload your dataset to BigQuery. Take note to upload your data within the intended project of your choice because you will reference that in Kernels later on. You can create and manage project names in the topbar (blue circle in image below). You can also click “Add Data” (purple circle in image below) and explore over 100 public datasets uploaded by BigQuery.
