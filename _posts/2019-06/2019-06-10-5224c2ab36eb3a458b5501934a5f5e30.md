The latest version of the **salesforcer** package (v0.1.3) is now available on CRANand it is ready to help you better manage your Salesforce data. Along with a hostof bug fixes this release has three big features:

1. Pull lists of deleted and updated records by timeframe and be able to undeletethem or permanently delete them from the Recycle Bin to free up space in your org

1. Search for duplicates using the duplicate rules in your org and merge records

1. Control API call behaviors to perform “All or None” inserts, bypass duplicate rules,configure the transfer of related records when changing a record’s owner, and more


## Pulling Lists of Delete and Updated Records

Salesforce is an organizational tool and with many hands touching the system sometimesyou are called in to do some detective work to figure out which records have beendeleted or updated in your org. Luckily, Salesforce has your back. Their SOAP API hastwo methods that will return the deleted or updated records within a timeframe. Thosetwo methods have been implemented in **salesforcer** 0.1.3 as `sf_get_deleted()` and`sf_get_updated()`. Here is an example pulling out anything deleted yesterday:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# if no timezone is provided UTC is assumed
deleted_recs <- sf_get_deleted("Contact", start = Sys.Date() - 1, end = Sys.Date())
# here is how to pull deleted using yesterday according to EDT with help from lubridate
deleted_recs <- sf_get_deleted("Contact", 
 start = ymd(Sys.Date()-1, tz="America/New_York"), 
 end = ymd(Sys.Date(), tz="America/New_York"))
deleted_recs
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,838 x 2
## deletedDate id 
## 
## 1 2019-06-09 14:54:55 0036A00000kHn3DQAS
## 2 2019-06-09 14:54:56 0036A00000kHu13QAC
## 3 2019-06-09 14:54:56 0036A00000kHu9RQAS
## 4 2019-06-09 14:54:55 0036A00000kHn4VQAS
## 5 2019-06-09 14:54:55 0036A00000kHn4WQAS
## 6 2019-06-09 14:54:56 0036A00000kHuAyQAK
## 7 2019-06-09 14:54:56 0036A00000kHuAzQAK
## 8 2019-06-09 14:54:55 0036A00000kHnAnQAK
## 9 2019-06-09 14:54:56 0036A00000kHu0FQAS
## 10 2019-06-09 14:54:56 0036A00000kHu1wQAC
## # … with 1,828 more rows
```

Now if you see records in there that you may want back, now it’s as simple as callingthe `sf_undelete()` function with the ids of the records you want.

```
# undelete the first three records from the list of records deleted yesterday 
undeleted <- sf_undelete(deleted_recs$id[1:3])
undeleted
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
## id success
## 
## 1 0036A00000kHn3DQAS TRUE 
## 2 0036A00000kHu13QAC TRUE 
## 3 0036A00000kHu9RQAS TRUE
```

You can double check that the records are actually no longer deleted by running aquery for them and checking the `IsDeleted` field like this:

```
# check that the first three records are no longer deleted 
is_not_deleted <- sf_query(sprintf("SELECT Id, IsDeleted 
 FROM Contact 
 WHERE Id IN ('%s')", 
 paste0(undeleted$id, collapse="','")))
is_not_deleted
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
## Id IsDeleted
## 
## 1 0036A00000kHn3DQAS FALSE 
## 2 0036A00000kHu13QAC FALSE 
## 3 0036A00000kHu9RQAS FALSE
```

Now let’s say you really do want them deleted and by that, I mean permanentlyfrom your org so they do not count against your space quota. Now you can emptyitems in your Recycle Bin. Here is an example where we delete the records we justundeleted and then empty them from the Recycle Bin.

```
# delete the records to move them to the Recycle Bin, them empty them from it
deleted <- sf_delete(is_not_deleted$Id)
really_deleted <- sf_empty_recycle_bin(deleted$id)
really_deleted
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
## id success
## 
## 1 0036A00000kHn3DQAS TRUE 
## 2 0036A00000kHu13QAC TRUE 
## 3 0036A00000kHu9RQAS TRUE
```

If you want to double-check the field values of a deleted record, just make sure toset `queryall = TRUE` in your query so that it returns deleted or archived records in theresultset. Note that after records are deleted from the Recycle Bin using this call,they can be queried using `queryall = TRUE` for some time. Typically this time is24 hours, but may be shorter or longer.

```
# permanently deleted records not there in regular query
not_visible <- sf_query(sprintf("SELECT Id, IsDeleted 
 FROM Contact 
 WHERE Id IN ('%s')", 
 paste0(really_deleted$id, collapse="','")))
not_visible
```

```
## # A tibble: 0 x 0
```

```
# but still there if using queryall for ~24 hrs
still_visible <- sf_query(sprintf("SELECT Id, IsDeleted 
 FROM Contact 
 WHERE Id IN ('%s')", 
 paste0(really_deleted$id, collapse="','")), 
 queryall = TRUE)
still_visible
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
## Id IsDeleted
## 
## 1 0036A00000kHn3DQAS TRUE 
## 2 0036A00000kHu13QAC TRUE 
## 3 0036A00000kHu9RQAS TRUE
```

## Searching for Duplicates and Merging Them

Part of having a Salesforce instance means maintaining a high-level of data integrity.That means not allowing duplicates to crop up and, if they do, merging and deletingthem quickly so that any activity with a record can be tracked in a single place.In **salesforcer** 0.1.3 you can find duplicates using the Duplicate Rules already inplace in your org. In the example below I will create three records with the sameemail address. I’ve already set up a Duplicate Rule in my org to recognize and preventrecords from being creating if they have the same email address as another record alreadyin Salesforce. When I run `sf_find_duplicates()` it finds all three records.

```
# create the records 
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Rick", 3), 
 LastName = rep("James", 3), 
 Email = rep("[email protected]", 3),
 Description = c("Musician", "Funk Legend", NA))
new_contacts
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 4
## FirstName LastName Email Description
## 
## 1 Rick James [email protected] Musician 
## 2 Rick James [email protected] Funk Legend
## 3 Rick James [email protected] 
```

```
# insert the records
new_recs <- sf_create(new_contacts, "Contact", 
 DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = TRUE,
 includeRecordDetails = FALSE,
 runAsCurrentUser = TRUE))
new_recs
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
## id success
## 
## 1 0036A00000wzoYQQAY TRUE 
## 2 0036A00000wzoYRQAY TRUE 
## 3 0036A00000wzoYSQAY TRUE
```

```
# find them as dupes
dupes_found <- sf_find_duplicates(search_criteria = list(Email = "[email protected]"),
 object_name = "Contact")
```

```
## Using Contact rules: Standard_Rule_for_Contacts_with_Duplicate_Leads, Contact_Dupe_Email
```

```
dupes_found
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
## sObject Id 
## 
## 1 Contact 0036A00000wzoYQQAY
## 2 Contact 0036A00000wzoYRQAY
## 3 Contact 0036A00000wzoYSQAY
```

The recordset from `sf_find_duplicates()` shows the object that the records were found inand their Ids. You will notice that those are the same Ids as what we received back whencreating the records to verify that we found those same three records based on the duplicatedemail address. You will also notice in the call that there is a message showing whichrules were executed when searching for duplicates, one of them being a custom matching ruleI created called `Contact_Dupe_Email`. In order for this function to work you musthave Duplicate Rules configured in your system. There is a lot of good documentationonline about how to set up these rules. Here is a link to one Salesforce Trailhead articlethat I like: Resolve and Prevent Duplicate Data.

Now if I’d like to merge those three duplicates records into one I can do so usingthe new `sf_merge()` function. I need to pick one of the records as the `master record`and supply its Id to the function. The other records’ Ids will be the `victim_ids`.All of the fields on the master record will supercede the others, but if you wouldlike to override some of those fields, then just specify them in the `master_fields`argument. In this example, we are merging the second and third record into the firstrecord. However, I like the description “Funk Legend” from the second record to beon the master record, so I just specify it in the `master_fields` argument.

```
merge_summary <- sf_merge(master_id = dupes_found$Id[1], 
 victim_ids = dupes_found$Id[2:3], 
 object_name = "Contact",
 master_fields = c("Description" = "Funk Legend"))
merge_summary
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 5
## id success mergedRecordIds updatedRelatedIds errors
## 
## 1 0036A00000wzoYQQAY TRUE NA NA
```

You can check that the other two records that were merged into the master record havenow been deleted and that they are tagged in the `MasterRecordId` field with the Idof the master record they were merged into.

```
merge_confirm <- sf_query(sprintf("SELECT Id, MasterRecordId, IsDeleted 
 FROM Contact 
 WHERE Id IN ('%s')", 
 paste0(dupes_found$Id, collapse="','")), 
 queryall = TRUE)
merge_confirm
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
## Id MasterRecordId IsDeleted
## 
## 1 0036A00000wzoYQQAY FALSE 
## 2 0036A00000wzoYRQAY 0036A00000wzoYQQAY TRUE 
## 3 0036A00000wzoYSQAY 0036A00000wzoYQQAY TRUE
```

## Controlling API Call Behavior

You may have noticed an argument called `all_or_none` in the previous CRAN releaseof **salesforcer**. This argument is put into the header of the API call so that whenrecords are created/updated/deleted it will only complete if all records were successful,otherwise all of the record changes are rolled back. This “All or None” behavior is justone of over a dozen headers that the SOAP API accepts. The REST, Bulk, and Metadata APIsalso have their own headers which can be set. You can pass these controls into **salesforcer**functions directly or by setting the `control` argument that now appears in many functions.For example, if you are inserting records and would like to bypass the Duplicate Rulesin your org, then set the DuplicateRuleHeader) like this:

```
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", 2),
 LastName = rep("Contact", 2), 
 Email = rep("[email protected]", 2))

# add control to allow the creation of records that violate a duplicate email rule
new_recs <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name = "Contact", 
 DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = TRUE,
 includeRecordDetails = FALSE,
 runAsCurrentUser = TRUE))
new_recs
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
## id success
## 
## 1 0036A00000wzoYaQAI TRUE 
## 2 0036A00000wzoYbQAI TRUE
```

In the documentation you may notice that the control argument in the `sf_create()` function definitionlooks like this `control = list(...)`. This allows you to include the control headersas an argument right in the function or put them inside the `sf_control` function.An example of using the `sf_control()` function looks like this:

```
new_recs <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name = "Contact", 
 control=sf_control(DuplicateRuleHeader=list(allowSave=TRUE,
 includeRecordDetails=FALSE,
 runAsCurrentUser=TRUE)))
new_recs
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
## id success
## 
## 1 0036A00000wzoYkQAI TRUE 
## 2 0036A00000wzoYlQAI TRUE
```

The `sf_control()` function works exactly like `glm.control()` when using the `glm()`function in the **stats** package. It will accept any of the extra arguments in thefunction call and validate them to see if they are accepted by the API type and operationthat the function is performing. As mentioned before, there are over a dozen controlparameters that are now possible across the various APIs. Those are documented on thepkgdown website’s documentation for `sf_control()`.There is also a vignette which describes all of this in more detail at Passing Control Args.
