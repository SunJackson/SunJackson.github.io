**Improving Background Based Conversation with Context-aware Knowledge Pre-selection**

Background Based Conversations (BBCs) have been developed to make dialogue systems generate more informative and natural responses by leveraging background knowledge. Existing methods for BBCs can be grouped into two categories: extraction-based methods and generation-based methods. The former extract spans frombackground material as responses that are not necessarily natural. The latter generate responses thatare natural but not necessarily effective in leveraging background knowledge. In this paper, we focus on generation-based methods and propose a model, namely Context-aware Knowledge Pre-selection (CaKe), which introduces a pre-selection process that uses dynamic bi-directional attention to improve knowledge selection by using the utterance history context as prior information to select the most relevant background material. Experimental results show that our model is superior to current state-of-the-art baselines, indicating that it benefits from the pre-selection process, thus improving in-formativeness and fluency.

**Ensemble Consider Kalman Filtering**

In this paper, the ensemble consider Kalman filter is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of uncertain parameters in nonlinear dynamic and measurement models. The ensemble Kalman filter can avoid using the Jacobian matrices and reduce the computational complexity, the unknown parameters of the models still are not considered. By incorporating the statistics of the uncertain parameters into the state estimation formulations and using an augmented-state approach, the ensemble integration is reset by resampling the ensemble members in the new step, and the EnCKF algorithm is derived. Two numerical simulations show that the presented EnCKF can mitigate the negative effects of the uncertain parameters.

**MoËT: Interpretable and Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Mixture of Expert Trees**

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has led to many recent breakthroughs on complex control tasks, such as defeating the best human player in the game of Go. However, decisions made by the DRL agent are not explainable, hindering its applicability in safety-critical settings. Viper, a recently proposed technique, constructs a decision tree policy by mimicking the DRL agent. Decision trees are interpretable as each action made can be traced back to the decision rule path that lead to it. However, one global decision tree approximating the DRL policy has significant limitations with respect to the geometry of decision boundaries. We propose Mo\’ET, a more expressive, yet still interpretable model based on Mixture of Experts, consisting of a gating function that partitions the state space, and multiple decision tree experts that specialize on different partitions. We propose a training procedure to support non-differentiable decision tree experts and integrate it into imitation learning procedure of Viper. We evaluate our algorithm on four OpenAI gym environments, and show that the policy constructed in such a way is more performant and better mimics the DRL agent by lowering mispredictions and increasing the reward. We also show that Mo\’ET policies are amenable for verification using off-the-shelf automated theorem provers such as Z3.

**ConTrOn: Continuously Trained Ontology based on Technical Data Sheets and Wikidata**

In engineering projects involving various parts from global suppliers, one common task is to determine which parts are best suited for the project requirements. Information about specific parts’ characteristics is published in so called data sheets. However, these data sheets are oftentimes only published in textual form, e.g., as a PDF. Hence, they have to be transformed into a machine-interpretable format. This transformation process still requires a lot of manual intervention and is prone to errors. Automated approaches make use of ontologies to capture the given domain and thus improve automated information extraction from the data sheets. However, ontologies rely solely on experiences and perspectives of their creators at the time of creation and cannot accumulate knowledge over time on their own. This paper presents ConTrOn — Continuously Trained Ontology — a system that automatically augments ontologies. ConTrOn tackles terminology problems by combining the knowledge extracted from data sheets with an ontology created by domain experts and external knowledge bases such as WordNet and Wikidata. To demonstrate how the enriched ontology can improve the information extraction process, we selected data sheets from spacecraft development as a use case. The evaluation results show that the amount of information extracted from data sheets based on ontologies is significantly increased after the ontology enrichment.

**A Survey of Optimization Methods from a Machine Learning Perspective**

Machine learning develops rapidly, which has made many theoretical breakthroughs and is widely applied in various fields. Optimization, as an important part of machine learning, has attracted much attention of researchers. With the exponential growth of data amount and the increase of model complexity, optimization methods in machine learning face more and more challenges. A lot of work on solving optimization problems or improving optimization methods in machine learning has been proposed successively. The systematic retrospect and summary of the optimization methods from the perspective of machine learning are of great significance, which can offer guidance for both developments of optimization and machine learning research. In this paper, we first describe the optimization problems in machine learning. Then, we introduce the principles and progresses of commonly used optimization methods. Next, we summarize the applications and developments of optimization methods in some popular machine learning fields. Finally, we explore and give some challenges and open problems for the optimization in machine learning.

**Homogeneous Network Embedding for Massive Graphs via Personalized PageRank**

Given an input graph G and a node v in G, homogeneous network embedding (HNE) aims to map the graph structure in the vicinity of v to a fixed-dimensional feature vector. Such feature vectors can then be fed to a machine learning pipeline as inputs, e.g., for link prediction. The vast majority of existing approaches to HNE are immensely expensive, and, thus, are limited to small graphs. The few that do scale to large graphs, on the other hand, are based on quick-and-rough heuristics that fail to fully capture the local graph structure, leading to limited effectiveness of the extracted feature vectors. Meanwhile, in recent years there have been rapid advancements in scalable algorithms for computing approximate personalized PageRank (PPR), which captures rich graph topological information. A natural idea is: can we construct an effective embedding of a node v based on its approximate PPR values? This turns out to be challenging, due to the fact that PPR was designed for a very different purpose, i.e., ranking nodes in the graph based on their relative importance from an individual node v’s perspective. In contrast, in HNE the goal is to build unified node embeddings for all nodes from a global view. Consequently, using PPR values directly as node embeddings leads to sub-optimal result effectiveness. Motivated by this, we propose Node-Reweighted PageRank (NRP), a novel solution that transforms personalized PageRank values into effective node embeddings, by iteratively solving an optimization problem. NRP computation is efficient and scalable: in particular, NRP embeddings for a billion-edge graph can be computed in a few hours on a single CPU core. At the same time, the quality of NRP embeddings is highly competitive: as our experiments demonstrate, in terms of prediction accuracy, NRP consistently outperforms existing HNE methods on 3 graph analysis tasks, on both large and small graphs.

**Predicting Research Trends with Semantic and Neural Networks with an application in Quantum Physics**

The vast and growing number of publications in all disciplines of science cannot be comprehended by a single human researcher. As a consequence, researchers have to specialize in narrow sub-disciplines, which makes it challenging to uncover scientific connections beyond the own field of research. Thus access to structured knowledge from a large corpus of publications could help pushing the frontiers of science. Here we demonstrate a method to build a semantic network from published scientific literature, which we call SemNet. We use SemNet to predict future trends in research and to inspire new, personalized and surprising seeds of ideas in science. We apply it in the discipline of quantum physics, which has seen an unprecedented growth of activity in recent years. In SemNet, scientific knowledge is represented as an evolving network using the content of 750,000 scientific papers published since 1919. The nodes of the network correspond to physical concepts, and links between two nodes are drawn when two physical concepts are concurrently studied in research articles. We identify influential and prize-winning research topics from the past inside SemNet thus confirm that it stores useful semantic knowledge. We train a deep neural network using states of SemNet of the past, to predict future developments in quantum physics research, and confirm high quality predictions using historic data. With the neural network and theoretical network tools we are able to suggest new, personalized, out-of-the-box ideas, by identifying pairs of concepts which have unique and extremal semantic network properties. Finally, we consider possible future developments and implications of our findings.

**Structured Pruning of Recurrent Neural Networks through Neuron Selection**

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently achieved remarkable successes in a number of applications. However, the huge sizes and computational burden of these models make it difficult for their deployment on edge devices. A practically effective approach is to reduce the overall storage and computation costs of RNNs by network pruning techniques. Despite their successful applications, those pruning methods based on Lasso either produce irregular sparse patterns in weight matrices, which is not helpful in practical speedup. To address these issues, we propose structured pruning method through neuron selection which can reduce the sizes of basic structures of RNNs. More specifically, we introduce two sets of binary random variables, which can be interpreted as gates or switches to the input neurons and the hidden neurons, respectively. We demonstrate that the corresponding optimization problem can be addressed by minimizing the L0 norm of the weight matrix. Finally, experimental results on language modeling and machine reading comprehension tasks have indicated the advantages of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art pruning competitors. In particular, nearly 20 x practical speedup during inference was achieved without losing performance for language model on the Penn TreeBank dataset, indicating the promising performance of the proposed method

**Learning Interpretable Models Using an Oracle**

As Machine Learning (ML) becomes pervasive in various real world systems, the need for models to be interpretable or explainable has increased. We focus on interpretability, noting that models often need to be constrained in size for them to be considered understandable, e.g., a decision tree of depth 5 is easier to interpret than one of depth 50. This suggests a trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. We propose a technique to minimize this tradeoff. Our strategy is to first learn a powerful, possibly black-box, probabilistic model on the data, which we refer to as the oracle. We use this to adaptively sample the training dataset to present data to our model of interest to learn from. Determining the sampling strategy is formulated as an optimization problem that, independent of the dimensionality of the data, uses only seven variables. We empirically show that this often significantly increases the accuracy of our model. Our technique is model agnostic – in that, both the interpretable model and the oracle might come from any model family. Results using multiple real world datasets, using Linear Probability Models and Decision Trees as interpretable models, and Gradient Boosted Model and Random Forest as oracles are presented. Additionally, we discuss an interesting example of using a sentence-embedding based text classifier as an oracle to improve the accuracy of a term-frequency based bag-of-words linear classifier.

**MixUp as Directional Adversarial Training**

In this work, we explain the working mechanism of MixUp in terms of adversarial training. We introduce a new class of adversarial training schemes, which we refer to as directional adversarial training, or DAT. In a nutshell, a DAT scheme perturbs a training example in the direction of another example but keeps its original label as the training target. We prove that MixUp is equivalent to a special subclass of DAT, in that it has the same expected loss function and corresponds to the same optimization problem asymptotically. This understanding not only serves to explain the effectiveness of MixUp, but also reveals a more general family of MixUp schemes, which we call Untied MixUp. We prove that the family of Untied MixUp schemes is equivalent to the entire class of DAT schemes. We establish empirically the existence of Untied Mixup schemes which improve upon MixUp.

**A Provably Correct and Robust Algorithm for Convolutive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization**

In this paper, we propose a provably correct algorithm for convolutive nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) under separability assumptions. CNMF is a convolutive variant of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which functions as an NMF with additional sequential structure. This model is useful in a number of applications, such as audio source separation and neural sequence identification. While a number of heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve CNMF, to the best of our knowledge no provably correct algorithms have been developed. We present an algorithm that takes advantage of the NMF model underlying CNMF and exploits existing algorithms for separable NMF to provably find a solution under certain conditions. Our approach guarantees the solution in low noise settings, and runs in polynomial time. We illustrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets, and on a singing bird audio sequence.

**Normalizing flows for novelty detection in industrial time series data**

Flow-based deep generative models learn data distributions by transforming a simple base distribution into a complex distribution via a set of invertible transformations. Due to the invertibility, such models can score unseen data samples by computing their exact likelihood under the learned distribution. This makes flow-based models a perfect tool for novelty detection, an anomaly detection technique where unseen data samples are classified as normal or abnormal by scoring them against a learned model of normal data. We show that normalizing flows can be used as novelty detectors in time series. Two flow-based models, Masked Autoregressive Flows and Free-form Jacobian of Reversible Dynamics restricted by autoregressive MADE networks, are tested on synthetic data and motor current data from an industrial machine and achieve good results, outperforming a conventional novelty detection method, the Local Outlier Factor.

**Context-aware Embedding for Targeted Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis**

Attention-based neural models were employed to detect the different aspects and sentiment polarities of the same target in targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis (TABSA). However, existing methods do not specifically pre-train reasonable embeddings for targets and aspects in TABSA. This may result in targets or aspects having the same vector representations in different contexts and losing the context-dependent information. To address this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the embeddings of targets and aspects. Such pivotal embedding refinement utilizes a sparse coefficient vector to adjust the embeddings of target and aspect from the context. Hence the embeddings of targets and aspects can be refined from the highly correlative words instead of using context-independent or randomly initialized vectors. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields the state-of-the-art performance in TABSA task.

**The Attack Generator: A Systematic Approach Towards Constructing Adversarial Attacks**

Most state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. As a consequence, adversarial robustness poses a significant challenge for the deployment of ML-based systems in safety- and security-critical environments like autonomous driving, disease detection or unmanned aerial vehicles. In the past years we have seen an impressive amount of publications presenting more and more new adversarial attacks. However, the attack research seems to be rather unstructured and new attacks often appear to be random selections from the unlimited set of possible adversarial attacks. With this publication, we present a structured analysis of the adversarial attack creation process. By detecting different building blocks of adversarial attacks, we outline the road to new sets of adversarial attacks. We call this the ‘attack generator’. In the pursuit of this objective, we summarize and extend existing adversarial perturbation taxonomies. The resulting taxonomy is then linked to the application context of computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles, i.e. semantic segmentation and object detection. Finally, in order to prove the usefulness of the attack generator, we investigate existing semantic segmentation attacks with respect to the detected defining components of adversarial attacks.

**Boosting Supervision with Self-Supervision for Few-shot Learning**

We present a technique to improve the transferability of deep representations learned on small labeled datasets by introducing self-supervised tasks as auxiliary loss functions. While recent approaches for self-supervised learning have shown the benefits of training on large unlabeled datasets, we find improvements in generalization even on small datasets and when combined with strong supervision. Learning representations with self-supervised losses reduces the relative error rate of a state-of-the-art meta-learner by 5-25% on several few-shot learning benchmarks, as well as off-the-shelf deep networks on standard classification tasks when training from scratch. We find the benefits of self-supervision increase with the difficulty of the task. Our approach utilizes the images within the dataset to construct self-supervised losses and hence is an effective way of learning transferable representations without relying on any external training data.

**Coupling Retrieval and Meta-Learning for Context-Dependent Semantic Parsing**

In this paper, we present an approach to incorporate retrieved datapoints as supporting evidence for context-dependent semantic parsing, such as generating source code conditioned on the class environment. Our approach naturally combines a retrieval model and a meta-learner, where the former learns to find similar datapoints from the training data, and the latter considers retrieved datapoints as a pseudo task for fast adaptation. Specifically, our retriever is a context-aware encoder-decoder model with a latent variable which takes context environment into consideration, and our meta-learner learns to utilize retrieved datapoints in a model-agnostic meta-learning paradigm for fast adaptation. We conduct experiments on CONCODE and CSQA datasets, where the context refers to class environment in JAVA codes and conversational history, respectively. We use sequence-to-action model as the base semantic parser, which performs the state-of-the-art accuracy on both datasets. Results show that both the context-aware retriever and the meta-learning strategy improve accuracy, and our approach performs better than retrieve-and-edit baselines.
