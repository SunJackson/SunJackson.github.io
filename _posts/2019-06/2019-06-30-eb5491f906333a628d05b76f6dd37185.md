In the R parallel package, there are two implementations of parallelism, e.g. fork and socket, with pros and cons. 

For the fork, each parallel thread is a complete duplication of the master process with the shared environment, including objects or variables defined prior to the kickoff of parallel threads. Therefore, it runs fast. However, the major limitation is that the fork doesn’t work on the Windows system. 

On the other hand, the socket works on all operating systems. Each thread runs separately without sharing objects or variables, which can only be passed from the master process explicitly. As a result, it runs slower due to the communication overhead. 

Below is an example showing the performance difference between the fork and the socket. A self-defined filter function runs in parallel and exacts three rows out of 336,776 that are meeting criteria. As shown, the fork runs 40% faster than the socket.
