**The Opportunity**

Monash University is honoured to be the first Australian university to receive a licence to operate in China, one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, via the partnership at Suzhou with the Southeast University (SEU), one of China’s key national universities as well as establishment of Monash Suzhou. The SEU-Monash partnership consists of the Joint Research Institute (JRI) and the Joint Graduate School (JGS), and will produce postgraduates and researchers with ideas to change people’s lives in the region and the world for the better.

The JRI conducts multi-disciplinary research projects in areas of strategic importance to industry in Australia and China. To facilitate the collaboration, Monash established The Monash Suzhou Science and Technology Research Institute (MSSTRI) and currently has five priority research themes that address strategic issues of mutual interest, including:

Advanced computation in science and engineering;
Advanced materials and manufacturing;
Energy and environment;
Future cities; and
Life sciences

We are seeking an individual passionate about undertaking research in an area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as multidisciplinary research through the application of AI to problems in one or more of the five research themes above.
