The first is Sunday afternon during the Industry Expo day. This one is meant to be quite practical, starting with an overview of Contextual Bandits and leading into how to apply the new Personalizer service, the first service in the world functionally supporting general contextual bandit learning. 

The second is Friday morning. This one is more academic with many topics. I’ll personally be discussing research questions for real world RL. 

The third one is Friday afternoon with more emphasis on sequences of decisions. I expect to here “imitation learning” multiple times ![](http://hunch.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)


I’m planning to attend all 3. It’s great to see interest building in this direction, because Real World RL seems like the most promising direction for fruitfully expanding the scope of solvable machine learning problems.
