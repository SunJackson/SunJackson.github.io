(TL;DR: matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers.)

Lasttime,we learnt about **dot products**. We will now finally start talkingaobut **matrices**.

We know what row vectors and column vectors are from our previous posts.

What would it look like if we were to stack a bunch of row vectors ontop of each other? Similarly, what would it look like if we were to put abunch of column vectors next to each other? Let’s experiment!

Let’s define some row vectors:





Let’s stack them on top of each other:


This rectangular array of numbers is an example of a **matrix**!

Let’s repeat the exercise with the same vectors represented as columnvectors:





Putting these column vectors next to each other gives us this:


Looks like another matrix to me!

In fact, our row vectors and column vectors we saw in previous postslive double lives. A row vector goes by another name: **“row matrix”**.A column vector goes by another name, too: **“column matrix”**.

Sneaky!

As before, we will be following the notation used in *Goodfellow, Ian,et al.*. We willdepict matrices using uppercase, bold font:



From the above, we can guess that matrices can be described in terms of**rows and columns**. How can we describe the **number of rows and thenumber of columns** we have in our matrices?

Let’s go back to our previous examples. They both happen to have *threerows* and *three columns*. So we have ourselves two *3 x 3 (“three bythree”) matrices*. **The number of rows and the number of columnsdescribe the “size” of our matrix.**

Let’s generalise this. By convention, we have rows and columnsin our matrix. Let’s use our matrix as an example. Wehaven’t defined what elements it contains. In fact, all we have said isthat is a matrix. Whatever the contents of, it will will have rows and columns. Sowill be of size .

Let’s take this a step further. From previous posts, we are working with**real numbers** so let’s assume that our matrix ofsize will contain real numbers. That is, it is a **realmatrix**. How can we depict this using some compact notation?

Remember when we touched on our vectors belonging to some abstract**set** of all real-valued vectors of **similar dimensions** when describing the dimensions of avector?We can say something similar for our real-valued matrix of size. We can describe this set of all real-valued matrices like this:


So to show that our matrix belongs to the set of allmatrices that are made up of real numbers, we simply say:


Going back to our examples above:

- Our real-valued row vectors (a.k.a. **row matrices**) are members ofthe set . That is, they are members of theset of all possible matrices made up of one row and columns ofreal numbers.

- Our real-valued column vectors (a.k.a. **column matrices**) aremembers of the set . That is, they aremembers of the set of all possible matrices made up of rows and one column of real numbers.

- Our real-valued square matrices are members of the setwhere . That is, they are membersof the set of all possible real matrices that have the same numberof rows as they have columns.


Not too bad, right?

## Stack those vectors

One way is to simply `rbind` and `cbind` vectors. Let’s define 3 vectorsand `rbind` them (i.e. stack them row-wise):

```
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
c <- c(7, 8, 9)

A <- rbind(a, b, c)

print(A)

```

```
## [,1] [,2] [,3]
## a 1 2 3
## b 4 5 6
## c 7 8 9

```

We have ourselves a matrix!

Let’s now stack them column-wise by using `cbind` on our vectors:

```
A <- cbind(a, b, c)

print(A)

```

```
## a b c
## [1,] 1 4 7
## [2,] 2 5 8
## [3,] 3 6 9

```

It’s a matrix!

## Use the `matrix` function

The “usual” way to create a matrix would be to pass some vector or listinto the `matrix` function and specify its dimensions. For example, if wewant to use the values passed into the `matrix` function to create a 3×3 matrix by using the values in a **column-wise** manner, we can do this:

```
matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol=3)

```

```
## [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,] 1 4 7
## [2,] 2 5 8
## [3,] 3 6 9

```

If instead we want to use the numbers in a **row-wise** manner, then wecan use the `byrow` argument and set it to `TRUE`:

```
matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

```

```
## [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,] 1 2 3
## [2,] 4 5 6
## [3,] 7 8 9

```

The data types of the elements in the vector or list you pass into the`matrix` function will be coerced to a single data type following theusual coercion rules. For example, if we use a vector containing a`numeric` type and a `integer` type, let’s see what happens:

```
our_vec <- c(1.0, 1L)
A <- matrix(our_vec, nrow=2, ncol=1)

print(A)

```

```
## [,1]
## [1,] 1
## [2,] 1

```

From previous posts, we know that the values in our vector have alreadybeen coerced by `c` before the `matrix` function sees them! So,naturally, we have a matrix of `numeric` types:

```
## [1] "numeric" "numeric"

```

We can even have a character matrix. Not sure why we’d want to createone…but we can!

```
x <- c("hello", "goodbye")
matrix(x)

```

```
## [,1] 
## [1,] "hello" 
## [2,] "goodbye"

```

## Elements are recycled

Recycling occurs like in vector addition posts. For example, if we try tocreate a matrix with four elements (2 rows times 2 columns) from avector with only two elements, this is what we get:

```
matrix(c(1, 2), nrow=2, ncol=2)

```

```
## [,1] [,2]
## [1,] 1 1
## [2,] 2 2

```

If the number of elements in our vector is not a multiple or submultipleof the number of rows or columns, we get warned of this fact:

```
matrix(c(1, 2, 3), nrow=2, ncol=1)

```

```
## Warning in matrix(c(1, 2, 3), nrow = 2, ncol = 1): data length [3] is not a
## sub-multiple or multiple of the number of rows [2]

## [,1]
## [1,] 1
## [2,] 2

```

Done!

Next time, we’ll talk about matrix addition and introduce some notation we can use to access the individual elements contained within our matrices!
