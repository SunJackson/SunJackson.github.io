**Highly Scalable and Flexible Model for Effective Aggregation of Context-based Data in Generic IIoT Scenarios**

Interconnectivity of production machines is a key feature of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This feature allows for many advantages in producing. Configuration and maintenance gets easier, as access to the given production unit is not necessarily coupled to physical presence. Customized production of goods is easily possible, reducing production times and increasing throughput. There are, however, also dangers to the increasing talkativeness of industrial production machines. The more open a system is, the more points of entry for an attacker exist. Furthermore, the amount of data a production site also increases rapidly due to the integrated intelligence and interconnectivity. To keep track of this data in order to detect attacks and errors in the production site, it is necessary to smartly aggregate and evaluate the data. In this paper, we present a new approach for collecting, aggregating and analysing data from different sources and on three different levels of abstraction. Our model is event-centric, considering every occurrence of information inside the system as an event. In the lowest level of abstraction, singular packets are collected, correlated with log-entries and analysed. On the highest level of abstraction, networks are pictured as a connectivity graph, enriched with information about host-based activities. Furthermore, we describe our work in progress of evaluating our aggregation model on two different system settings. In the first scenario, we verify the usability of our model in a remote maintenance application. In the second scenario, we evaluate our model in the context of network sniffing and correlation with log-files. First results show that our model is a promising solution to cope with increasing amounts of data and to correlate information from different types of sources.

**Representing and Using Knowledge with the Contextual Evaluation Model**

This paper introduces the Contextual Evaluation Model (CEM), a novel method for knowledge representation and manipulation. The CEM differs from existing models in that it integrates facts, patterns and sequences into a single contextual framework. V5, an implementation of the model is presented and demonstrated with multiple annotated examples. The paper includes simulations demonstrating how the model reacts to pleasure/pain stimuli. The ‘thought’ is defined within the model and examples are given converting thoughts to language, converting language to thoughts and how ‘meaning’ arises from thoughts. A pattern learning algorithm is described. The algorithm is applied to multiple problems ranging from recognizing a voice to the autonomous learning of a simplified natural language.

**Unsupervised and Supervised Principal Component Analysis: Tutorial**

This is a detailed tutorial paper which explains the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Supervised PCA (SPCA), kernel PCA, and kernel SPCA. We start with projection, PCA with eigen-decomposition, PCA with one and multiple projection directions, properties of the projection matrix, reconstruction error minimization, and we connect to auto-encoder. Then, PCA with singular value decomposition, dual PCA, and kernel PCA are covered. SPCA using both scoring and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion are explained. Kernel SPCA using both direct and dual approaches are then introduced. We cover all cases of projection and reconstruction of training and out-of-sample data. Finally, some simulations are provided on Frey and AT&T face datasets for verifying the theory in practice.

**An Analysis of Emotion Communication Channels in Fan Fiction: Towards Emotional Storytelling**

Centrality of emotion for the stories told by humans is underpinned by numerous studies in literature and psychology. The research in automatic storytelling has recently turned towards emotional storytelling, in which characters’ emotions play an important role in the plot development. However, these studies mainly use emotion to generate propositional statements in the form ‘A feels affection towards B’ or ‘A confronts B’. At the same time, emotional behavior does not boil down to such propositional descriptions, as humans display complex and highly variable patterns in communicating their emotions, both verbally and non-verbally. In this paper, we analyze how emotions are expressed non-verbally in a corpus of fan fiction short stories. Our analysis shows that stories written by humans convey character emotions along various non-verbal channels. We find that some non-verbal channels, such as facial expressions and voice characteristics of the characters, are more strongly associated with joy, while gestures and body postures are more likely to occur with trust. Based on our analysis, we argue that automatic storytelling systems should take variability of emotion into account when generating descriptions of characters’ emotions.

**StyleNAS: An Empirical Study of Neural Architecture Search to Uncover Surprisingly Fast End-to-End Universal Style Transfer Networks**

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely studied for designing discriminative deep learning models such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. As a large number of priors have been obtained through the manual design of architectures in the fields, NAS is usually considered as a supplement approach. In this paper, we have significantly expanded the application areas of NAS by performing an empirical study of NAS to search generative models, or specifically, auto-encoder based universal style transfer, which lacks systematic exploration, if any, from the architecture search aspect. In our work, we first designed a search space where common operators for image style transfer such as VGG-based encoders, whitening and coloring transforms (WCT), convolution kernels, instance normalization operators, and skip connections were searched in a combinatorial approach. With a simple yet effective parallel evolutionary NAS algorithm with multiple objectives, we derived the first group of end-to-end deep networks for universal photorealistic style transfer. Comparing to random search, a NAS method that is gaining popularity recently, we demonstrated that carefully designed search strategy leads to much better architecture design. Finally compared to existing universal style transfer networks for photorealistic rendering such as PhotoWCT that stacks multiple well-trained auto-encoders and WCT transforms in a non-end-to-end manner, the architectures designed by StyleNAS produce better style-transferred images with details preserving, using a tiny number of operators/parameters, and enjoying around 500x inference time speed-up.

**Covariance in Physics and Convolutional Neural Networks**

In this proceeding we give an overview of the idea of covariance (or equivariance) featured in the recent development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We study the similarities and differences between the use of covariance in theoretical physics and in the CNN context. Additionally, we demonstrate that the simple assumption of covariance, together with the required properties of locality, linearity and weight sharing, is sufficient to uniquely determine the form of the convolution.

**Practical Deep Learning with Bayesian Principles**

Bayesian methods promise to fix many shortcomings of deep learning, but they are impractical and rarely match the performance of standard methods, let alone improve them. In this paper, we demonstrate practical training of deep networks with natural-gradient variational inference. By applying techniques such as batch normalisation, data augmentation, and distributed training, we achieve similar performance in about the same number of epochs as the Adam optimiser, even on large datasets such as ImageNet. Importantly, the benefits of Bayesian principles are preserved: predictive probabilities are well-calibrated and uncertainties on out-of-distribution data are improved. This work enables practical deep learning while preserving benefits of Bayesian principles. A PyTorch implementation will be available as a plug-and-play optimiser.

**Cross-Lingual Training for Automatic Question Generation**

Automatic question generation (QG) is a challenging problem in natural language understanding. QG systems are typically built assuming access to a large number of training instances where each instance is a question and its corresponding answer. For a new language, such training instances are hard to obtain making the QG problem even more challenging. Using this as our motivation, we study the reuse of an available large QG dataset in a secondary language (e.g. English) to learn a QG model for a primary language (e.g. Hindi) of interest. For the primary language, we assume access to a large amount of monolingual text but only a small QG dataset. We propose a cross-lingual QG model which uses the following training regime: (i) Unsupervised pretraining of language models in both primary and secondary languages and (ii) joint supervised training for QG in both languages. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach using two different primary languages, Hindi and Chinese. We also create and release a new question answering dataset for Hindi consisting of 6555 sentences.

**Removing Rain in Videos: A Large-scale Database and A Two-stream ConvLSTM Approach**

Rain removal has recently attracted increasing research attention, as it is able to enhance the visibility of rain videos. However, the existing learning based rain removal approaches for videos suffer from insufficient training data, especially when applying deep learning to remove rain. In this paper, we establish a large-scale video database for rain removal (LasVR), which consists of 316 rain videos. Then, we observe from our database that there exist the temporal correlation of clean content and similar patterns of rain across video frames. According to these two observations, we propose a two-stream convolutional long- and short- term memory (ConvLSTM) approach for rain removal in videos. The first stream is composed of the subnet for rain detection, while the second stream is the subnet of rain removal that leverages the features from the rain detection subnet. Finally, the experimental results on both synthetic and real rain videos show the proposed approach performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches.

**Can You Trust Your Model’s Uncertainty? Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty Under Dataset Shift**

Modern machine learning methods including deep learning have achieved great success in predictive accuracy for supervised learning tasks, but may still fall short in giving useful estimates of their predictive {\em uncertainty}. Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model’s output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration. We find that traditional post-hoc calibration does indeed fall short, as do several other previous methods. However, some methods that marginalize over models give surprisingly strong results across a broad spectrum of tasks.

**Contextual Relabelling of Detected Objects**

Contextual information, such as the co-occurrence of objects and the spatial and relative size among objects provides deep and complex information about scenes. It also can play an important role in improving object detection. In this work, we present two contextual models (rescoring and re-labeling models) that leverage contextual information (16 contextual relationships are applied in this paper) to enhance the state-of-the-art RCNN-based object detection (Faster RCNN). We experimentally demonstrate that our models lead to enhancement in detection performance using the most common dataset used in this field (MSCOCO).

**(Pen-) Ultimate DNN Pruning**

DNN pruning reduces memory footprint and computational work of DNN-based solutions to improve performance and energy-efficiency. An effective pruning scheme should be able to systematically remove connections and/or neurons that are unnecessary or redundant, reducing the DNN size without any loss in accuracy. In this paper we show that prior pruning schemes require an extremely time-consuming iterative process that requires retraining the DNN many times to tune the pruning hyperparameters. We propose a DNN pruning scheme based on Principal Component Analysis and relative importance of each neuron’s connection that automatically finds the optimized DNN in one shot without requiring hand-tuning of multiple parameters.

**ZeLiC and ZeChipC: Time Series Interpolation Methods for Lebesgue or Event-based Sampling**

Lebesgue sampling is based on collecting information depending on the values of the signal. Although the interpolation methods for periodic sampling have been a topic of research for a long time, there is a lack of study in methods capable of taking advantage of the Lebesgue sampling characteristics to reconstruct time series more accurately. Indeed, Lebesgue sampling contains additional information about the shape of the signal in-between two sampled points. Using this information would allow us to generate an interpolated signal closer to the original one. That is to say, the average distance between the interpolated signal and the original signal will be smaller than a signal interpolated with other interpolation methods. In this paper, we propose two novel time series interpolation methods specifically designed for Lebesgue sampling called ZeLiC and ZeChipC. ZeLiC is an algorithm that combines both Zero-order hold interpolation and Linear interpolation to reconstruct time series. ZeChipC is a similar idea, it is a combination of Zero-order hold and PCHIP interpolation. Zero-order hold interpolation is favourable for interpolating abrupt changes while Linear and PCHIP interpolation are more suitable for smooth transitions. In order to apply one method or the other, we have introduced a new concept called tolerated region. ZeLiC and ZeChipC include a new functionality to adapt the reconstructed signal to concave/convex regions. The proposed methods have been compared with the state-of-the-art interpolation methods using Lebesgue sampling and have offered higher average performance. Additionally, we have compared the performance of the methods using both Riemann and Lebesgue sampling using an approximate number of sampled points. The performance of the combination ‘Lebesgue sampling with ZeChipC interpolation method’ is clearly much better than any other combination.

**Combining Generative and Discriminative Models for Hybrid Inference**

A graphical model is a structured representation of the data generating process. The traditional method to reason over random variables is to perform inference in this graphical model. However, in many cases the generating process is only a poor approximation of the much more complex true data generating process, leading to suboptimal estimation. The subtleties of the generative process are however captured in the data itself and we can `learn to infer’, that is, learn a direct mapping from observations to explanatory latent variables. In this work we propose a hybrid model that combines graphical inference with a learned inverse model, which we structure as in a graph neural network, while the iterative algorithm as a whole is formulated as a recurrent neural network. By using cross-validation we can automatically balance the amount of work performed by graphical inference versus learned inference. We apply our ideas to the Kalman filter, a Gaussian hidden Markov model for time sequences, and show, among other things, that our model can estimate the trajectory of a noisy chaotic Lorenz Attractor much more accurately than either the learned or graphical inference run in isolation.

**An End-to-End Learning-based Cost Estimator**

Cost and cardinality estimation is vital to query optimizer, which can guide the plan selection. However traditional empirical cost and cardinality estimation techniques cannot provide high-quality estimation, because they cannot capture the correlation between multiple columns. Recently the database community shows that the learning-based cardinality estimation is better than the empirical methods. However, existing learning-based methods have several limitations. Firstly, they can only estimate the cardinality, but cannot estimate the cost. Secondly, convolutional neural network (CNN) with average pooling is hard to represent complicated structures, e.g., complex predicates, and the model is hard to be generalized. To address these challenges, we propose an effective end-to-end learning-based cost estimation framework based on a tree-structured model, which can estimate both cost and cardinality simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end cost estimator based on deep learning. We propose effective feature extraction and encoding techniques, which consider both queries and physical operations in feature extraction. We embed these features into our tree-structured model. We propose an effective method to encode string values, which can improve the generalization ability for predicate matching. As it is prohibitively expensive to enumerate all string values, we design a patten-based method, which selects patterns to cover string values and utilizes the patterns to embed string values. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets and experimental results showed that our method outperformed baselines.

**Localizing Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks**

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on a sequence of tasks. While this phenomenon was studied in the past, there is only very limited recent research on this phenomenon. We propose a method for determining the contribution of individual parameters in an ANN to catastrophic forgetting. The method is used to analyze an ANNs response to three different continual learning scenarios.

**Gradio: Hassle-Free Sharing and Testing of ML Models in the Wild**

Accessibility is a major challenge of machine learning (ML). Typical ML models are built by specialists and require specialized hardware/software as well as ML experience to validate. This makes it challenging for non-technical collaborators and endpoint users (e.g. physicians) to easily provide feedback on model development and to gain trust in ML. The accessibility challenge also makes collaboration more difficult and limits the ML researcher’s exposure to realistic data and scenarios that occur in the wild. To improve accessibility and facilitate collaboration, we developed an open-source Python package, Gradio, which allows researchers to rapidly generate a visual interface for their ML models. Gradio makes accessing any ML model as easy as sharing a URL. Our development of Gradio is informed by interviews with a number of machine learning researchers who participate in interdisciplinary collaborations. Their feedback identified that Gradio should support a variety of interfaces and frameworks, allow for easy sharing of the interface, allow for input manipulation and interactive inference by the domain expert, as well as allow embedding the interface in iPython notebooks. We developed these features and carried out a case study to understand Gradio’s usefulness and usability in the setting of a machine learning collaboration between a researcher and a cardiologist.

**Model predictive control with stage cost shaping inspired by reinforcement learning**

This work presents a suboptimality study of a particular model predictive control with a stage cost shaping based on the ideas of reinforcement learning. The focus of the suboptimality study is to derive quantities relating the infinite-horizon cost function under the said variant of model predictive control to the respective infinite-horizon value function. The basis control scheme involves usual stabilizing constraints comprising of a terminal set and a terminal cost in the form of a local Lyapunov function. The stage cost is adapted using the principles of Q-learning, a particular approach to reinforcement learning. The work is concluded by case studies with two systems for wide ranges of initial conditions.

**Quaternion Collaborative Filtering for Recommendation**

This paper proposes Quaternion Collaborative Filtering (QCF), a novel representation learning method for recommendation. Our proposed QCF relies on and exploits computation with Quaternion algebra, benefiting from the expressiveness and rich representation learning capability of Hamilton products. Quaternion representations, based on hypercomplex numbers, enable rich inter-latent dependencies between imaginary components. This encourages intricate relations to be captured when learning user-item interactions, serving as a strong inductive bias as compared with the real-space inner product. All in all, we conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of Quaternion algebra in recommender systems. The results exhibit that QCF outperforms a wide spectrum of strong neural baselines on all datasets. Ablative experiments confirm the effectiveness of Hamilton-based composition over multi-embedding composition in real space.

**Multi-Frequency Vector Diffusion Maps**

We introduce multi-frequency vector diffusion maps (MFVDM), a new framework for organizing and analyzing high dimensional datasets. The new method is a mathematical and algorithmic generalization of vector diffusion maps (VDM) and other non-linear dimensionality reduction methods. MFVDM combines different nonlinear embeddings of the data points defined with multiple unitary irreducible representations of the alignment group that connect two nodes in the graph. We illustrate the efficacy of MFVDM on synthetic data generated according to a random graph model and cryo-electron microscopy image dataset. The new method achieves better nearest neighbor search and alignment estimation than the state-of-the-arts VDM and diffusion maps (DM) on extremely noisy data.

**Generating Question-Answer Hierarchies**

The process of knowledge acquisition can be viewed as a question-answer game between a student and a teacher in which the student typically starts by asking broad, open-ended questions before drilling down into specifics (Hintikka, 1981; Hakkarainen and Sintonen, 2002). This pedagogical perspective motivates a new way of representing documents. In this paper, we present SQUASH (Specificity-controlled Question-Answer Hierarchies), a novel and challenging text generation task that converts an input document into a hierarchy of question-answer pairs. Users can click on high-level questions (e.g., ‘Why did Frodo leave the Fellowship?’) to reveal related but more specific questions (e.g., ‘Who did Frodo leave with?’). Using a question taxonomy loosely based on Lehnert (1978), we classify questions in existing reading comprehension datasets as either ‘general’ or ‘specific’. We then use these labels as input to a pipelined system centered around a conditional neural language model. We extensively evaluate the quality of the generated QA hierarchies through crowdsourced experiments and report strong empirical results.

**Classical Policy Gradient: Preserving Bellman’s Principle of Optimality**

We propose a new objective function for finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes that better captures Bellman’s principle of optimality, and provide an expression for the gradient of the objective.

**Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection**

Deep approaches to anomaly detection have recently shown promising results over shallow approaches on high-dimensional data. Typically anomaly detection is treated as an unsupervised learning problem. In practice however, one may have—in addition to a large set of unlabeled samples—access to a small pool of labeled samples, e.g. a subset verified by some domain expert as being normal or anomalous. Semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection make use of such labeled data to improve detection performance. Few deep semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection have been proposed so far and those that exist are domain-specific. In this work, we present Deep SAD, an end-to-end methodology for deep semi-supervised anomaly detection. Using an information-theoretic perspective on anomaly detection, we derive a loss motivated by the idea that the entropy for the latent distribution of normal data should be lower than the entropy of the anomalous distribution. We demonstrate in extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 along with other anomaly detection benchmark datasets that our approach is on par or outperforms shallow, hybrid, and deep competitors, even when provided with only few labeled training data.

**Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT**

Transformer architectures show significant promise for natural language processing. Given that a single pretrained model can be fine-tuned to perform well on many different tasks, these networks appear to extract generally useful linguistic features. A natural question is how such networks represent this information internally. This paper describes qualitative and quantitative investigations of one particularly effective model, BERT. At a high level, linguistic features seem to be represented in separate semantic and syntactic subspaces. We find evidence of a fine-grained geometric representation of word senses. We also present empirical descriptions of syntactic representations in both attention matrices and individual word embeddings, as well as a mathematical argument to explain the geometry of these representations.

**A novel approach to model exploration for value function learning**

Planning and Learning are complementary approaches. Planning relies on deliberative reasoning about the current state and sequence of future reachable states to solve the problem. Learning, on the other hand, is focused on improving system performance based on experience or available data. Learning to improve the performance of planning based on experience in similar, previously solved problems, is ongoing research. One approach is to learn Value function (cost-to-go) which can be used as heuristics for speeding up search-based planning. Existing approaches in this direction use the results of the previous search for learning the heuristics. In this work, we present a search-inspired approach of systematic model exploration for the learning of the value function which does not stop when a plan is available but rather prolongs search such that not only resulting optimal path is used but also extended region around the optimal path. This, in turn, improves both the efficiency and robustness of successive planning. Additionally, the effect of losing admissibility by using ML heuristic is managed by bounding ML with other admissible heuristics.

**FSPool: Learning Set Representations with Featurewise Sort Pooling**

We introduce a pooling method for sets of feature vectors based on sorting features across elements of the set. This allows a deep neural network for sets to learn more flexible representations. We also demonstrate how FSPool can be used to construct a permutation-equivariant auto-encoder. On a toy dataset of polygons and a set version of MNIST, we show that such an auto-encoder produces considerably better reconstructions. Used in set classification, FSPool significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed on the set versions of MNIST and CLEVR.

**Iterative Self-Learning: Semi-Supervised Improvement to Dataset Volumes and Model Accuracy**

A novel semi-supervised learning technique is introduced based on a simple iterative learning cycle together with learned thresholding techniques and an ensemble decision support system. State-of-the-art model performance and increased training data volume are demonstrated, through the use of unlabelled data when training deeply learned classification models. Evaluation of the proposed approach is performed on commonly used datasets when evaluating semi-supervised learning techniques as well as a number of more challenging image classification datasets (CIFAR-100 and a 200 class subset of ImageNet).

**One-Shot Neural Architecture Search via Compressive Sensing**

Neural architecture search (NAS), or automated design of neural network models, remains a very challenging meta-learning problem. Several recent works (called ‘one-shot’ approaches) have focused on dramatically reducing NAS running time by leveraging proxy models that still provide architectures with competitive performance. In our work, we propose a new meta-learning algorithm that we call CoNAS, or Compressive sensing-based Neural Architecture Search. Our approach merges ideas from one-shot approaches with iterative techniques for learning low-degree sparse Boolean polynomial functions. We validate our approach on several standard test datasets, discover novel architectures hitherto unreported, and achieve competitive (or better) results in both performance and search time compared to existing NAS approaches. Further, we support our algorithm with a theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds on the number of measurements needed to perform reliable meta-learning; to our knowledge, these analysis tools are novel to the NAS literature and may be of independent interest.
