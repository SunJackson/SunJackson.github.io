Visualizations for Algorithmic trading is rising in demanded by the economic sector. In R there are a lot of great packages for getting data, visualizations and model strategies for algoritmic trading. In this article you learn how to perform visualizations and modelling for algorithmic trading in R

## Introduction to Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading is a very popular machine learning method within the economic and financial sector. Typically it involves a lot of programming and visualization. The programming is nesecary in order to get the financial data for the Algorithmic Trading analysis.

## Read packages into R library

First things first! We need to read these great packages into the R library:

In the above packages you need to install `BiocParallel` with this code:

## Read data into R for Algorithmic Trading

Next it is time to get the data. This involves a lot of programming in R:

## Make visualizations for Algorithmic Trading

Now we can make the first graph visualizations:

This gives us the following visualization graph with `dygraph`:

Now loet us calculate the number of cores in the data and apply this in the visualization graph:

This gives us the following visualization:

Before making the third visualisation we need to do some more programming:

The above programming gives us the following visualization:![](https://i0.wp.com/datascienceplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/v3-490x374.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

Next let us make a programmed visualization of adjusted stock prices over time:

The above programming gives us the following visualization:

## Simple Trading Strategy with Trend Following

Next we will program a visualization of interactive Apple Moving Avereges over time:

The above programming gives us the following visualization:![](https://i0.wp.com/datascienceplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/V5-1-490x374.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
