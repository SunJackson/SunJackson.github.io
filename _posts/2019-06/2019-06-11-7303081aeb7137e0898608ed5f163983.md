I had another lazy weekend go at code golf, trying to code in the most condensed way the following task. Provided with a square matrix *A* of positive integers, keep iterating the steps 

- take the highest square *ğ�‘¥Â²* in *A*.

- find the smallest adjacent neighbour ğ�‘›

- replace *xÂ²* with x and n with *nx*


until no square is left (with neighbour defined as either horizontally or vertically and without wrapping around). While I managed a 217 bytes solution, compared with Robinâ€™s 179b improvement, which remains surprising readable!, the puzzle offers two further questions:

1. is there a non-iterative way to find the final matrix B?

1. the puzzle assumes that A satisfies that at each step, the highest square *xÂ²* and the smallest neighbour *n* will be unique, and that the sequence will not repeat forever. Is there a fool-proof way to check this is the case?
