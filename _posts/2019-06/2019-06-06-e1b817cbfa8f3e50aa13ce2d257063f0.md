Jupyter has become a defacto platform for many of us due to its simple design, interactivity benefits and cross-language support all in one place. There are other ways to use a notebook environment but none so far I have seen offer so many benefits than Jupyter.

I say Jupyter because previously there was only Jupyter Notebooks but now there's Jupyter Lab as well and other notebook environments based on Jupyter.

Here are some simple ways to organize your project (this is based on my personal experience).

 

### 1. Install nb-extensions

 **This is the basis for efficient reporting in Jupyter**

I recommend installing through Anaconda since it will also automatically install the Javascript and CSS files that are also needed.



*If your having trouble installing it through Anaconda, use pip instead*



Once you have completed installing nbextensions you can start your Jupyter notebook environment and navigate to the tab.

Once you have this just enable the extensions you would like and experiment to see which extensions will help you be more productive.

*if you do not see this tab at any point you use Jupyter notebooks just open a new kernel and go to Edit -> nbextensions config*

 

### 2. Table of Contents

 You can enable an interactive TOC and one which will appear at the very top of your notebook. The interactive version will appear on the left side of your screen by default but can then be moved to another part of your notebook if you wish.

### 3. Use Markdown

 This one is more or less obvious to those who already use it. Some basic commands are:

- **Esc + m** to convert a code chunk into a markdown cell

- **Ctrl + Enter** to execute the markdown chunk and turn it into plain text.

- **Esc + m** again if you want to edit a markdown chunk


Here is a list of general markdown commands: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

**Use Headings**This goes hand-in-hand with markdown and the Table of Contents. As can be seen in the above image, adding headings with markdown in Jupyter will automatically section it and add it to he list of contents making it easier for the user to scroll and locate whatever they want.

**Use Latex**This is dependent on the user of course as not everyone needs to have mathematical equations rendered on their notebook. 

See here for more info on using markdown in Jupyter

 

### 4. Use Scratchpad

Using this extension allows us to reduce non essential code that would otherwise end up in the notebook. If you need to verify anything from previous output, you can just type it into the Scratchpad and it will not end up in the notebook

### 5. Hide code

 

**Hide selected cells**If you only want to hide certain code / input cells and keep some visible, use the following extension:

**Hide all code / input cells**If you wish to hide all your code so that people will only see the output, use the following extension:

### 6. Render/Convert Notebook to PDF/HTML etc

Jupyter Notebook gives us the ability to render the notebook into many formats. Below you will find the list of available options.I find this a more reliable process than going to File -> Download as....



*You may need to install external dependencies such as latex or pandoc etc. consult the documentation for rendering further.*

**Finally, the extension that you would not have heard of but should download straight away (especially if you are a beginner)**

 

### 7. Setup

 **check out this handy extension by Will Koehrsen**Set Your Jupyter Notebook up Right with this Extension

Will has created this amazing extension that gives you a great setup for anyone looking to organize their notebook for an easier workflow.

Some more handy tips are:

**Esc+a** to add cells above
**Esc+b** to add cells below
**Esc+m** to activate markdown cell and **Ctrl+Enter** to execute.
**Esc+d** to delete cell
