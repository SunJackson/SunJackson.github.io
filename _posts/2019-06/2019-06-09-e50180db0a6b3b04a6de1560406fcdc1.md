I did another twitter thread on the aforeblogged MowerPlus database as I explored the tables after a second mow to determine what identified a unique mowing â€œsessionâ€� (using John Deereâ€™s terms).

This is the thread:


For those folks who are sanely averse to Twitter but have been following along in the blog the overall TLDR is that this time around it took less time since I didnâ€™t have to go over areas twice and that the `ZSESSION` column in the `ZMOWLOCATION` table hold the session id for a given mowing session.

I wrapped up how to get access to the MowerPlus SQLite DB that holds this data into one function and you can see a non-Twitter (and non-annotated) version of the Twitter thread here â€” this rmarkdown report â€” or below:

Iâ€™ll likely make a small package for this since Iâ€™ll use it during mowing season so check the usual suspects (sourcehut/gitlab/gitugh) if you, too, want to use R to help analyze your mower data.
