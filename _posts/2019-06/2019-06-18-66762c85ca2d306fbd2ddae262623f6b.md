Python users come from all sorts of backgrounds, but computer science skills make the difference between a Python apprentice and a Python master. Researchers, data analysts, and self-taught programmers can all accelerate their Python education and get new solutions to their problems by mastering classic computer science techniques.

If you want a deeper understanding of Python’s power and flexibility, then Classic Computer Science Problems in Python will sharpen your computer science skills to a professional level. Written by David Kopec, an assistant professor of Computer Science and Innovation at Champlain College, it sets intermediate Python programmers on a workout of coding challenges. Crack problems ranging from simple tasks like binary search algorithms, to clustering data using k-means, and building neural networks. Each problem takes you hands-on with computer science techniques that you can use to solve real-world issues for apps, data, speed and performance, and even nailing your next job interview!

If you want to test yourself against the kind of problems you’d be set in a computer science course, this is the book for you. Find out why these tried-and-true approaches have stood the test of time, and are still the best way to solve many common programming challenges today.
