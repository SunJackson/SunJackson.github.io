Just a couple of announcements regarding my family of packages for working with Azure from R.

First, the packages have moved from the cloudyr org on GitHub to the Azure org, thus making them "official". A (rather spartan) homepage is here, containing links to the individual repos:

https://github.com/Azure/AzureR

The cloudyr repos will remain, but going forward they'll be mirrors of the main repos in Azure. Please submit issues and PRs to the Azure repos.

Second, the AzureKeyVault package is now available, on GitHub and on CRAN! This is an interface to the Key Vault service, which allows secure storage of cryptographic keys, certificates, and generic secrets. Both Resource Manager and client interfaces are provided. The package allows you to carry out operations such as encryption and decryption, certificate signing, and managing storage account keys.

Some sample code:

 





Any comments and feedback welcome.
