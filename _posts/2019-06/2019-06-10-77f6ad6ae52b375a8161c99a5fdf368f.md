`reticulate` is an R package that allows us to use Python modules from within RStudio. I recently found this functionality useful while trying to compare the results of different uplift models. Though I did have R’s `uplift` package producing Qini charts and metrics, I also wanted to see how things looked with Wayfair’s promising `pylift` package. Since `pylift` is only available in python, `reticulate` made it easy for me to quickly use `pylift` from within RStudio.

In the article below, I’ll show how I worked through the following circumstances:

- Since `pylift` has only been tested on Python >= 3.6, and my system version of Python was 2.7, I needed to build and install Python 3.6 for myself, preferably within a self-contained virtual environment.

- I wanted to install `pylift` in the virtual environment and set up `reticulate` in my R Project to work within that environment.

- Finally, I needed to access `pylift` from an R Markdown document via the `reticulate` interface.


Note: for consistency, I always use an instance created via r-studio-instance and a base project from r-studio-project.

Python 2.7 is the default on the systems I use (CentOS 6/7). Since I did not want to modify the system-level Python version, I installed Python 3.6.x at the user level in `$HOME/opt` and created a virtual environment using Python 3. I then activated the Python 3 environment and installed `pylift`. Finally, I ensured RStudio-Server 1.2 was installed, as it has advanced `reticulate` support like plotting graphs in line in R Markdown documents.

Below is a brief script that accomplishes the tasks in bash on CentOS 7:

```
cd ~
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/Python-3.6.2.tgz
tar -xzvf Python-3.6.2.tgz
cd Python-3.6.2
./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/python-3.6.2 --enable-shared
make
make install
cd ~
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/opt/python-3.6.2/lib
virtualenv -p $HOME/opt/python-3.6.2/bin/python3 pylift
source pylift/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/wayfair/pylift
cd pylift
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-ide-build/server/centos6/x86_64/rstudio-server-rhel-1.2.1335-x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install -y --nogpgcheck rstudio-server-rhel-1.2.1335-x86_64.rpm
sudo rstudio-server start
```

Some notes:

- the `--enable-shared` option is required when building Python in order for `reticulate` to work

- the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` library also needs to be set prior to creating the virtual environment

- we use virtualenv to create a virtual environment called “pylift” and then ensure that all Python packages are installed to that environment only (so as not to pollute any other environments we are working with)

- we then clone the `pylift` source and install `pylift` along with all of its requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- finally, we install the RStudio Server 1.2 Preview version in order to leverage its advanced `reticulate` features


Switching from bash to RStudio, we load `reticulate` and set it up to use the virtual environment we just created. Finally, and specific to `pylift`, we set matplotlib parameters so that we can plot directly in R.

```
library(reticulate)

Sys.setenv(LD_LIBRARY_PATH = paste0(Sys.getenv("HOME"),"/opt/python-3.6.2/lib"))
Sys.getenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH")
use_virtualenv("/home/rstevenson/pylift", required=TRUE)
py_config()

# Currently this must be run in order for R-markdown plotting to work
matplotlib <- import("matplotlib")
matplotlib$use("Agg", force = TRUE)
```

The following replicates the first part of pylift tutorial: simulated data

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = 1 + np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
plt.plot(t,s)
```

When run, the above code chunk should display a sinusoidal graph below it.

```
import numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, pandas as pd
from pylift import TransformedOutcome
from pylift.generate_data import dgp
# Generate some data.
df = dgp(N=10000, discrete_outcome=True)

# Specify your dataframe, treatment column, and outcome column.
up = TransformedOutcome(df, col_treatment='Treatment', col_outcome='Outcome', stratify=df['Treatment'])

# This function randomly shuffles your training data set and calculates net information value.
up.NIV()
```

The above Python chunk uses `reticulate` from within RStudio to interact with `pylift` in the context of a custom virtual environment, using a custom version of Python. This degree of customization and functionality should be useful to users who:

- want to use a different Python version than they typically use while not affecting their typical setup by way of a virtual environment

- want to install a Python module like `pylift` within a virtual environment so as not to affect any of their user- or system-level Python module installations

- want to use `reticulate` from RStudio to access a custom virtual environment, Python version, and Python modules

- wants to be able to delete the virtual environment and R-Project and have everything go back to the way it was

- wants to be able to reproduce or share the environment exactly so that the workflow can be shared with others
