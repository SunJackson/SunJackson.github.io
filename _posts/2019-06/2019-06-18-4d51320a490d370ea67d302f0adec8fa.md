It has been only two months since I summarized my reviews of point-and-click front ends for R, and it’s already out of date! I have converted that post into a regularly-updated article and added a plot of total features, which I repeat below. It shows the total number of features in each package, including the latest versions of BlueSky Statistics, JASP, and jamovi. The reviews which initially appeared as blog posts are now regularly-updated pages.

## New Features in JASP

Let’s take a look at some of the new features, starting with the version of JASP that was released three hours ago:

Interface adjustments

- Data panel, analysis input panel and results panel can be manipulated much more intuitively with sliders and show/hide buttons

- Changed the analysis input panel to have an overview of all opened analyses and added the possibility to change titles, to show documentation, and remove analyses


A complete list of fixes and features is available here. JASP is available for free from their download page.  My comparative review of JASP is here.

## New Features in jamovi

Two of the usability features added to jamovi recently are templates and multi-file input. Both are described in detail here. 

Templates enable you to save all the steps in your work as a template file. Opening that file in jamovi then lets you open a new dataset and the template will recreate all the previous analyses and graphs using the new data. It provides reusability without having to depend on the R code that GUI users are trying to avoid using.

The multi-file input lets you select many CSV files at once and jamovi will open and stack them all (they must contain common variable names, of course). 

Other new analytic features have been added with a set of modeling modules. They’re described in detail here, and a list of some of their capability is below. You can read my full review of jamovi here, and you can download it for free here.
