The modelDown package turns classification or regression models into HTML static websites.With one command you can convert one or more models into a website with visual and tabular model summaries. Summaries like model performance, feature importance, single feature response profiles and basic model audits.

The modelDown uses DALEX explainers. So it’s model agnostic (feel free to combine random forest with glm), easy to extend and parameterise.

Here you can browse an example website automatically created for 4 classification models (random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbours). The R code beyond this example is here.

Fun facts:

– archivist hooks are generated for every documented object. So you can easily extract R objects from the HTML website. Try 

`archivist::aread("MI2DataLab/modelDown_example/docs/repository/574defd6a96ecf7e5a4026699971b1d7")`

– session info is automatically recorded. So you can check version of packages available at model development (https://github.com/MI2DataLab/modelDown_example/blob/master/docs/session_info/session_info.txt)

– This package is initially created by Magda Tatarynowicz, Kamil Romaszko, Mateusz Urbański from Warsaw University of Technology as a student project.
