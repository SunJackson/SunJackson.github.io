## Introduction

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout data science. Yet because linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics, many data scientists have little experience with it. A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This article is particularly aimed at linear algebra for these two econometrical/statistical disciplines. Let us dive into the world of linear algebra for machine learning and deep learning with R:

## Matrix Multiplication

Let us start by creating a Matrix Multiplication in R:

### Hadamard Multiplication

Let us try creating a Hadamard Multiplication in R:

### Dot Product

Let us now create Dot Product in R:

Let us now create Dot Product function in R:

### Properties of Matrix Multiplication

Let us look at Properties of Matrix Multiplication in R:

#1 Matrix Property: It is Distributive Matrix

#2 Matrix Property: It is Associative Matrix

#3 Matrix Property: It is Not Commutative Matrix

## Matrix Transpose

Let us look at Matrix Transpose in R:

Let us look at Matrix Transpose Property in R:

## Solve System of Linear Equations

Now let us Solve System of Linear Equations in R:

## Identity Matrix

Now let us Solve Identity Matrix in R:

## Matrix Inverse

Now let us Solve Matrix Inverse in R:

## Solve System of Linear Equations Revisited

Let us look at Solve System of Linear Equations Revisited in R:

## Determinant

Let us find the Determinant Matrix in R:

## Matrix Norm

Let us now look at the Matrix Norm:

Let us find Properties between Matrix Norm and the Determinant Matrix in R:

## Frobenius Norm

The Frobenius norm, sometimes also called the Euclidean norm (a term unfortunately also used for the vector L^2-norm), is matrix norm of an m×n matrix A defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements. The Frobenius norm is the only one out of the above three matrix norms that is unitary invariant, i.e., it is conserved or invariant under a unitary transformation.Let us find Frobenius Norm Matrix in R:

## Special Matrices and Vectors

Let us look at Special Matrices and Vectors in R:

#1 Special Matrix: The Diagonal Matrix

#2 Special Matrix: The Symmetric Matrix

#3 Special Matrix: The Unit Vector

#4 Special Matrix: Orthogonal Vectors

#4 Special Matrix: More Orthogonal Vectors

#4 Special Matrix: Still More Orthogonal Vectors

## Eigendecomposition

Let us Now look at Eigendecomposition in R:

## Singular Value Decomposition

Now let us look at Singular Value Decomposition in R:

## Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse

Now let us look at Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse in R:

## Trace Matrix in R

Lastly, let us look at Trace Matrix in R:

We can also code a function that calculates the Trace Matrix of the Frobenius Norm Matrix:

Let us look at the diagonals (1:5) of the Trace Matrix of the Frobenius Norm Trace Matrix:

Let us also look at the diagonals (6:10) of the Trace Matrix of the Frobenius Norm Trace Matrix:

Let us anow look at the diagonals (11:15) of the Trace Matrix of the Frobenius Norm Trace Matrix:

Let us alsos see if all conditions of the Frobenius Norm Trace Matrix are true:
