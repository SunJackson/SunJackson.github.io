Writing functions that take data frame columns as arguments is a problem that most R users have beenconfronted with at some point. There are different ways to tackle this issue, and this blog post willfocus on the solution provided by the latest release of the `{rlang}` package. You can read theannouncement here, which explains reallywell what was wrong with the old syntax, and how the new syntax works now.

{% raw %}
I have written about the problem of writing functions that use data frame columns as argumentsthree years agoand two year ago too.Last year, I wrote ablog post that showed how to map a list of functions to a list of datasets with a list of columnsas arguments that used the `!!quo(column_name)` syntax (the `!!` is pronounced *bang-bang*).Now, there is a new sheriff in town, `{{}}`, introduced in `{rlang}` version 0.4.0 that makesthings even easier. The suggested pronunciation of `{{}}` is *curly-curly*, but there is noconsensus yet.
{% endraw %}

First, let’s load the `{tidyverse}`:

```
library(tidyverse)
```

Let’s suppose that I need to write a function that takes a data frame, as well as a column fromthis data frame as arguments:

```
how_many_na <- function(dataframe, column_name){
 dataframe %>%
 filter(is.na(column_name)) %>%
 count()
}
```

Let’s try this function out on the `starwars` data:

```
data(starwars)

head(starwars)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 13
## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year gender
## 
## 1 Luke… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male 
## 2 C-3PO 167 75 gold yellow 112 
## 3 R2-D2 96 32 white, bl… red 33 
## 4 Dart… 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male 
## 5 Leia… 150 49 brown light brown 19 female
## 6 Owen… 178 120 brown, gr… light blue 52 male 
## # … with 5 more variables: homeworld , species , films ,
## # vehicles , starships 
```

As you can see, there are missing values in the `hair_color` column. Let’s try to count how manymissing values are in this column:

```
how_many_na(starwars, hair_color)
```

```
Error: object 'hair_color' not found
```

R cannot find the `hair_color` column, and yet it is in the data! Well, this is actually exactlythe issue. The issue is that the column is inside the dataframe, but when calling the functionwith `hair_color` as the second argument, R is looking for a variable called `hair_color` thatdoes not exist. What about trying with `"hair_color"`?

```
how_many_na(starwars, "hair_color")
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
## n
## 
## 1 0
```

Now we get something, but something wrong!

One way to solve this issue, is to not use the `filter()` function, and instead rely on base R:

```
how_many_na_base <- function(dataframe, column_name){
 na_index <- is.na(dataframe[, column_name])
 nrow(dataframe[na_index, column_name])
}

how_many_na_base(starwars, "hair_color")
```

```
## [1] 5
```

This works, but not using the `{tidyverse}` at all is not an option, at least for me. For instance,the next function, which uses a grouping variable, would be difficult to implement without the`{tidyverse}`:

```
summarise_groups <- function(dataframe, grouping_var, column_name){
 dataframe %>%
 group_by(grouping_var) %>% 
 summarise(mean(column_name, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```

Calling this function results in the following error message:

```
Error: Column `grouping_var` is unknown
```

Before the release of `{rlang}` 0.4.0 this is was the solution:

```
summarise_groups <- function(dataframe, grouping_var, column_name){

 grouping_var <- enquo(grouping_var)
 column_name <- enquo(column_name)
 mean_name <- paste0("mean_", quo_name(column_name))

 dataframe %>%
 group_by(!!grouping_var) %>% 
 summarise(!!(mean_name) := mean(!!column_name, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```

The core of the function remained very similar to the version from before, but now one has touse the `enquo()`–`!!` syntax. While not overly difficult to use, it is cumbersome.

{% raw %}
Now this can be simplified using the new `{{}}` syntax:
{% endraw %}

```
summarise_groups <- function(dataframe, grouping_var, column_name){

 dataframe %>%
{% raw %}
 group_by({{grouping_var}}) %>% 
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
 summarise({{column_name}} := mean({{column_name}}, na.rm = TRUE))
{% endraw %}
}
```

Much easier and cleaner! You still have to use the `:=` operator instead of `=` for the column namehowever. Also, from my understanding, if you want to modify the column names, for instance in thiscase return `"mean_height"` instead of `height` you have to keep using the `enquo()`–`!!` syntax.
