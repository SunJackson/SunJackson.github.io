Dear Igor,

I just want to share a Github repo that I am maintaining for Deep Learning based compressive sensing and our recent paper toward multi-scale deep compressive sensing.

1. Multi-Scale Deep Compressive Sensing Network, IEEE VCIP 2018.  

> 
*Abstract: With joint learning of the sampling and recovery, the deep learning-based compressive sensing (DCS) has shown significant improvement in performance and running time reduction. Its reconstructed image, however, losses high-frequency content especially at low subrates. It is understood due to relatively much low-frequency information captured into the sampling matrix. This behavior happens similarly in the multi-scale sampling scheme which also samples more low-frequency components. This paper proposes a multi-scale DCS (MS-DCSNet) based on convolutional neural network. Firstly, we convert image signal using multiple scale-based wavelet transform. Then, the signal is captured through the convolution block by block across scales. The initial reconstructed image is directly recovered from multi-scale measurements. Multi-scale wavelet convolution is utilized to enhance the final reconstruction quality. The network learns to perform both multi-scale in sampling and reconstruction thus results in better reconstruction quality.*

2. Difference of Convolution for Deep Compressive Sensing, IEEE ICIP 2019 

> 
*Deep learning-based compressive sensing (DCS) has improved the compressive sensing (CS) with fast and high reconstruction quality. Researchers have further extended it to multi-scale DCS which improves reconstruction quality based on Wavelet decomposition. In this work, we mimic the Difference of Gaussian via convolution and propose a scheme named as Difference of convolution-based multi-scale DCS (DoC-DCS). Unlike the multi-scale DCS based on a well-designed filter in the wavelet domain, the proposed DoC-DCS learns decomposition, thereby, outperforms other state-of-the-art compressive sensing methods.*
