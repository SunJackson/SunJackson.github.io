**Apply here**.

**The opportunity:**

The Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University is one of the most cutting-edge research university facilities in the world.  We are now in a period of rapid growth, hiring world-class academics in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), data science, cyber security, creative technologies & human-computer interaction, and organisational and social informatics

The faculty has established a new research group, The Laboratory for Dialogue Research (LDR) led by Professor Phil Cohen, an AAAI Fellow and internationally known pioneer in natural language dialogue, multi-agent systems, and multimodal interaction. The LDR has close partnerships with Monash’s new HCI Group, its renowned Centre for Data Science, the Engineering School, and with numerous universities in Australia and worldwide. Importantly, we plan to engage with interested industry, philanthropic, and government partners on problem, data, and tool selection and development of scalable approaches.

We cordially invite the interest of outstanding research fellows who want to join this world-class team to deliver ground-breaking fundamental research that will shape the future of AI for conversational assistants, human-robot interaction, customer service, and many other application domains.

Multiple Research Fellow Openings in LDR are available at a Level A and Level B Research Fellow (equivalent to Assistant Professor in North America), with a preference for expertise in the area of natural language processing (semantic parsing, generation), dialogue, planning, plan recognition, and automated reasoning.

Applications of interest from other areas of natural language processing or multimodal interaction that could contribute to dialogue research are also strongly encouraged. The successful candidate will join a rapidly expanding multidisciplinary group in the above areas. When applying, please indicate your area of specialisation.

For more information, please see the following link:

The successful candidate will be an energetic and innovative researcher with a strong publication record who is interested in pioneering in emerging research areas. You will hold a PhD qualification in computer science, engineering, information sciences, cognitive or linguistic sciences, and have a deep interest in developing new technologies to develop the foundations of dialogue research and development.

All candidates must have a strong publication record in top conferences and journals, excellent teamwork, communication/writing skills, and your software skills and experience.

**The Melbourne Area**

For six consecutive years, Melbourne has been rated the #1 city worldwide for quality of life (see Economist & Guardian), with excellent education, healthcare, infrastructure, low crime, and exceptional cuisine, cultural activities, and creative design. The regional area is renowned for its dramatic coastline, extensive parks, exotic wildlife, and the Yarra Valley wine region.

This is a unique opportunity to join a leading “Group of 8” University with top-rankings and like-minded, passionate academics. If you feel you have the drive and expertise to contribute to this cutting-edge group, then we encourage you to apply!

The faculty is strongly committed to improving the diversity of our staff and students, and promoting a culture of equity, fairness, respect and openness. We fully support the gender equity principles of the Athena SWAN Charter.
