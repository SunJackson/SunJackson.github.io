About a week ago Bob Rudis created a nice blogpostthat I saw on my R Bloggers feed thatsimultaneously:

1. Threw a bit of *â€œshadeâ€�* on the ToS for Axios (well done Bob)

1. Showed how to use `EtherCalc` as a data entry tool

1. And, most importantly to me, showed how to make great use of a slopegraph


I happened to be on vacation at the time but as soon as I got back and caught upI vowed to follow up since slopegraphs have always fascinatedmeand I happened to write a function to make them, about a yearback. Iwanted to look at Bobâ€™s post in detail after very quickly agreeing with hispremise that it was a much better choice than a â€œdumbbell chartâ€�. So this postis about what I learned and the adjustments I made to my own function.

**This post assumes that youâ€™ve read the earlier posts.**

Letâ€™s quickly recreate the dataset Bob created in `EtherCalc` keeping it simpleusing the `str` function and choosing to make it a dataframe not a tibble.

```
library(tidyverse)
# Get the latest version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions")
library(CGPfunctions)

thedata <- structure(list(
 topic = structure(c(6L, 3L, 5L, 4L, 11L, 13L, 
 2L, 8L, 9L, 12L, 7L, 1L, 14L, 10L), 
 .Label = c("Arts & entertainment", 
 "Business", "Climate change", "Economics", "Education", "Health care", 
 "Immigration", "National Security", "Politics", "Religion", "Science", 
 "Sports", "Technology", "U.S. foreign policy"), 
 class = "factor"), 
 actually_read = c(7L, 5L, 11L, 6L, 10L, 14L, 13L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 8L, 9L, 12L), 
 say_want_covered = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 7L, 8L, 11L, 5L, 10L, 14L, 6L, 13L, 9L, 12L)), 
 class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -14L))
thedata
```

```
## topic actually_read say_want_covered
## 1 Health care 7 1
## 2 Climate change 5 2
## 3 Education 11 3
## 4 Economics 6 4
## 5 Science 10 7
## 6 Technology 14 8
## 7 Business 13 11
## 8 National Security 1 5
## 9 Politics 2 10
## 10 Sports 3 14
## 11 Immigration 4 6
## 12 Arts & entertainment 8 13
## 13 U.S. foreign policy 9 9
## 14 Religion 12 12
```

#### Making slopegraphs easy

When you look at Bobâ€™s post thereâ€™s actually a lot of code in there to make avery nice graphic. Being extraordinarily lazy I wrote my function to get aslopegraph with the least amount of work possible. The first step, which isunavoidable if you want to make use of `newggslopegraph`, though is to reshapethe data into a â€œlongerâ€� format. Weâ€™ll use `reshape2::melt` and keep the `topic`column but collapse the other two columns into a factor called `Saydo` and put theactual â€œrankâ€� into a column called `Rank`. Since â€œactually_readâ€� andâ€œsay_want_coveredâ€� are now factor levels instead of column names we can use`forcats::fct_recode` to make them much nicer built in labels when we make ourplot. Voila a new dataframe called `temp`.

```
temp <- reshape2::melt(data = thedata,
 id = "topic",
 variable.name = "Saydo",
 value.name = "Rank")
temp$Saydo <- forcats::fct_recode(temp$Saydo, 
 "Actually read" = "actually_read",
 "Say they want" = "say_want_covered")
temp
```

```
## topic Saydo Rank
## 1 Health care Actually read 7
## 2 Climate change Actually read 5
## 3 Education Actually read 11
## 4 Economics Actually read 6
## 5 Science Actually read 10
## 6 Technology Actually read 14
## 7 Business Actually read 13
## 8 National Security Actually read 1
## 9 Politics Actually read 2
## 10 Sports Actually read 3
## 11 Immigration Actually read 4
## 12 Arts & entertainment Actually read 8
## 13 U.S. foreign policy Actually read 9
## 14 Religion Actually read 12
## 15 Health care Say they want 1
## 16 Climate change Say they want 2
## 17 Education Say they want 3
## 18 Economics Say they want 4
## 19 Science Say they want 7
## 20 Technology Say they want 8
## 21 Business Say they want 11
## 22 National Security Say they want 5
## 23 Politics Say they want 10
## 24 Sports Say they want 14
## 25 Immigration Say they want 6
## 26 Arts & entertainment Say they want 13
## 27 U.S. foreign policy Say they want 9
## 28 Religion Say they want 12
```

Once we get the data in the right shape I tried to make `newggslopegraph` assimple and intuitive as possible. I love working with `ggplot` but I will admitit can get quite complex. So to create the default plot all we need to do is:

```
newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp, 
 Times = Saydo, 
 Measurement = Rank, 
 Grouping = topic)
```

```
## 
## Converting 'Saydo' to an ordered factor
```

That was pretty painless wasnâ€™t it? But clearly thereâ€™s a lot of room fortweaking! Letâ€™s make it better!

#### Tweaking

Whole books can and have been written just on the issue of graphic design so Iâ€™mnot going to try and summarize it all in one little blog post. I will however,for the impatient reader, immediately take care of a few key things:


**Titles, subtitles and captions are important!** Donâ€™t ignore them or givethem short change. Youâ€™ll notice that since we didnâ€™t initially specify them,placeholders appear. Thatâ€™s to be shameless about making you think about themeven if you eventually decide to turn them â€œoffâ€� (read thedoco)


The default is that every line is itâ€™s own color. Thatâ€™s seldom a good choicefor telling a story unless the number of topics (a.k.a. `Groups`) is verysmall. For now letâ€™s make them all â€œblackâ€� and come back to this in a bit.


By default `Measurement` is treated as a real number so the highest valuesare on the top of the graph. Makes more sense here to reverse the scale andput the highest ranked â€œ1â€� at he top. `ReverseYAxis = TRUE`. If we needed orwanted to `ReverseXAxis = TRUE` might be useful.


Our second attempt looks like this:

```
newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp, 
 Times = Saydo, 
 Measurement = Rank, 
 Grouping = topic, 
 ReverseYAxis = TRUE,
 Title = "14 Topics Ranked by What Americans Read vs Want Covered",
 SubTitle = "'Read' rank from Parse.ly May 2019 data.\n'Want covered' rank from Axios/SurveyMonkey poll conducted May 17-20, 2019",
 Caption = "Source: Axios \nMakeover by @hrbrmstr",
 LineColor = "black"
 )
```

Alright, thatâ€™s looking a little bit better for basic layout. But it doesnâ€™t yettell the reader a story and focus their attention on the message we want toconvey. To be honest Iâ€™m not a huge fan of adding a lot of annotations to a plotso letâ€™s first try to catch the readers attention by using color selectively.

#### Emphasizing the â€œslopeâ€� in slopegraph

As the name implies slopegraphs get the reader to attend to relative differencesin slope, right now our choice of â€œblackâ€� as the only color is marginally betterthan our original multicolor mess but still falls far short of conveying amessage. The `LineColor` parameter is quite flexible. The default is suitablefor a small number of topics, a single color can be the right choice on occasion,but we can also pass it a character vector of colors that is as customized as welike. For example `LineColor = c("black", "red")` would recycle the colors redand black to create an alternating pattern. We could even build a named listthat associates a color to each of the topic areas if we desired (see thevignettefor an example). But right now, that is too much effort and Iâ€™d like tohandle this by algorithm not by manually entry.

As a start point letâ€™s assume weâ€™d like to get the reader to focus onunderstanding which topics increase in rank, decrease in rank or stay the same.Weâ€™ll color increase as black, decreases as red and things that remain level aslight gray. We can accomplish that through a series of `pipes` and `dplyr`verbs.

```
colorvect <- temp %>% group_by(topic) %>% 
 summarise(difference = diff(Rank)) %>% 
 mutate(whatcolor = case_when(
 difference == 0 ~ "light gray",
 difference > 0 ~ "red",
 difference < 0 ~ "black"
 )) %>%
 select(topic, whatcolor) %>%
 tibble::deframe()
colorvect
```

```
## Arts & entertainment Business Climate change 
## "red" "black" "black" 
## Economics Education Health care 
## "black" "black" "black" 
## Immigration National Security Politics 
## "red" "red" "red" 
## Religion Science Sports 
## "light gray" "black" "red" 
## Technology U.S. foreign policy 
## "black" "light gray"
```

Each topic now has a color assigned, and itâ€™s trivial to pass our color vectorto `newggslopegraph`. While weâ€™re at it we can showcase some of the otherformatting options, like changing font sizes for the labels. `DataLabelPadding`is important if you are likely to have datapoints close together (see thevignettefor the cancer data) but in this case we can be more generous sinceranks wonâ€™t overlap.

```
newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp,
 Times = Saydo,
 Measurement = Rank,
 Grouping = topic,
 ReverseYAxis = TRUE, 
 DataTextSize = 3.5, 
 YTextSize = 4, 
 XTextSize = 16,
 DataLabelPadding = .2,
 Title = "Topic Rankings Compared Between\nWhat Americans Actually Read vs Want Covered",
 SubTitle = "'Actually Read' rank from Parse.ly May 2019 data.\n'Want covered' rank from Axios/SurveyMonkey poll conducted May 17-20, 2019",
 Caption = "Source: Axios \nMakeover by @hrbrmstr",
 LineColor = colorvect
)
```

Very nice looking, but I think it is still too crowded with colors. Letâ€™s adjustour coloring to highlight only the larger rank differences. Itâ€™s a matter ofpersonal taste but easy to adjust our little script and test, rinse and repeatuntil weâ€™re happy. Letâ€™s adjust so that changes of greater than 4 or less than 4are highlighted and the rest are gray.

```
colorvect <- temp %>% group_by(topic) %>% 
 summarise(difference = diff(Rank)) %>% 
 mutate(whatcolor = case_when(
 difference >= 4 ~ "red",
 difference <= -4 ~ "black",
 TRUE ~ "light gray"
 )) %>%
 select(topic, whatcolor) %>%
 tibble::deframe()
```

Then we can run the same lines into `newggslopegraph`.

```
newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp,
 Times = Saydo,
 Measurement = Rank,
 Grouping = topic,
 ReverseYAxis = TRUE, 
 DataTextSize = 3.5, 
 YTextSize = 4, 
 XTextSize = 16,
 DataLabelPadding = .2,
 Title = "Topic Rankings Compared Between\nWhat Americans Actually Read vs Want Covered",
 SubTitle = "'Actually Read' rank from Parse.ly May 2019 data.\n'Want covered' rank from Axios/SurveyMonkey poll conducted May 17-20, 2019",
 Caption = "Source: Axios \nMakeover by @hrbrmstr",
 LineColor = colorvect
)
```

Personally, I think that even 7 topics may be too much, but hopefully youâ€™regetting the point that while weâ€™re not losing any information, weâ€™re making iteasier for the reader to focus on the big changes in the data. Itâ€™s easy todiscern the pattern whether itâ€™s answering a simple question, such as what is thenumber one thing they say they want to read about (Health care), or a morecomplex question such as which topic has the biggest disparity (Sports).

#### Use titles, subtitles and captions well

One thing we can do to make our message clearer is make better use of the titleand subtitle areas. It seems simple but is too often forgotten. While weâ€™re atit Iâ€™ll highlight a couple of new capabilities I added to the function:


The ability to choose from a select number of `ggplot` themes. In this case BobRudis `ipsum_rc` theme.


Control the justification of the titles and subtitles and caption.


But the most important change here IMHO is simply choosing words for the titleand subtitle that convey what we want to look for in the plot or think about.

```
newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp,
 Times = Saydo,
 Measurement = Rank,
 Grouping = topic,
 ReverseYAxis = TRUE, 
 DataTextSize = 3.5, 
 YTextSize = 3.2, 
 XTextSize = 14,
 DataLabelPadding = .2,
 Title = "Americans Don't Actually Read the News They Say They Want",
 SubTitle = "Many sharp differences in rankings in both directions. Hypocrisy, laziness or gratification?",
 Caption = "Source: Rud.is \nMakeover by @hrbrmstr",
 LineColor = colorvect,
 ThemeChoice = "ipsum",
 TitleTextSize = 18,
 SubTitleTextSize = 12,
 SubTitleJustify = "right")
```

The same plot in Wall Street Journal style (`wsj`)

```
newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp,
 Times = Saydo,
 Measurement = Rank,
 Grouping = topic,
 ReverseYAxis = TRUE, 
 ReverseXAxis = TRUE,
 DataTextSize = 3.5, 
 YTextSize = 4, 
 XTextSize = 13,
 DataLabelPadding = .2,
 Title = "Americans Don't Actually Read the News They Say They Want",
 SubTitle = "Many sharp differences in rankings in both directions.\nHypocrisy or laziness or gratification?",
 Caption = "Source: Rud.is \nMakeover by @hrbrmstr",
 LineColor = colorvect,
 ThemeChoice = "wsj",
 TitleTextSize = 15,
 CaptionTextSize = 6,
 SubTitleTextSize = 11,
 SubTitleJustify = "right"
)
```

Iâ€™m not actually sure I like it better at all but simply demonstrating capability

#### A final example

In Bobâ€™s blog post he demonstrated how to add lines and arrows and text to addannotation to his plot. Iâ€™m of the mindset that less is more and too muchannotation can be a distraction not an aid to telling our story. As you can seefrom his code it is also relatively complex using native `ggplot::geom_*`â€™s toplace things exactly right.

I actually find `cowplot` easier to use for simple annotation. In the examplebelow Iâ€™ll shift to the `gdocs` theme. Save the plot and then use cowplot to addone important factoid!

```
p <- newggslopegraph(dataframe = temp,
 Times = Saydo,
 Measurement = Rank,
 Grouping = topic,
 ReverseYAxis = TRUE, 
 DataTextSize = 3.5, 
 YTextSize = 4, 
 XTextSize = 14,
 DataLabelPadding = .2,
 Title = "Americans Don't Actually Read the News They Say They Want",
 SubTitle = "Many sharp differences in rankings in both directions. Hypocrisy, laziness or gratification?",
 Caption = "Source: Rud.is \nMakeover by @hrbrmstr",
 LineColor = colorvect,
 ThemeChoice = "gdocs",
 TitleTextSize = 16,
 TitleJustify = "center",
 SubTitleTextSize = 12,
 SubTitleJustify = "center"
)

cowplot::ggdraw(p) + 
 cowplot::draw_label(label = "Reading about sports shows the\nlargest difference in ranking --\n11 places!", 
 colour = "dark blue", 
 size = 10, 
 y = .10, 
 x = .53, 
 fontface = "italic")
```
