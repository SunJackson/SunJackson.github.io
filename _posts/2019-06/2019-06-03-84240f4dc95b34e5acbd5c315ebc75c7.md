This article is my attempt to give a boost to the careers of developers who want to start with ***Machine Learning*** , ***Artificial Intelligence*** , ***Data Science*** , ***Data Mining*** , ***Natural Language Processing*** and other opportunities related to Data.

---

Starting with some of the basic questions that arise before taking the leap of faith:

- Is it necessary to know R/Python for you to explore the above fields? ***No.***

- Why do we need R/Python? ***To understand Data.***


R programming is majorly used for ***Data Analysis***. It enhances your understanding of Data and helps you explore the unexplored *Data Points*.

---

####  **Advantages**

- *Open Source*

- Being a *vector* language, function can be performed on the vector without looping through it, making it powerful.

- Itâ€™s an *interpreted language*, making it run without any compiler thus making development easier.

- Support for functions like *charts*, *graphs*, *statistical* functions etc makes it a smart choice for *data science applications* and *statistical analysis.*


####  Limitations

- *Performance & Scalability* - It can very quickly consume all available memory. (Though there are a lot of memory optimisation packages available)

- *Security* - The third party packages do not have any security check.


####  **Usage**

- From the above advantages & disadvantages, I personally feel R can be used for *understanding*, *interpreting* and *analysing* data.

- It can be used effectively in non-production applications for *preprocessing* & *cleaning* data. Also, it is a great tool to *identify data points*.

If you donâ€™t understand your data, donâ€™t expect machine to understand it.

####  **Installation**

- R can be downloaded from here.

- There are various *GUI* tools available for *R* programming like *RStudio**,* *Rattle**, and* *R Commander*. I found *RStudio* to be the best in terms of usage. It can be downloaded from here.

####  **Understanding RStudio**

*RStudio with 4 Sections*

- **Top Left** â†’ Editor where the code is written (Similar to *VS Code*, *Sublime* etc)

- **Bottom Left** â†’ Console (Similarly to the *developer console* and *terminals*)

- **Top Right** â†’ This is where all the variables used are listed along with the values.

- **Bottom Right** â†’ This contains 5 panels***1.*** ***Files*** â†’ For organising and opening necessary files.***2.*** ***Plot*** â†’ Any plots drawn are displayed here.***3.*** ***Packages*** â†’ Shows list of system as well as user packages. (Checked***4.*** ***Help*** â†’ As the name suggests.***5.*** ***Viewer*** â†’ This panel is used to view local web content like static html files or a web application running locally.

Thanks for reading. In my next article, Iâ€™ll be explaining the usage of ***variables*** and ***functions***.
