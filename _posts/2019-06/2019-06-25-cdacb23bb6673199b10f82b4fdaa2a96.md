Exciting news!

I’ve just RE-released my very first course (no longer available on any platform anywhere else), which was focused on MATLAB for signal processing with images and sound.

Crazy to think that I made this course FIVE years ago. This course was not even my idea!

It can be thought of as the MATLAB equivalent of my free Numpy course (which is for Python).

Of course, this is not for everybody, as MATLAB is not free and is a pretty niche language, but this should be nice for those of you who actually work with MATLAB either in school or at your job.

Or of course, you can get it just to support future content and to have a full collection. ðŸ˜‰
