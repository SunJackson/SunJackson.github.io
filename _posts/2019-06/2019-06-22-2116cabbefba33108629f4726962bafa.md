The odds ratio represents the odds that an outcome will occur given the presence of a specific predictor, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that predictor, assuming all other predictors remain constant.The odds ratio is calculated from the exponential function of the coefficient estimate based on a unit increase in the predictor *(on a side note, coefficient estimates are unbiased but odds ratio are biases due to transformation)*.An example with a continuous variable, will be for 1 mm Hg increased in resting blood pressure `rest_bp`, the odds of having heart disease increases by a factor of 1.05.

```
broom::tidy(lr_model$fit) %>% filter(term=="rest_bp") %>% mutate(odds_ratio= exp(estimate)) %>% select(term, estimate, odds_ratio)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 3
## term estimate odds_ratio
## 
## 1 rest_bp 0.0453 1.05
```

An example with a categorical variable will be chest pain during exercise stress test `ex_cpyes`. If chest pain is present, the odds of having heart disease increases by a factor of 1.52. In percentage change, the odds for heart disease is 52.6% higher for individuals with chest pain during the exercise stress test than individuals with no chest pain.

```
broom::tidy(lr_model$fit) %>% filter(term=="ex_cpyes") %>% mutate(odds_ratio= exp(estimate), percentage= (odds_ratio-1)*100) %>% select(term, estimate, odds_ratio, percentage)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
## term estimate odds_ratio percentage
## 
## 1 ex_cpyes 0.437 1.55 54.8
```

Researchers like odds ratio as it can be used to determine whether a variable is a risk factor for a particular outcome, and compare the magnitude of various risk factors for that outcome.

Variables such as cholesterol `chol` where the odds ratio is 1 means that cholesterol does not affect odds of having heart disease.

```
broom::tidy(lr_model$fit) %>% mutate(odds_ratio= round(exp(estimate),2)) %>% select(term, estimate, odds_ratio) %>% filter(odds_ratio==1) #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21509346/r-displays-numbers-in-scientific-notation
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 3
## term estimate odds_ratio
## 
## 1 chol 0.00447 1
```

Variables such as `age`, normal resting ECG `rest_ecgnormal` have odds ratio less than 1 which suggests that exposure with these variables are associated with lower odds of having heart disease. We tend to ignore the intercept when talking about odds ratio.

```
broom::tidy(lr_model$fit) %>% mutate(odds_ratio= round(exp(estimate),2)) %>% select(term, estimate, odds_ratio) %>% filter(odds_ratio<1)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 3
## term estimate odds_ratio
## 
## 1 (Intercept) -0.750 0.47
## 2 age -0.0226 0.98
## 3 rest_cpatypical -2.13 0.12
## 4 rest_cpnon-CP pain -1.86 0.16
## 5 rest_cptypical -4.18 0.02
## 6 fast_bloodsugar>120 -0.667 0.51
## 7 rest_ecgnormal -0.779 0.46
## 8 ex_maxHR -0.0471 0.95
## 9 ex_STpeakup/norm -0.183 0.83
## 10 thalassemianorm -0.201 0.82
```

Variables such as reversable thalassemia `thalassemiareversable` and resting blood pressure `rest_bp` have odds ratio greater than 1 which suggest exposure to these variables are associated with higher odds of heart disease.ST-T abnormal during resting ECG `rest_ecgST-T abnorm`, 2 vessels coloured during angiogram `coloured_vessels2.0` and males `sexmale` have unusually large odds ratio. More thorough data exploration and feature engineering will be needed to address them. Our pre-processing was rather brief, only imputation of missing values was done.

```
broom::tidy(lr_model$fit) %>% mutate(odds_ratio= round(exp(estimate),2)) %>% select(term, estimate, odds_ratio) %>% filter(odds_ratio>1) %>% arrange(desc(odds_ratio))
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 3
## term estimate odds_ratio
## 
## 1 rest_ecgST-T abnorm 13.1 465136. 
## 2 coloured_vessels2.0 4.68 107. 
## 3 sexmale 2.48 12.0 
## 4 coloured_vessels3.0 1.62 5.04
## 5 coloured_vessels1.0 1.52 4.59
## 6 thalassemiareversable 1.26 3.53
## 7 ex_cpyes 0.437 1.55
## 8 ex_STdepression_dur 0.296 1.34
## 9 rest_bp 0.0453 1.05
## 10 ex_STpeakflat 0.0512 1.05
