**The Opportunity**

Monash University is honoured to be the first Australian university to receive a licence to operate in China, one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, via the partnership at Suzhou with the Southeast University (SEU), one of China’s key national universities as well as establishment of Monash Suzhou. The SEU-Monash partnership consists of the Joint Research Institute (JRI) and the Joint Graduate School (JGS), and will produce postgraduates and researchers with ideas to change people’s lives in the region and the world for the better.

The JRI conducts multi-disciplinary research projects in areas of strategic importance to industry in Australia and China.
