Despite being on holiday I’m getting in a bit of non-work R coding since the fam has a greater ability to sleep late than I do. Apart from other things I’ve been working on a PR into {lutz}, a package by @andyteucher that turns lat/lng pairs into timezone strings.

The package is super neat and has two modes: “fast” (originally based on a {V8}-backed version of @darkskyapp’s tzlookup javascript module) and “accurate” using R’s amazing spatial ops.

I ported the javascript algorithm to C++/Rcpp and have been tweaking the bit of package helper code that fetches this:

![](https://i0.wp.com/rud.is/b/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/darksky-tz-01.png?resize=530%2C174&ssl=1)


and extracts the embedded string tree and corresponding timezones array and turns both into something C++ can use.

Originally I just made a header file with the same long lines:

![](https://i2.wp.com/rud.is/b/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lutz-01.png?resize=530%2C156&ssl=1)


but that’s icky and fairly bad form, especially given that C++ will combine adjacent string literals for you.

The `stringi::stri_wrap()` function can easily take care of wrapping the time zone array elements for us:

but, I also needed the ability to hard-wrap the encoded string tree at a fixed width. There are lots of ways to do that, here are three of them:

```
library(Rcpp)
library(stringi)
library(tidyverse)
library(microbenchmark)

sourceCpp(code = "
#include 

// [[Rcpp::export]]
std::vector< std::string > fold_cpp(const std::string& input, int width) {

 int sz = input.length() / width;

 std::vector< std::string > out;
 out.reserve(sz); // shld make this more efficient

 for (unsigned long idx=0; idx
```

(If you know of a package that has this type of function def leave a note in the comments).

Each one does the same thing: move `n` sequences of `width` characters into a new slot in a character vector. Let’s see what they do with this toy long string example:

```
(src <- paste0(c(rep("a", 30), rep("b", 30), rep("c", 4)), collapse = ""))
## [1] "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccc"

for (n in c(1, 7, 30, 40)) {

 print(fold_base(src, n))
 print(fold_tidy(src, n))
 print(fold_cpp(src, n))
 cat("\n")

}
## [1] "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a"
## [18] "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "b" "b" "b" "b"
## [35] "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b"
## [52] "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "c" "c" "c" "c"
## [1] "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a"
## [18] "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "b" "b" "b" "b"
## [35] "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b"
## [52] "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "c" "c" "c" "c"
## [1] "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a"
## [18] "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "a" "b" "b" "b" "b"
## [35] "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b"
## [52] "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "b" "c" "c" "c" "c"
## 
## [1] "aaaaaaa" "aaaaaaa" "aaaaaaa" "aaaaaaa" "aabbbbb" "bbbbbbb"
## [7] "bbbbbbb" "bbbbbbb" "bbbbccc" "c" 
## 
## [1] "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
## [3] "cccc" 
## 
## [1] "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbb"
## [2] "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccc" 

```

So, we know they all work, which means we can take a look at which one is faster. Let’s compare folding at various widths:

```
map_df(c(1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 70), ~{
 microbenchmark(
 base = fold_base(src, .x),
 tidy = fold_tidy(src, .x),
 cpp = fold_cpp(src, .x)
 ) %>% 
 mutate(width = .x) %>% 
 as_tibble()
}) %>% 
 mutate(
 width = factor(width, 
 levels = sort(unique(width)), 
 ordered = TRUE)
 ) -> bench_df

ggplot(bench_df, aes(expr, time)) +
 ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(
 aes(group = width, fill = width),
 groupOnX = TRUE, shape = 21, color = "white", size = 3, stroke = 0.125, alpha = 1/4
 ) +
 scale_y_comma(trans = "log10", position = "right") +
 coord_flip() +
 guides(
 fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))
 ) +
 labs(
 x = NULL, y = "Time (nanoseconds)",
 fill = "Split width:", 
 title = "Performance comparison between 'fold' implementations"
 ) +
 theme_ft_rc(grid="X") +
 theme(legend.position = "top")

```

The Rcpp version is both faster and more consistent than the other two implementations (though they get faster as the number of string subsetting operations decrease); but, they’re all pretty fast. For an infrequently run process, it might be better to use the base R version purely for simplicity. Despite that fact, I used the Rcpp version to turn the string tree long line into:
