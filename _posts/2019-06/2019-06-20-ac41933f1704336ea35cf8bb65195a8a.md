Hi Folks! This is my first blog and I am super excited to share with you how I used R Programming to work upon a location based strategy in my E commerce organization. 

Please check out r-bloggers.com for more exciting stuff on R

##  ***Ju******st a litt******le brief about the problem statement*** 

I work for an e-commerce organization (an online travel platform) for booking hotels and flights based out of India. This problem is concerned with the Hotel department.

Each locality in a city behaves differently based on certain features of the locality e.g. Airport Zone of a city would behave differently from a Central Zone in the vicinity of a famous Historical Site. Therefore separate strategies are required for different areas for monitoring and controlling parameters such as Inventory, Production and Demand.

In the data I had latitude and longitude for each hotel and the task was to identify clusters of these hotels or what we call a hyperlocation.

**Letâ€™s Get Started**

This is how the data looks

Letâ€™s look at it Visually (I am using Power BI here)

**Outlier Removal** In the image above we can see there are certain hotels outside the city that can create problems while forming clusters, letâ€™s remove these outliers statistically.

```
library(geosphere)

#Mean of Lat Lon
MeanLat<- mean(HotelsCity$latitude, na.rm = TRUE)
MeanLon<- mean(HotelsCity$longitude, na.rm = TRUE)


#Distance of all hotels from mean lat lon
HotelsLatLon<- HotelsCity[,c(4,5)]
MeanLatLon<- data.frame(MeanLat,MeanLon)
Distance_Mat<- distm(HotelsLatLon[2:1],MeanLatLon[2:1],fun = distHaversine)
Distance_Mat<- as.data.frame(Distance_Mat)


#Calculating Cutoff Distance for Outlier Removal 

IQR<- IQR(as.numeric(Distance_Mat[,1]),na.rm = TRUE)

Cutoff<- as.numeric(quantile(Distance_Mat$V1,0.75,na.rm = TRUE)+IQR*1.5)

HotelDetail$Flag<- ifelse(HotelDetail$V1>Cutoff,"Incorrect","Correct")
Outliers_Final<- filter(HotelDetail,Flag=="Incorrect")
```

## Clustering 

After cleaning the data (outlier removal) now letâ€™s create a distance matrix i.e. distance of each hotel from every other hotel, I am doing this using the geosphere library in R.

```
#Distance Matrix for city 
Distance_Mat<- distm(HotelsLatLon[2:1],HotelsLatLon[2:1],fun = distHaversine)
Distance_Mat<- as.data.frame(Distance_Mat)
Distance_Mat[is.na(Distance_Mat)]<-0
DMat<- as.dist(Distance_Mat)

```
![](https://rvsshubhamhome.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dmat.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)

![](https://rvsshubhamhome.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dmat.png?w=456)


**Letâ€™s Create Clusters now.**

```
#Hierarchical Clustering
hc <- hclust(DMat, method="complete")
HotelCity_Valid$Clusters<- cutree(hc, h=AvgDist2)

```

In the above code snippet in the cutree function I have used a different cutoff distance for different cities. How I arrived at that distance is a different science altogether, in this case the cutoff distance is around 2 KMs which means that each cluster would be roughly of a diameter of 2 KMs.

This is how these different clusters look like when plotted

![](https://rvsshubhamhome.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/clusters.png?w=456)


How I named these localities? There was a system name tagged to each hotelâ€™s locality, I used the most frequent name in that cluster as the Cluster Name
