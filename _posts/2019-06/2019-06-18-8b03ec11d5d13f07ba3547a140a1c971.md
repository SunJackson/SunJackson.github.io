We’re a university full of energetic and enthusiastic minds, driven to challenge what’s expected, expand what we know, and learn from other inspiring, empowering thinkers.

**The opportunity:**

The Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University is one of the most cutting-edge teaching and research university facilities in the world. Subsequently, we are in a period of rapid growth, hiring world-class academics in the areas of:

artificial intelligence (AI)
data science, cybersecurity
creative technologies & human-computer interaction, and
organisational and social informatics.

The Faculty of Information Technology is establishing a new research group, The Laboratory for Dialogue Research (LDR) led by Professor Phil Cohen. The LDR has close partnerships with Monash’s new HCI Group, its renowned Centre for Data Science, the Engineering School, and with numerous universities in Australia and worldwide. Importantly, we plan to engage with interested industry, philanthropic, and government partners on problem, data, and tool selection and development of scalable approaches. LDR’s Director is Professor Phil Cohen, an AAAI Fellow and internationally known pioneer in natural language dialogue, multi-agent systems, and multimodal interaction.

We cordially invite the interest of outstanding academics who want to join this world-class team to deliver the highest quality teaching and research that will shape the future of AI for conversational assistants, human-robot interaction, customer service, and many other application domains.

Multiple Faculty Openings in LDR are available at a Level B Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor in North America), Level C Senior Lecturer (equivalent to Associate Professor in North America), and Level D Associate Professor (equivalent to Professor in North America) with a preference for expertise in the area of natural language processing (semantic parsing, generation).

Applications of interest from other areas of natural language processing or multimodal interaction that could contribute to dialogue research are also strongly encouraged.  The successful candidate will join a rapidly expanding multidisciplinary group in the above areas. When applying, please indicate your area of specialisation.
