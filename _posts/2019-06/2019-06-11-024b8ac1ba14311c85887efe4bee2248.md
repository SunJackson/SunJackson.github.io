**Functional time series prediction under partial observation of the future curve**

Providing reliable predictions is one of the fundamental topics in functional time series analysis. Existing functional time series methodology seeks to predict a complete future functional observation based on a set of observed functions. The problem of interest discussed here is how to advance prediction methodology to cases where partial information on the next trajectory is available, with the aim of improving prediction accuracy. The proposed method combines ‘next-interval’ prediction and fully functional regression prediction, so that the partially observed part can aid in producing a better guess for the unobserved part of the future curve. An automatic selection criterion based on minimizing the prediction error helps select unknown tuning parameters. Simulations indicate that the proposed method can outperform existing methods with respect to mean-square prediction error of the unobserved part, and its practical usefulness is illustrated in an analysis of environmental and traffic flow data.

**Cooperative neural networks (CoNN): Exploiting prior independence structure for improved classification**

We propose a new approach, called cooperative neural networks (CoNN), which uses a set of cooperatively trained neural networks to capture latent representations that exploit prior given independence structure. The model is more flexible than traditional graphical models based on exponential family distributions, but incorporates more domain specific prior structure than traditional deep networks or variational autoencoders. The framework is very general and can be used to exploit the independence structure of any graphical model. We illustrate the technique by showing that we can transfer the independence structure of the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to a cooperative neural network, CoNN-sLDA. Empirical evaluation of CoNN-sLDA on supervised text classification tasks demonstrates that the theoretical advantages of prior independence structure can be realized in practice -we demonstrate a 23\% reduction in error on the challenging MultiSent data set compared to state-of-the-art.

**Multimodal Transformer for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences**

Human language is often multimodal, which comprehends a mixture of natural language, facial gestures, and acoustic behaviors. However, two major challenges in modeling such multimodal human language time-series data exist: 1) inherent data non-alignment due to variable sampling rates for the sequences from each modality; and 2) long-range dependencies between elements across modalities. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT) to generically address the above issues in an end-to-end manner without explicitly aligning the data. At the heart of our model is the directional pairwise crossmodal attention, which attends to interactions between multimodal sequences across distinct time steps and latently adapt streams from one modality to another. Comprehensive experiments on both aligned and non-aligned multimodal time-series show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition, empirical analysis suggests that correlated crossmodal signals are able to be captured by the proposed crossmodal attention mechanism in MulT.

**Learning low-dimensional state embeddings and metastable clusters from time series data**

This paper studies how to find compact state embeddings from high-dimensional Markov state trajectories, where the transition kernel has a small intrinsic rank. In the spirit of diffusion map, we propose an efficient method for learning a low-dimensional state embedding and capturing the process’s dynamics. This idea also leads to a kernel reshaping method for more accurate nonparametric estimation of the transition function. State embedding can be used to cluster states into metastable sets, thereby identifying the slow dynamics. Sharp statistical error bounds and misclassification rate are proved. Experiment on a simulated dynamical system shows that the state clustering method indeed reveals metastable structures. We also experiment with time series generated by layers of a Deep-Q-Network when playing an Atari game. The embedding method identifies game states to be similar if they share similar future events, even though their raw data are far different.

**Clustering Multivariate Data using Factor Analytic Bayesian Mixtures with an Unknown Number of Components**

**Does It Make Sense? And Why? A Pilot Study for Sense Making and Explanation**

Introducing common sense to natural language understanding systems has received increasing research attention. It remains a fundamental question on how to evaluate whether a system has a sense making capability. Existing benchmarks measures commonsense knowledge indirectly and without explanation. In this paper, we release a benchmark to directly test whether a system can differentiate natural language statements that make sense from those that do not make sense. In addition, a system is asked to identify the most crucial reason why a statement does not make sense. We evaluate models trained over large-scale language modeling tasks as well as human performance, showing that there are different challenges for system sense making.

**User Profile Feature-Based Approach to Address the Cold Start Problem in Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Movie Recommendation**

A huge amount of user generated content related to movies is created with the popularization of web 2.0. With these continues exponential growth of data, there is an inevitable need for recommender systems as people find it difficult to make informed and timely decisions. Movie recommendation systems assist users to find the next interest or the best recommendation. In this proposed approach the authors apply the relationship of user feature-scores derived from user-item interaction via ratings to optimize the prediction algorithm’s input parameters used in the recommender system to improve the accuracy of predictions when there are less past user records. This addresses a major drawback in collaborative filtering, the cold start problem by showing an improvement of 8.4% compared to the base collaborative filtering algorithm. The user-feature generation and evaluation of the system is carried out using the ‘MovieLens 100k dataset’. The proposed system can be generalized to other domains as well.

**Disparate Vulnerability: on the Unfairness of Privacy Attacks Against Machine Learning**

A membership inference attack (MIA) against a machine learning model enables an attacker to determine whether a given data record was part of the model’s training dataset or not. Such attacks have been shown to be practical both in centralized and federated settings, and pose a threat in many privacy-sensitive domains such as medicine or law enforcement. In the literature, the effectiveness of these attacks is invariably reported using metrics computed across the whole population. In this paper, we take a closer look at the attack’s performance across different subgroups present in the data distributions. We introduce a framework that enables us to efficiently analyze the vulnerability of machine learning models to MIA. We discover that even if the accuracy of MIA looks no better than random guessing over the whole population, subgroups are subject to disparate vulnerability, i.e., certain subgroups can be significantly more vulnerable than others. We provide a theoretical definition for MIA vulnerability which we validate empirically both on synthetic and real data.

**Statistically Significant Discriminative Patterns Searching**

Discriminative pattern mining is an essential task of data mining. This task aims to discover patterns which occur more frequently in a class than other classes in a class-labeled dataset. This type of patterns is valuable in various domains such as bioinformatics, data classification. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, named SSDPS, to discover patterns in two-class datasets. The SSDPS algorithm owes its efficiency to an original enumeration strategy of the patterns, which allows to exploit some degrees of anti-monotonicity on the measures of discriminance and statistical significance. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the SSDPS algorithm is better than others. In addition, the number of generated patterns is much less than the number of other algorithms. Experiment on real data also shows that SSDPS efficiently detects multiple SNPs combinations in genetic data.

**A Survey of Natural Language Generation Techniques with a Focus on Dialogue Systems – Past, Present and Future Directions**

One of the hardest problems in the area of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence is automatically generating language that is coherent and understandable to humans. Teaching machines how to converse as humans do falls under the broad umbrella of Natural Language Generation. Recent years have seen unprecedented growth in the number of research articles published on this subject in conferences and journals both by academic and industry researchers. There have also been several workshops organized alongside top-tier NLP conferences dedicated specifically to this problem. All this activity makes it hard to clearly define the state of the field and reason about its future directions. In this work, we provide an overview of this important and thriving area, covering traditional approaches, statistical approaches and also approaches that use deep neural networks. We provide a comprehensive review towards building open domain dialogue systems, an important application of natural language generation. We find that, predominantly, the approaches for building dialogue systems use seq2seq or language models architecture. Notably, we identify three important areas of further research towards building more effective dialogue systems: 1) incorporating larger context, including conversation context and world knowledge; 2) adding personae or personality in the NLG system; and 3) overcoming dull and generic responses that affect the quality of system-produced responses. We provide pointers on how to tackle these open problems through the use of cognitive architectures that mimic human language understanding and generation capabilities.

**A Fast-Optimal Guaranteed Algorithm For Learning Sub-Interval Relationships in Time Series**

Traditional approaches focus on finding relationships between two entire time series, however, many interesting relationships exist in small sub-intervals of time and remain feeble during other sub-intervals. We define the notion of a sub-interval relationship (SIR) to capture such interactions that are prominent only in certain sub-intervals of time. To that end, we propose a fast-optimal guaranteed algorithm to find most interesting SIR relationship in a pair of time series. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of our method in climate science domain based on a real-world dataset along with its scalability scope and obtain useful domain insights.

**Incorporating Biological Knowledge with Factor Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Deep Learning**

While deep learning has achieved great success in many fields, one common criticism about deep learning is its lack of interpretability. In most cases, the hidden units in a deep neural network do not have a clear semantic meaning or correspond to any physical entities. However, model interpretability and explainability are crucial in many biomedical applications. To address this challenge, we developed the Factor Graph Neural Network model that is interpretable and predictable by combining probabilistic graphical models with deep learning. We directly encode biological knowledge such as Gene Ontology as a factor graph into the model architecture, making the model transparent and interpretable. Furthermore, we devised an attention mechanism that can capture multi-scale hierarchical interactions among biological entities such as genes and Gene Ontology terms. With parameter sharing mechanism, the unrolled Factor Graph Neural Network model can be trained with stochastic depth and generalize well. We applied our model to two cancer genomic datasets to predict target clinical variables and achieved better results than other traditional machine learning and deep learning models. Our model can also be used for gene set enrichment analysis and selecting Gene Ontology terms that are important to target clinical variables.

**Copula-based functional Bayes classification with principal components and partial least squares**

We present a new functional Bayes classifier that uses principal component (PC) or partial least squares (PLS) scores from the common covariance function, that is, the covariance function marginalized over groups. When the groups have different covariance functions, the PC or PLS scores need not be independent or even uncorrelated. We use copulas to model the dependence. Our method is semiparametric; the marginal densities are estimated nonparametrically by kernel smoothing and the copula is modeled parametrically. We focus on Gaussian and t-copulas, but other copulas could be used. The strong performance of our methodology is demonstrated through simulation, real data examples, and asymptotic properties.
