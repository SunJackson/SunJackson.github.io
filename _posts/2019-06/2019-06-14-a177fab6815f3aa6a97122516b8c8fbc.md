**At: Berkeley Lab**![](https://creative.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/05/Berkeley_Lab_Logo_Large.png)
**Location: Berkeley, CA****Web: www.lbl.gov****Position: Associate Laboratory Director for Computing Sciences Area**

**Apply here**.

Berkeley Lab has an exceptional opportunity for a dynamic and visionary leader to serve as the Associate Laboratory Director (ALD) for our world-class Computing Sciences Area. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to develop new directions for mathematics and computing across the sciences at Berkeley Lab, Department of Energy, and throughout the nation.

**About the Position**

Reporting to the Laboratory Director, the ALD for Computing Sciences has Laboratory-wide responsibility for providing leadership, stewardship and strategic vision for Berkeley National Lab’s Computing Sciences Area. The ALD oversees and collaborates with the Division Directors of two national user facilities – the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) – as well as with the Division Director of Computational Research, to ensure the success of the Laboratory’s multi-disciplinary short- and long-term scientific and operational goals. In particular, the ALD will develop and drive the strategy to enhance synergy among the Area’s divisions and user facilities, and to support integrated teams across other Areas at Berkeley Lab.

The ALD is responsible for strategic planning, people and operations leadership, research quality and integrity, and communication about Computing Sciences Area research. In addition, they will serve as the primary contact for DOE Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, act as a liaison to other external agencies and national laboratories, promote partnerships with academia and industry, and guide the development of externally sponsored basic research projects and programs consistent with the Laboratory’s overall vision and strategy.

Together with the other ALDs, they actively participate in institutional research and management initiatives, including our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accountability program, develop cross-Area research proposals, and actively shepherd these efforts through their life cycle. The ALD is also a key member of the Laboratory’s Senior Leadership Team, providing advice, counsel, and insight to the Laboratory Director and Deputy Laboratory Directors on the formulation and execution of Berkeley Lab’s strategic priorities and initiatives. With the other senior leaders, the ALD will be expected to actively support Lab-wide initiatives, especially our responsible stewardship of the Lab’s research, people and assets, and promote a diverse and welcoming culture at the Lab.

**About the Computing Sciences Area**

Berkeley Lab’s Computing Sciences Area is a world leader in applied mathematics, computer science, high-performance computing and networking. Its mission is to achieve transformational, breakthrough impacts in scientific domains through the discovery and use of advanced computational methods and systems and to make those instruments accessible to the broad scientific community. The Area receives more than $200 million of funding to support world-class research programs in applied mathematics, data science, computational science, and the operations and upgrades of the ESnet and NERSC. In keeping with the “team science” concept that is the hallmark of Berkeley Lab, this research is carried out across multiple scientific disciplines using the most advanced tools and instrumentation available.
