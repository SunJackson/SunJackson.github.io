Exploring categorical data with inspectdf
What’s `inspectdf` and what’s it for?
I often find myself viewing and reviewing dataframes throughout thecourse of an analysis, and a substantial amount of time can be spentrewriting the same code to do this. `inspectdf` is an R package designedto make common exploratory tools a bit more useful and easy to use.

In particular, it’s very powerful be able to quickly see the contents ofcategorical features. In this article, we’ll summarise how to use the`inspect_cat()` function from `inspectdf` for summarising andvisualising categorical columns.

First of all, you’ll need to have the `inspectdf` package installed. Youcan get it from github using

```
library(devtools)
install_github("alastairrushworth/inspectdf")

```

Then load the package in. We’ll also load `dplyr` for the `starwars`data and for the pipe `%>%`.

```
library(inspectdf)
library(dplyr)

# check out the starwars help file
?starwars

```

#### Tabular summaries using `inspect_cat()`

The `starwars` data that comes bundled with `dplyr` has 7 columns thathave character class, and is therefore a nice candidate for illustratingthe use of `inspect_cat`. We can see this quickly using the`inspect_types()` function from `inspectdf`.

```
starwars %>% inspect_types()

```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
## type cnt pcnt col_name 
## 
## 1 character 7 53.8 
## 2 list 3 23.1 
## 3 numeric 2 15.4 
## 4 integer 1 7.69 

```

Using `inspect_cat()` is very straightforward:

```
star_cat <- starwars %>% inspect_cat()
star_cat

```

```
## # A tibble: 7 x 5
## col_name cnt common common_pcnt levels 
## 
## 1 eye_color 15 brown 24.1 
## 2 gender 5 male 71.3 
## 3 hair_color 13 none 42.5 
## 4 homeworld 49 Naboo 12.6 
## 5 name 87 Ackbar 1.15 
## 6 skin_color 31 fair 19.5 
## 7 species 38 Human 40.2 

```

So what does this tell us? Each row in the tibble returned from`inspect_cat()` corresponds to each categorical column (`factor`,`logical` or `character`) in the `starwars` dataframe.

- The `cnt` column tells you how many unique levels there are for eachcolumn. For example, there are 15 unique entries in the `eye_color`column.

- The `common` column prints the most commonly occurring entry. Forexample, the most common `eye_color` is `brown`. The percentageoccurrence is 24.1% which is shown under `common_pcnt`.

- A full list of levels and occurrence frequency is provided in thelist column `levels`.


A table of relative frequencies of `eye_color` can be retrieved bytyping

```
star_cat$levels$eye_color

```

```
## # A tibble: 15 x 3
## value prop cnt
## 
## 1 brown 0.241 21
## 2 blue 0.218 19
## 3 yellow 0.126 11
## 4 black 0.115 10
## 5 orange 0.0920 8
## 6 red 0.0575 5
## 7 hazel 0.0345 3
## 8 unknown 0.0345 3
## 9 blue-gray 0.0115 1
## 10 dark 0.0115 1
## 11 gold 0.0115 1
## 12 green, yellow 0.0115 1
## 13 pink 0.0115 1
## 14 red, blue 0.0115 1
## 15 white 0.0115 1

```

There isn’t anything here that can’t be obtained by using the base`table()` function with some post-processing. `inspect_cat()` automatessome of that functionality and wraps it into a single, convenientfunction.

#### Visualising categorical columns with `show_plot()`

An important feature of `inspectdf` is the ability to visualisedataframe summaries. Visualising categories can be challenging, becausecategorical columns can be very rich and contain many unique levels. Asimple stacked barplot can be produced using `show_plot()`

```
star_cat %>% show_plot()

```

Like the `star_cat` tibble returned by `inspect_cat()`, each row of theplot is a single column, split by the relative frequency of occurrenceof each unique entry.

- Some of the bars are labelled, but in cases where the bars aresmall, the labels are not shown. If you encounter categoricalcolumns with really long strings, labels can be suppressedaltogether with `show_plot(text_labels = FALSE)`.

- Missing values or `NA`s are shown as gray bars. In this case, thereare quite a few `starwars` characters whose `homeworld` is notunknown or missing.


#### Combining rare entries with `show_plot()`

Some of the categorical columns like `name` seems to have a lot ofunique entries. We should expect this – names often are unique (oralmost) in a small dataset. If we scaled this analysis up to a datasetwith millions of rows, there would be so many names with very smallrelative frequencies that the name bars would be very difficult to see.`show_plot()` can help with this too!

```
star_cat %>% show_plot(high_cardinality = 1)

```

![](https://i1.wp.com/alastairrushworth.github.io/assets/images/inspect_cat_plot_2-1.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/alastairrushworth.github.io/assets/images/inspect_cat_plot_2-1.png?w=456&ssl=1)


By setting the argument `high_cardinality = 1` all entries that occur*only once* are combined into a single group labelled *highcardinality*. This makes it easier to see when some entries occur onlyonce (or extremely rarely).

- In the above, it’s now obvious that no two people in the `starwars`data share the same name, and that many come from a unique`homeworld` or `species`.

- By setting `high_cardinality = 2` or even greater, it’s possible togroup the ‘long-tail’ of rare categories even further. With largerdatasets, this becomes increasingly important for visualisation.

- A practical reason to combine rare entries, is plotting speed – itcan take a long time to render a plot with tens of thousands (ormore) unique bars! Using the `high_cardinality` argument can reducethis dramatically.


#### Playing with color options in `show_plot()`

It’s been pointed out that the default `ggplot` color theme isn’tparticularly friendly to color-blind audiences. A more color-blindfriendly theme isavailable by specifying `col_palette = 1`:

```
star_cat %>% show_plot(col_palette = 1)

```

![](https://i2.wp.com/alastairrushworth.github.io/assets/images/inspect_cat_plot_3-1.png?w=456&ssl=1)


I’m also quite fond of the 80s theme by choosing `col_palette = 2`:

```
star_cat %>% show_plot(col_palette = 2)

```

![](https://i2.wp.com/alastairrushworth.github.io/assets/images/inspect_cat_plot_4-1.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/alastairrushworth.github.io/assets/images/inspect_cat_plot_4-1.png?w=456&ssl=1)


There are 5 palettes at the moment, so have a play around. Note that thecolor palettes have not yet hit the CRAN version of `inspectdf` – thatwill come soon in an update, but for now you can get them from thegithub version of the package using the code at the start of thearticle.

Any feedback is welcome! Find me on twitter atrushworth_a or write a githubissue.
