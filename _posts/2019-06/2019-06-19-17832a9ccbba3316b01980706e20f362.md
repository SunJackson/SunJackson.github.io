It is usually said, that forâ€“ and while-loops should be avoided in R. I was curious about just how the different alternatives compare in terms of speed.

The first loop is perhaps the worst I can think of â€“ the return vector is initialized without type and length so that the memory is constantly being allocated.

The second for loop is with preallocated size of the return vector.

I have noticed I use sapply() quite a lot, but I think not once have I used vapply() We will nonetheless look at both

And because I am a tidyverse-fanboy we also loop at map_dbl().

We test the functions using a vector of random doubles and evaluate the runtime with microbenchmark.

The results are listed in table and figure below.

|expr|min|lq|mean|median|uq|max|neval
|------
|for_loop()|8.440|9.7305|10.736446|10.2995|10.9840|26.976|500|
|for_loop_vector()|10.912|12.1355|13.468312|12.7620|13.8455|37.432|500|
|purrr::map_dbl()|22.558|24.3740|25.537080|25.0995|25.6850|71.550|500|
|sapply()|15.966|17.3490|18.483216|18.1820|18.8070|59.289|500|

The clear winner is vapply() and for-loops are rather slow. However, if we have a very low number of iterations, even the worst for-loop isnâ€™t too bad:

|expr|min|lq|mean|median|uq|max|neval
|------
|for_loop()|5.992|7.1185|9.670106|7.9015|9.3275|70.955|500|
|for_loop_vector()|5.743|7.0160|9.398098|7.9575|9.2470|40.899|500|
|purrr::map_dbl()|22.020|24.1540|30.565362|25.1865|27.5780|157.452|500|
|sapply()|15.456|17.4010|22.507534|18.3820|20.6400|203.635|500|
|vapply()|6.966|8.1610|10.127994|8.6125|9.7745|66.973|500|
