### AI / Machine Learning Summer Sale

For the next week, all my Deep Learning and AI courses are available for just $9.99! (In addition to other courses on the site for the next few days)

For those of you who have been around for some time, you know that this sale doesn’t come around very often – just a few times per year. If you’ve been on the fence about getting a course, NOW is the time to do so. Get it now – save it for later.

For my courses, please use the coupons below (included in the links), or if you want, enter the coupon code: JUN2019.

As usual, if you want to know what order to take my courses in, check out the lecture “What order should I take your courses in?” in the Appendix of any of my courses (including the free Numpy course).

For prerequisite courses (math, stats, Python programming) and all other courses, follow the links at the bottom for sales of up to 90% off!

Since ALL courses on Udemy on sale, if you want any course not listed here, just click the general (site-wide) link, and search for courses from that page.
