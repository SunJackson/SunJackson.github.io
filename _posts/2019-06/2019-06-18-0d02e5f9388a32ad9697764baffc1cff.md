I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve become a big fan of the {logspline} package over the past ~6 months and decided to wrap up a manual ggplot2 plotting process (well, it was at least in an RStudio snippet) into a small {ggplot2} `Stat` to make it easier to visualize various components of the fitted model.

If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re new to logspline density estimation this paper by Stone, Hansen, Kooperberg, and Truong is a pretty accessible introduction to the methodology and the (primary) algorithm used in the {logspline} package.

If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re already a user of the {logspline} package have have either been just using the package√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s base S3 plot function but wanted the functionality in {ggplot2} this was pretty much designed for you.

If you hit up https://git.rud.is/hrbrmstr/gglogspline there are links to all your fav social code collaboration services plus installation instructions. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a single `Stat` √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù `stat_logspline()` √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù which does all the hard work. By default it will make `y` the `stat(density)` computed field but there are other computed fields you can use as well:

- `count`: computed count estimates (similar to `ggplot2::stat_density()`)

- `probs`: distribution function

- `survival`: survival function

- `hazard` : hazard function


You can take a look at the (light) comparison between `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`, `ggalt::geom_bkde()`, and `gglogspline::stat_logspline()` below (or use this link to bust the iframe):





### FIN

For √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgeneral purpose√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ density estimation you can likely still rely on `stat_density()` but after you dig into the background of logspline and try it out in some appropriate use-cases you may grow to like it as much as I have.

The package itself is super-small and focused. One reason for that is it may be helpful for those who want to create or customize their own ggplot2 `Stat`s. (I think I forgot to change the license to MIT before this post so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll rectify that ASAP; I default to AGPL in a fairly pathetic attempt to stop skeezy cybersecurity startups √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù pretty much 99% of them √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù from stealing code without giving back to the community).

As usual, kick the tyres and file issues or PRs as you feel moved (and wherever you feel comfortable social coding).
