A user of the `{ggalt}` package recently posted a question about how to add points to a `geom_dumbbell()` plot. For now, this is not something you can do with `geom_dumbbell()` but with a bit of data wrangling you can do this in a pretty straightforward manner with just your data and ggplot2. The example below uses 3 values per category but it should scale to `n` values per category (though after a certain `n` you should reconsider the use of a dummbell chart in favour of a more appropriate way to visualize the message you’re trying to convey).

Here’s the setup:

```
library(hrbrthemes)
library(tidyverse)

tibble(
 val1 = c(3, 2, 4),
 val2 = c(1, 4, 5),
 val3 = c(5, 8, 6),
 cat = factor(month.name[1:3], levels = rev(month.name[1:3]))
) -> xdf

```

Three values per category. The approach is pretty straightforward:

- reshape the data frame & get min value so you can draw an eye-tracking line (this is one geom)

- reshape the data frame & get min/max category values so you can draw the segment (this is another geom)

- reshape the data frame & plot the points


I’ve put ^^ notes near each ggplot2 geom:

```
ggplot() +
 # reshape the data frame & get min value so you can draw an eye-tracking line (this is one geom)
 geom_segment(
 data = gather(xdf, measure, val, -cat) %>% 
 group_by(cat) %>% 
 top_n(-1) %>% 
 slice(1) %>%
 ungroup(),
 aes(x = 0, xend = val, y = cat, yend = cat),
 linetype = "dotted", size = 0.5, color = "gray80"
 ) +
 # reshape the data frame & get min/max category values so you can draw the segment (this is another geom)
 geom_segment(
 data = gather(xdf, measure, val, -cat) %>% 
 group_by(cat) %>% 
 summarise(start = range(val)[1], end = range(val)[2]) %>% 
 ungroup(),
 aes(x = start, xend = end, y = cat, yend = cat),
 color = "gray80", size = 2
 ) +
 # reshape the data frame & plot the points
 geom_point(
 data = gather(xdf, measure, value, -cat),
 aes(value, cat, color = measure), 
 size = 4
 ) +
 # i just extended the scale a bit + put axis on top; choose aesthetics that work 
 # for you
 scale_x_comma(position = "top", limits = c(0, 10)) +
 scale_color_ipsum(name = "A real legend title") +
 labs(
 x = "Description of the value", y = NULL,
 title = "A good plot title"
 ) +
 theme_ipsum_rc(grid = "X") +
 theme(legend.position = "top")

```

And, here’s the result:
