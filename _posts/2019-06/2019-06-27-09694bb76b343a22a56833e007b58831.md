This title might sounds a little bit weird so letâ€™s being with a little bit of context. It all started with this issue on the `{golem}` package, which reflects a discussion we previously had inside the team. Also, two weeks ago, I received a tweet on the very same subject, which can be summarised as such: **â€œshould we use**`**shinyApp()**`**or**`**runApp()**`**when deploying to production?â€�**

`{golem}` has a function called `run_app()`, which, in its original implementation by Vincent, relies on calling `runApp()` on the two files contained in the `inst/` folder of the package. But here comes the issue â€” `**runApp()**`**canâ€™t be used with RStudio products (Shiny Server, Connect & Shinyapps.io)**, as it returns an error `Can't call runApp()` from within `runApp()`. The previous workaround was to use `shinyApp(...)` in the `app.R` file, but I like things to be stable so having various solutions didnâ€™t seem like the best answer.

Two questions arise from that: 

Why on earth a `run_app()` function? Well, because it allows to deploy easily through command line. Using a `run_app()` function allow more flexibility, if we succeed to design it to take parameters and to pass it to the app. For example, in Docker, we could use environment variables as function parameters. A flexible `run_app()` function would also allow to change the behaviour of the app without having to tweak the `app.R` file weâ€™re using for RStudio Products. Or, as you will see in this very blog post, a `run_app()` function with parameters can also be used to change the behaviour of our local app ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 

Ok, so that was the story behind `run_app()`. But why on earth this first implementation with `runApp()`? Youâ€™ll see in a minute why one would choose that function ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 But, TL;DR, `runApp` is able to use local options defined into the function. 

And these three functions (the one from the title) do not have the same behaviour, depending on where they are used: 

- `runApp()` doesnâ€™t work on RStudio products, but is the only way Docker and local calls can access options passed to the `run_app()` function.

- `shinyApp()` and `shinyAppDir()` works likewise wherever you use them.

- RStudio production do not handle â€œlocalâ€� options defined in the `run_app()` function.

Thereâ€™s a fourth way, the one implemented in `{golem}`, which is fit for all scenario ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

## Several ways to launch a Shiny App

1. `runApp()` (old implementation of `{golem}`), which is a wrapper around`shiny::runApp(system.file("app", package = "aaaaaa"))`.

1. `shinyApp()`, which is `shiny::shinyApp(ui = app_ui(), server = app_server)`, the solution created by `golem::add_rstudioconnect_file()` and friends. 

1. `shinyAppDir()`, which is `shinyAppDir( system.file("app", package = "aaaaaa") )` â€” a necessary workaround for Shiny server if you wanted to call the `app/` folder through the old implementation of `{golem}`. 


Note: there is also `shinyAppFile()`, but its inner behaviour is the same as `shinyAppDir()`, so itâ€™s not benchmarked here.

### One naive implementation

**What we could have done there is simply leaving things open for the end user**, so that they have to chose the best implementation for their deployment use case. By doing something like: 

```
run_app <- function(
 with = c("shinyApp", "runApp", "shinyAppDir")
) {
 with <- match.arg(with)
 if (with == "shinyApp"){
 shiny::shinyApp(ui = app_ui(), server = app_server)
 } else if (with == "runApp") {
 shiny::runApp(system.file("app", package = "aaaa"))
 } else if (with == "shinyAppDir") {
 shiny::shinyAppDir(system.file("app", package = "aaaa"))
 }
}
```

This might be the best answer as it leaves the choice to the user, but the question is still open: **what function should I use for my deployment**?

Letâ€™s keep this function and use it for our benchmark.

### Side node

If I refer to `?shinyApp`: 

> 
You generally shouldnâ€™t need to use these functions to create/run applications; they are intended for interoperability purposes.
https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.3.2/shinyApp.html

So according to the documentation we should rarely call `shinyApp()` directly, and use only `runApp()` instead. But using `runApp()` is impossible on RStudio platforms, as they print an error that looks like this: 

```
Loading aaaa
Error in shiny::runApp(system.file("app", package = "aaaa")) :
 Can't call `runApp()` from within `runApp()`. If your application code contains `runApp()`, please remove it.
Calls: runApp ... eval -> eval -> ..stacktraceon.. -> run_app -> 
```

### Side note 2 

Iâ€™ve tried to make this benchmark as reproducible as possible, so **feel free to run it and see if you get the same results** ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 

The package is named â€œaaaaâ€� (so it wonâ€™t conflict with any other package (I hope), and can be found here. It contains the golem skeleton with the functions listed below.

## Looking for the best implementation

Anyway, letâ€™s try to find the best implementation. The idea is that our implementation of `run_app()` should: 

- **work on the maximum number of services** (Locally + Docker + RStudio products), and this with minimal tweaking (one implementation to rule them all would be best).

- **Be able to read options from the global environment**, so that for example we can use the global `golem.app.prod` variable from inside the server and UI, or global options / env var defined in the service.

- Be able to read **options from the local function environment**, so we can pass arguments to the `run_app()` function.


### Benchmark conditions

- Previous version of `{golem}` (0.0.1.600)


#### Content of the app_ui function:

```
app_ui <- function() {
 tagList(
 fluidPage(
 h1("aaaa"), 
 h3( "global options:" ), 
 verbatimTextOutput("global"),
 h3( "function options:" ), 
 verbatimTextOutput("shinycall")
 )
 )
}
```

#### Content of the app_server function:

```
app_server <- function(input, output,session) {
 output$global <- renderPrint({
 # Global options
 getOption('golem.pkg.name')
 })
 output$shinycall <- renderPrint({
 # Local options
 getOption('shinycall')
 })
}
```

### Various run_app implementations

Weâ€™ll use this function to benchmark the three functions (`shinyApp()`, `runApp()`, and `shinyAppDir()`.

```
run_app <- function(
 with = c("shinyApp", "runApp", "shinyAppDir")
) {
 with <- match.arg(with)
 # Here, we set local options so we can pass 
 # arguments to the run_app() function
 options("shinycall" = with)
 on.exit(
 options("shinycall" = NULL)
 )
 if (with == "shinyApp"){
 shiny::shinyApp(ui = app_ui(), server = app_server)
 } else if (with == "runApp") {
 shiny::runApp(system.file("app", package = "aaaa"))
 } else {
 shiny::shinyAppDir(system.file("app", package = "aaaa"))
 }
}
```

#### In our results, runApp is:

```
run_app( "runApp" )
```

#### shinyApp is: 

```
run_app( "shinyApp" )
```

#### shinyAppDir is

```
run_app( "shinyAppDir" )
```

## Launch contexts

### Local launch 

You can run this in your console, here in RStudio.

```
# Set options here
options( "golem.pkg.name" = "aaa")

# Detach all loaded packages and clean your environment
golem::detach_all_attached()
# rm(list=ls(all.names = TRUE))

# Document and reload your package
golem::document_and_reload()

# Run the application
aaaa::run_app(with = "runApp")

```

### The Dockerfile for local test is

```
FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.6.0
RUN R -e 'install.packages("remotes")'
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_github("r-lib/remotes", ref = "97bbf81")'
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_cran("shiny")'
COPY aaaa_*.tar.gz /app.tar.gz
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_local("/app.tar.gz")'
EXPOSE 80
CMD R -e "options('shiny.port'=1234,shiny.host='0.0.0.0', 'golem.pkg.name' = 'aaa');aaaa::run_app( 'runApp' )" # also with shinyApp & shinyAppDir
```

You can find this `Dockerfile` in the `inst/dockerfilelocal` folder of the `golem4bench` repo. Before launching it,**you have to document, and build your package** with `devtools::build(path = "inst/dockerfilelocal/")`, 

The full thing can be launched with:

```
R -e "devtools::build(path = 'inst/dockerfilelocal/')" \
 && cd inst/dockerfilelocal/ \
 && docker build -t aaa . \
 && docker run --name aaaa -p 1234:1234 -d aaa \
 && sleep 2 \
 && open http://0.0.0.0:1234 
```

Then, stay in the folder, change the `"runApp"` arg in the Dockerfile to `"shinyApp"`, **rebuild and relaunch** from the `docker build` line. Then again with `"shinyAppDir"`. Of course, donâ€™t forget to `docker kill aaa && docker rm aaa` between each iteration.

### RStudio products 1/2: the app.R script

```
pkgload::load_all()
options( "golem.pkg.name" = "aaa" )
run_app( "runApp" ) # also with shinyApp & shinyAppDir
```

Each three versions (i.e the three versions of `run_app()`) of this file will be deployed to: 

- **local Shiny Server** (copied inside the Docker)

- **ThinkR internal RStudio Connect** (sent with `rsconnect::deployApp()`)

- **ThinkRâ€™s shinyapps.io account** (sent with `rsconnect::deployApp()`)


**This file should be put at the root of your package.**

### RStudio products 2/2: Setting a Shiny server for testing

This Dockerfile can be found in the `inst/dockerfileshinyserver` folder of the package.

```
FROM rocker/shiny:3.6.0
RUN R -e 'install.packages("remotes")'
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_github("r-lib/remotes", ref = "97bbf81")'
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_cran("shiny")'
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install libssl-dev libxml2-dev -y
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_cran("attachment")'
RUN R -e 'remotes::install_github("thinkr-open/golem")'
COPY . /srv/shiny-server/aaaa
RUN cd /srv/shiny-server/aaaa && R -e "attachment::install_from_description()"
```

From the root of the package:

```
mv inst/dockerfileshinyserver/Dockerfile Dockerfile \
 && docker build -t plop . \
 && docker run --name plop -p 3838:3838 -d plop \
 && sleep 2 \
 && open http://0.0.0.0:3838/aaaa
```

Then, change for `"shinyApp"` and `"shinyAppDir"` in the `app.R` file, then rerun the `docker build`. Donâ€™t forget to kill & rm files between each iteration, and to `mv` back the Dockerfile where it belongs.

## Results

Global options are the one defined outside of `run_app()`, local options are the one defined inside the `run_app()`.

So to sum up : 

- Docker containers donâ€™t get local options from the functions unless called with `runApp()`. Which you can verify with running in any terminal: `R -e "options('shiny.port'=1234,shiny.host='0.0.0.0', 'golem.pkg.name' = 'aaa');aaaa::run_app( 'runApp' )"`

- `runApp()` fails on RStudio Product. 

- RStudio products donâ€™t get local options with any solution (weâ€™ll see in a minute thatâ€™s because we canâ€™t use `runApp()`.


## Where do we go from there?

So, why this different behaviours? Actually, itâ€™s because of what `shinyApp()` and `shinyAppDir()` return, compared to `runApp()`. If we look at the source code of `shinyApp()`, the last line of code looks like this:

```
> shiny::shinyApp
function (ui = NULL, server = NULL, onStart = NULL, options = list(), 
 uiPattern = "/", enableBookmarking = NULL) 
{
 
 [...]

 structure(list(httpHandler = httpHandler, serverFuncSource = serverFuncSource, 
 onStart = onStart, options = options, appOptions = appOptions), 
 class = "shiny.appobj")
}


```

We can see that the last thing returned by the function is a structure of class `shiny.appobj`, whereas the `runApp()` returns a running process. So the â€œlaunchâ€� of the app with `shinyApp()` is not the same the the one from `runApp()`â€” the first returns an object, while the second returns a process. So the launch of the app, with `shinyApp()`, is actually done with `print.shiny.appobj`. Which is why if you do `a <- shinyAppDir(appDir = "inst/app/")`, youâ€™ll not get the app running until you try to print `a`. Which also explains why the local options (defined inside the function) are not read: with `shinyApp()`, the function does return an object, so the function has ended, and the options defined there are not accessible anymore. 

Why is it a good news? Letâ€™s have a look at `shiny:::print.shiny.appobj`:

```
> shiny:::print.shiny.appobj
function (x, ...) 
{
 opts <- x$options %OR% list()
 opts <- opts[names(opts) %in% c("port", "launch.browser", 
 "host", "quiet", "display.mode", "test.mode")]
 args <- c(list(quote(x)), opts)
 do.call("runApp", args)
}


```

So here the cool thing is that we can hack the `x` passed to the `print` method to add `golem.options` inside it, i.e. in the `appOptions` of the app object. Hence:

```
with_golem_options <- function(app, golem_opts){
 app$appOptions$golem_options <- golem_opts
 app
}
```

and

```
run_app <- function(...) {
 with_golem_options(
 app = shinyApp(ui = app_ui(), server = app_server), 
 golem_opts = list(...)
 )
}
```

And with a full app: 

```
library(shiny)

options("golem.app.name" = "aaa")

get_golem_options <- function(which = NULL){
 if (is.null(which)){
 getShinyOption("golem_options")
 } else {
 getShinyOption("golem_options")[[which]]
 }
}

with_golem_options <- function(app, golem_opts){
 app$appOptions$golem_options <- golem_opts
 app
}

app_ui <- function() {
 tagList(
 fluidPage(
 verbatimTextOutput("all"),
 verbatimTextOutput("opt"), 
 verbatimTextOutput("glob")
 )
 )
}


app_server <- function(input, output,session) {
 
 output$all <- renderPrint({ get_golem_options() })
 output$opt <- renderPrint({ get_golem_options("a") })
 output$glob <- renderPrint({ getOption("golem.app.name") })
}

run_app <- function(...) {
 with_golem_options(
 app = shinyApp(ui = app_ui(), server = app_server), 
 golem_opts = list(...)
 )
}

run_app(a = "pouet", b = "bing")
```

And the good news isâ€¦ it works everywhere ![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f918.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f918.png?w=456&ssl=1)


So thanks to this little hack, you are now able to use the `run_app()` function from `{golem}` everywhere. And now, when you build your package, you can use arguments with the `run_app()` function, and use them with `get_golem_options()`. Global options are, as usual, available with `getOptions()`.

The other little cool hack? When you generate an app.R file for RStudio products with `golem::add_rstudioconnect_file`, `golem::add_shinyappsio_file`, or `golem::add_shinyserver_file`, we left a small `ShinyApp` in a comment, so you can use the nice blue button to deploy in just one click (yes, apparently it seems that every time RStudio sees a `ShinyApp` in the text, it shows this little button ![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
