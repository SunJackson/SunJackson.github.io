**Apply here**.

The Yale School of Management seeks applicants in the field of quantitative marketing for a tenure-track faculty position at the rank of Assistant Professor. 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree (or will earn the degree within one semester from the start of the appointment) in Quantitative Marketing or a related field such as Economics, Computer Science or Statistics. We are seeking applications from graduating students, post-docs and others who show exceptional promise.

Economics: Industrial Organization and Applied Microeconomics
Computer Science: Big Data, Machine Learning including Deep Learning, Unstructured Data involving text, images, video and other media

For those outside of marketing, relevant substantive areas include (but are not restricted to) advertising, recommendation systems, user behavior in online environments. The quality of research and the potential of the candidate to do marketing-relevant research is more important than an exact match with the above-mentioned topics.

The selected candidate will teach graduate- and/or PhD-level courses and advice and mentor students, while conducting high-quality research, representing early demonstration of intellectual leadership in their area of study.
