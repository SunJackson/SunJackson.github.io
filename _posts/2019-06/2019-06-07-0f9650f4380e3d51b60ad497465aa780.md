(TL;DR: Start with two vectors with equal numbers of elements. Multiplythem element-wise. Sum the results. This is the dot product.)

Hmmm…this is a tricky one!
Uhhh…did you know that Kendrick Lamar’s stage name used to be “K.Dot”?

Lasttime,we learnt **how to add vectors**. It’s time to learn about dot products!

Let’s define two vectors:


Let’s multiply these vectors element-wise. We’ll take the firstelements of our vectors and multiply them:


Let’s take the second elements and multiply them:


Now add the element-wise products:


This, my friends, is the **dot product** of our vectors.

More generally, if we have an arbitrary vector ofelements and another arbitrary vector also ofelements, then the dot product is:


The dot product is equivalent to. Let’s come back to this next timewhen we talk about **matrix multiplication**.

## What is that angular ‘E’ looking thing?

For anyone who doesn’t know how to read the dot product equation, let’sdissect its right-hand side!

 is the uppercase form of the Greek letter ‘sigma’. In thiscontext, means ‘sum’. So we know that we’ll need to add somethings.

We have and . In an earlierpost, we learnt that this refers to the th element of some vector. Sowe can refer to the first element of our vector as. We notice that also shares the same subscript . Sowe know that whenever we refer to the second element in (i.e.), we will be referring to the second element in (i.e.).

We notice that is next to . Sowe’re going to be multiplying elements of our vectors which occur in thesame position, .

We see that below our uppercase sigma there is a little . We alsonotice that there is a little above it. These mean “Let. Keep incrementing until you reach ”.

What is ? It’s the number of elements in our vectors!

If we expand the right-hand side, we get:


This looks somewhat similar to the equation from the example earlier:


Easy! These are the mechanics of dot products.

## What the hell does this all mean anyway?

For a deeper understanding of dot products (which is unfortunatelybeyond me right at this moment!) please refer to this video:




The entire series in the playlist is so beautifully done. They aremesmerising!

Let’s define two vectors:

```
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)

```

We can find the dot product of these two vectors using the `%*%`operator:

```
## [,1]
## [1,] 32

```

What does R do if we simply multiply one vector by the other?

This is the **element-wise product**! If the dot product is simply the sumof the element-wise product, then `x %*% y` is equivalent to doing this:

In our previous posts, R allowed us to multiply vectors of differentlengths. Notice how R doesn’t allow us to calculate the dot product ofvectors with different lengths:

```
x <- c(1, 2)
y <- c(3, 4, 5)

x %*% y

```

This is the exception that gets raised:

> 
Error in x %*% y : non-conformable arguments


We have learnt the mechanics of calculating dot products. We can nowfinally move onto matrices. Ooooooh yeeeeeah.
