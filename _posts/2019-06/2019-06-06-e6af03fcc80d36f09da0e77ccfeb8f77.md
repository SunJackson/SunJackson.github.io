Hi, everyone! Do you feel the summeR in the air?It’s the ideal time for our 10th MilanoR Meeting!

A MilanoR meeting is an occasion to bring together R users in the Milano area to share knowledge and experiences. The meeting is a free event, open to everybody. The meeting consists of some R talks and a free buffet + networking time.

This time some excellent speakers are joining us to explore two different fields, **Information retrieval** and **Strategic Price Positioning.**

Our first guest is **Goran S. Milovanović,**senior Data scientist at Wikidata and Manager of DataKolektiv consultancy firm; Goran will show how he works and deals with the most complex datasets now present (WikiData and Wikiktionary), blending together **Natural Language Processing**, **Text Mining** and **Semantic Web Technologies**. Goran will also introduce us to the {newsrivr} package – an R wrapper around the Newsriver API – to conduct news search and collect text corpora.

Then, **Alberto Oltolini** (Data Scientist at Campari) and **Edoardo Oliveri** (Data Scientist at SDG Group) will focus on **Machine Learning** and its application in **Strategic Price Positioning**. Together they will show us how to build a machine learning model that can drive strategic business decisions**,**guiding you through the****definition of the right pricing strategy.

So, are you up for some good time togetheR? We certainly are!

## —— FAQ

### **Can i know something more about the talks?**

##### Information Retrieval: Semantic Web Technologies and Wikidata from R

Semantic Web databases and technologies provide powerful means to improve upon the existing data sets and methods in Data Science. Goran will show us an use case designed to demonstrate a number of critical problems in data acquisition, transformation, and matching from a knowledge database; he will try to enhance a topic model of a technology businesses related news text corpus by matching the most important concepts present in it against Wikidata entities. He will also present a gift: the {newsrivr} package – an R wrapper around the Newsriver API – to conduct news search and collect text corpora, developed by Mike Page for the purposes of the projects that we will discuss in this talk.

##### *How Advanced Analytics may support strategic price positioning*

CPGs are usually willing to increase profitability of their products through a raise in gross profit margin rather than sold quantity. This strategy, may be simply pursued through a price increase or a discount reduction that may result in a decrease of sold quantity with unexpected effects on gross margin. Advanced Analytics is able to compute a machine learning model able to predict sold quantity given price, along with other endogenous variables, to determine a proper pricing strategy.

##### Then, as always, free food and chat <3
