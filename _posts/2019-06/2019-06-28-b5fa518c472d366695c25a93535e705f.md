For reading files in, youâ€™ll need to decide on *how* you want them to be read in. The options are:

1. Read all the datasets directly into the Global Environment as individual data frames with a â€œseparate existenceâ€� and separate names.

1. Read all the datasets into a single list, where each data frame is a member of that list.


The first option is best if you are **unlikely** to run similar operations on all the data frames at the same time. You may for instance want to do this if the data sets that you are reading in are structurally different from each other, and that you are planning to manipulate them separately.

The second option will be best if you are likely to manipulate all the data frames at the same time, where for instance you may run on the list of data frames `map()` with `drop_na()` as an argument to remove missing values for all of the data frames at the same time. The benefit of reading your multiple data sets into a list is that you will have a much cleaner workspace (Global Environment). However, there is a minor and almost negligible inconvenience accessing individual data frames, as you will need to go into a list and pick out the right member of the list (e.g. doing something like `list_of_dfs[3]`).

### Method 1A: Read all sheets in Excel into Global Environment

So letâ€™s begin! This method will read all the sheets within a specified Excel file and load them into the Global Environment, using variable names of your own choice. For simplicity, I will use the original Excel sheet names as the variable names.

The first thing to do is to specify the file path to the Excel file:

```
wb_source <- "../datasets/test-excel/test-excel.xlsx"
```

You can then run `readxl::excel_sheets()` to extract the sheet names in that Excel file, and save it as a character type vector.

```
# Extract the sheet names as a character string vector
wb_sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(wb_source) 

print(wb_sheets)
```

```
## [1] "setosa" "versicolor" "virginica"
```

The next step is to iterate through the sheet names (saved in `wb_sheets`) using `map()`, and within each iteration use `assign()` (base) and `read_xlsx()` (from **readxl**) to load each individual sheet into the Global Environment, giving each one a variable name. Hereâ€™s the code:

```
# Load everything into the Global Environment
wb_sheets %>%
 purrr::map(function(sheet){ # iterate through each sheet name
 assign(x = sheet,
 value = readxl::read_xlsx(path = wb_source, sheet = sheet),
 envir = .GlobalEnv)
})
```

This is what my work space looks like: ![](https://i0.wp.com/martinctc.github.io/blog/images/import-excel.PNG?w=80%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

Note that `map()` always returns a list, but in this case we do not need a list returned and only require the â€œside effectsâ€�, i.e. the objects being read in to be assigned to the Global Environment. If you prefer you can use `lapply()` instead of `map()`, which for this purpose doesnâ€™t make a big practical difference.

Also, `assign()` allows you to assign a value to a name in an environment, where weâ€™ve specified the following as arguments:

- **x**: `sheet` as the variable name

- **value**: The actual data from the sheet we read in. Here, we use `readxl::read_xlsx()` for reading in specific sheets from the Excel file, where you simply specify the file path and the sheet name as the arguments.

- **envir**: `.GlobalEnv` as the environment


### Method 1B: Read all CSV files in directory into Global Environment

The method for reading CSV files into a directory is slightly different, as youâ€™ll need to find a way to identify or create a character vector of names of all the files that you want to load into R. To do this, weâ€™ll use `list.files()`, which produces a character vector of the names of files or directories in the named directory:

```
file_path <- "../datasets/test-excel/"

file_path %>% list.files()
```

```
## [1] "test-excel-setosa.csv" "test-excel-versicolor.csv"
## [3] "test-excel-virginica.csv" "test-excel.xlsx"
```

We only want CSV files in this instance, so weâ€™ll want to do a bit of string manipulation (using `str_detect()` from **stringr** â€“ again, from **tidyverse**) to get only the names that end with the extension â€œ.csvâ€�. Letâ€™s pipe this along:

```
file_path %>%
 list.files() %>%
 .[str_detect(., ".csv")] -> csv_file_names

csv_file_names
```

```
## [1] "test-excel-setosa.csv" "test-excel-versicolor.csv"
## [3] "test-excel-virginica.csv"
```

The next part is similar to what weâ€™ve done earlier, using `map()`. Note that apart from replacing the `value` argument with `read_csv()` (or you can use `fread()` to return a **data.table** object rather than a **tibble**), I also removed the file extension in the `x` argument so that the variable names would not contain the actual characters â€œ.csvâ€�:

```
# Load everything into the Global Environment
csv_file_names %>%
 purrr::map(function(file_name){ # iterate through each file name
 assign(x = str_remove(file_name, ".csv"), # Remove file extension ".csv"
 value = read_csv(paste0(file_path, file_name)),
 envir = .GlobalEnv)
})
```

### Method 2A: Read all sheets in Excel into a list

Reading sheets into a list is actually easier than to read it into the Global Environment, as `map()` returns a list and you wonâ€™t have to use `assign()` or specify a variable name. Recall that `wb_source` holds the path of the Excel file, and `wb_sheets` is a character vector of all the sheet names in the Excel file:

```
# Load everything into the Global Environment
wb_sheets %>%
 purrr::map(function(sheet){ # iterate through each sheet name
 readxl::read_xlsx(path = wb_source, sheet = sheet)
}) -> df_list_read # Assign to a list
```

You can then use `map()` again to run operations across all members of the list, and even chain operations within it:

```
df_list_read %>%
 map(~select(., Petal.Length, Species) %>%
 head())
```

```
## [[1]]
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
## Petal.Length Species
## 
## 1 1.4 setosa 
## 2 1.4 setosa 
## 3 1.3 setosa 
## 4 1.5 setosa 
## 5 1.4 setosa 
## 6 1.7 setosa 
## 
## [[2]]
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
## Petal.Length Species 
## 
## 1 4.7 versicolor
## 2 4.5 versicolor
## 3 4.9 versicolor
## 4 4 versicolor
## 5 4.6 versicolor
## 6 4.5 versicolor
## 
## [[3]]
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
## Petal.Length Species 
## 
## 1 6 virginica
## 2 5.1 virginica
## 3 5.9 virginica
## 4 5.6 virginica
## 5 5.8 virginica
## 6 6.6 virginica
```

### Method 2B: Read all CSV files in directory into a list

At this point youâ€™ve probably gathered how you can adapt the code to read CSV files into a list, but letâ€™s cover this for comprehensiveness. No `assign()` needed, and only run `read_csv()` within the `map()` function, iterating through the file names:

```
# Load everything into the Global Environment
csv_file_names %>%
 purrr::map(function(file_name){ # iterate through each file name
 read_csv(paste0(file_path, file_name))
 
}) -> df_list_read2 # Assign to a list
```
