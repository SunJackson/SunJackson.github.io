Lately I’ve been interested in trying to cluster documents, and to find similar documents based on their contents.In this blog post, I will use Seneca’s *Moral letters to Lucilius*and compute the pairwise cosine similarity of his 124 letters.Computing the cosine similarity between two vectors returns how similar these vectors are. A cosinesimilarity of 1 means that the angle between the two vectors is 0, and thus both vectors have thesame direction.Seneca’s Moral letters to Lucilius deal mostly with philosophical topics, as Seneca was, among many otherthings, a philosopher of the stoic school. The stoic school of philosophy is quiteinteresting, but it has been unfortunately misunderstood, especially in modern times. There is now a renewed interest forthis school, see Modern Stoicism.

The first step is to scrape the letters. The code below scrapes the letters, and saves them into a list.I first start by writing a function that gets the raw text. Note the `xpath` argument of the `html_nodes()`function. I obtained this complex expression by using the SelectorGadgetextension for Google Chrome, and then selecting the right element of the web page.See this screenshot if my description was not very clear.

Then, the `extract_text()` function extracts the text from the letter. The only line that might bea bit complex is `discard(~`==`(., ""))` which removes every empty line.

Finally, there’s the `get_letter()` function that actually gets the letter by calling the first twofunctions. In the last line, I get all the letters into a list by mapping the list of urls to the`get_letter()` function.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

base_url <- "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_"

letter_numbers <- seq(1, 124)

letter_urls <- paste0(base_url, letter_numbers)

get_raw_text <- function(base_url, letter_number){
 paste0(base_url, letter_number) %>%
 read_html() %>%
 html_nodes(xpath ='//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "mw-parser-output", " " ))]') %>% 
 html_text()
}


extract_text <- function(raw_text, letter_number){
 raw_text <- raw_text %>%
 str_split("\n") %>% 
 flatten_chr() %>% 
 discard(~`==`(., ""))

 start <- 5

 end <- str_which(raw_text, "Footnotes*")

 raw_text[start:(end-1)] %>%
 str_remove_all("\\[\\d{1,}\\]") %>%
 str_remove_all("\\[edit\\]")
}

get_letter <- function(base_url, letter_number){

 raw_text <- get_raw_text(base_url, letter_number)

 extract_text(raw_text, letter_number)
}

letters_to_lucilius <- map2(base_url, letter_numbers, get_letter)
```

Now that we have the letters saved in a list, we need to process the text a little bit. In orderto compute the cosine similarity between the letters, I need to somehow represent them as vectors.There are several ways of doing this, and I am going to compute the tf-idf of each letter. The tf-idfwill give me a vector for each letter, with zero and non-zero values. Zero values represent wordsthat are common to all letters, and thus do not have any *predictive power*. Non-zero values arewords that are not present in all letters, but maybe only a few. I expect that letters thatdiscuss death for example, will have the word death in them, and letters that do not discuss deathwill not have this word. The word death thus has what I call *predictive power*, in that it helpsus distinguish the letters discussing death from the other letters that do not discuss it. The samereasoning can be applied for any topic.

So, to get the tf-idf of each letter, I first need to put them in a tidy dataset. I will use the`{tidytext}` package for this. First, I load the required packages, convert each letter to adataframe of one column that contains the text, and save the letter’s titles into another list:

```
library(tidytext)
library(SnowballC)
library(stopwords)
library(text2vec)

letters_to_lucilius_df <- map(letters_to_lucilius, ~tibble("text" = .))

letter_titles <- letters_to_lucilius_df %>%
 map(~slice(., 1)) %>%
 map(pull)
```

Now, I add this title to each dataframe as a new column, called title:

```
letters_to_lucilius_df <- map2(.x = letters_to_lucilius_df, .y = letter_titles,
 ~mutate(.x, title = .y)) %>%
 map(~slice(., -1))
```

I can now use `unnest_tokens()` to transform the datasets. Before, I had the whole text of the letterin one column. After using `unnest_tokens()` I now have a dataset with one row per word. This willmake it easy to compute frequencies by letters, or what I am interested in, the tf-idf of each letter:

```
tokenized_letters <- letters_to_lucilius_df %>%
 bind_rows() %>%
 group_by(title) %>%
 unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

I can now remove stopwords, using the data containing in the `{stopwords}` package:

```
stopwords_en <- tibble("word" = stopwords("en", source = "smart"))

tokenized_letters <- tokenized_letters %>%
 anti_join(stopwords_en) %>%
 filter(!str_detect(word, "\\d{1,}"))
```

```
## Joining, by = "word"
```

Next step, wordstemming, meaning, going from “dogs” to “dog”, or from “was” to “be”. If you do notdo wordstemming, “dogs” and “dog” will be considered different words, even though they are not.`wordStem()` is a function from `{SnowballC}`.

```
tokenized_letters <- tokenized_letters %>%
 mutate(word = wordStem(word, language = "en"))
```

Finally, I can compute the tf-idf of each letter and cast the data as a sparse matrix:

```
tfidf_letters <- tokenized_letters %>%
 count(title, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
 bind_tf_idf(word, title, n)

sparse_matrix <- tfidf_letters %>%
 cast_sparse(title, word, tf)
```

Let’s take a look at the sparse matrix:

```
sparse_matrix[1:10, 1:4]
```

We can consider each row of this matrix as the vector representing a letter, and thus compute thecosine similarity between letters. For this, I am using the `sim2()` function from the `{text2vec}`package. I then create the `get_similar_letters()` function that returns similar letters for agiven reference letter:

```
similarities <- sim2(sparse_matrix, method = "cosine", norm = "l2") 

get_similar_letters <- function(similarities, reference_letter, n_recommendations = 3){
 sort(similarities[reference_letter, ], decreasing = TRUE)[1:(2 + n_recommendations)]
}
```

```
get_similar_letters(similarities, 19)
```

```

As we can see from these examples, this seems to be working quite well: the first title is thetitle of the reference letter, will the next 3 are the suggested letters. The problem is that mymatrix is not in the right order, and thus reference letter 19 does not correspond to letter 19of Seneca… I have to correct that, but not today.
