**HGC: Hierarchical Group Convolution for Highly Efficient Neural Network**

Group convolution works well with many deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can effectively compress the model by reducing the number of parameters and computational cost. Using this operation, feature maps of different group cannot communicate, which restricts their representation capability. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel operation named Hierarchical Group Convolution (HGC) for creating computationally efficient neural networks. Different from standard group convolution which blocks the inter-group information exchange and induces the severe performance degradation, HGC can hierarchically fuse the feature maps from each group and leverage the inter-group information effectively. Taking advantage of the proposed method, we introduce a family of compact networks called HGCNets. Compared to networks using standard group convolution, HGCNets have a huge improvement in accuracy at the same model size and complexity level. Extensive experimental results on the CIFAR dataset demonstrate that HGCNets obtain significant reduction of parameters and computational cost to achieve comparable performance over the prior CNN architectures designed for mobile devices such as MobileNet and ShuffleNet.

**Attention-based Conditioning Methods for External Knowledge Integration**

In this paper, we present a novel approach for incorporating external knowledge in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We propose the integration of lexicon features into the self-attention mechanism of RNN-based architectures. This form of conditioning on the attention distribution, enforces the contribution of the most salient words for the task at hand. We introduce three methods, namely attentional concatenation, feature-based gating and affine transformation. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our methods. Attentional feature-based gating yields consistent performance improvement across tasks. Our approach is implemented as a simple add-on module for RNN-based models with minimal computational overhead and can be adapted to any deep neural architecture.

**Redundancy-Free Computation Graphs for Graph Neural Networks**

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are based on repeated aggregations of information across nodes’ neighbors in a graph. However, because common neighbors are shared between different nodes, this leads to repeated and inefficient computations. We propose Hierarchically Aggregated computation Graphs (HAGs), a new GNN graph representation that explicitly avoids redundancy by managing intermediate aggregation results hierarchically, eliminating repeated computations and unnecessary data transfers in GNN training and inference. We introduce an accurate cost function to quantitatively evaluate the runtime performance of different HAGs and use a novel HAG search algorithm to find optimized HAGs. Experiments show that the HAG representation significantly outperforms the standard GNN graph representation by increasing the end-to-end training throughput by up to 2.8x and reducing the aggregations and data transfers in GNN training by up to 6.3x and 5.6x, while maintaining the original model accuracy.

**Degrees of Freedom Analysis of Unrolled Neural Networks**

Unrolled neural networks emerged recently as an effective model for learning inverse maps appearing in image restoration tasks. However, their generalization risk (i.e., test mean-squared-error) and its link to network design and train sample size remains mysterious. Leveraging the Stein’s Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), this paper analyzes the generalization risk with its bias and variance components for recurrent unrolled networks. We particularly investigate the degrees-of-freedom (DOF) component of SURE, trace of the end-to-end network Jacobian, to quantify the prediction variance. We prove that DOF is well-approximated by the weighted \textit{path sparsity} of the network under incoherence conditions on the trained weights. Empirically, we examine the SURE components as a function of train sample size for both recurrent and non-recurrent (with many more parameters) unrolled networks. Our key observations indicate that: 1) DOF increases with train sample size and converges to the generalization risk for both recurrent and non-recurrent schemes; 2) recurrent network converges significantly faster (with less train samples) compared with non-recurrent scheme, hence recurrence serves as a regularization for low sample size regimes.

**Generative Continual Concept Learning**

After learning a concept, humans are also able to continually generalize their learned concepts to new domains by observing only a few labeled instances without any interference with the past learned knowledge. In contrast, learning concepts efficiently in a continual learning setting remains an open challenge for current Artificial Intelligence algorithms as persistent model retraining is necessary. Inspired by the Parallel Distributed Processing learning and the Complementary Learning Systems theories, we develop a computational model that is able to expand its previously learned concepts efficiently to new domains using a few labeled samples. We couple the new form of a concept to its past learned forms in an embedding space for effective continual learning. Doing so, a generative distribution is learned such that it is shared across the tasks in the embedding space and models the abstract concepts. This procedure enables the model to generate pseudo-data points to replay the past experience to tackle catastrophic forgetting.

**Attacking Graph Convolutional Networks via Rewiring**

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and graph classification. Recent researches show that graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which deliberately add carefully created unnoticeable perturbation to the graph structure. The perturbation is usually created by adding/deleting a few edges, which might be noticeable even when the number of edges modified is small. In this paper, we propose a graph rewiring operation which affects the graph in a less noticeable way compared to adding/deleting edges. We then use reinforcement learning to learn the attack strategy based on the proposed rewiring operation. Experiments on real world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To understand the proposed framework, we further analyze how its generated perturbation to the graph structure affects the output of the target model.

**Identifying Data And Information Streams In Cyberspace: A Multi-Dimensional Perspective**

Cyberspace has gradually replaced the physical reality, its role evolving from a simple enabler of daily live processes to a necessity for modern existence. As a result of this convergence of physical and virtual realities, for all processes being critically dependent on networked communications, information representative of our physical, logical and social thoughts is constantly being generated in cyberspace. The interconnection and integration of links between our physical and virtual realities creates a new hyperspace as a source of data and information. Additionally, significant studies in cyber analysis have predominantly revolved around a single linear analysis of information from a single source of evidence (The Network). These studies are limited in their ability to understand the dynamics of relationships across the multiple dimensions of cyberspace. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional perspective for data identification in cyberspace. It provides critical discussions for identifying entangled relationships amongst entities across cyberspace.

**Incorporating Open Data into Introductory Courses in Statistics**

The 2016 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report emphasized six recommendations to teach introductory courses in statistics. Among them: use of real data with context and purpose. Many educators have created databases consisting of multiple data sets for use in class; sometimes making hundreds of data sets available. Yet `the context and purpose’ component of the data may remain elusive if just a generic database is made available. We describe the use of open data in introductory courses. Countries and cities continue to share data through open data portals. Hence, educators can find regional data that engages their students more effectively. We present excerpts from case studies that show the application of statistical methods to data on: crime, housing, rainfall, tourist travel, and others. Data wrangling and discussion of results are recognized as important case study components. Thus the open data based case studies attend most GAISE College Report recommendations. Reproducible \textsf{R} code is made available for each case study. Example uses of open data in more advanced courses in statistics are also described.

**DataLearner: A Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Tool for Android Smartphones and Tablets**

Smartphones have become the ultimate ‘personal’ computer, yet despite this, general-purpose data-mining and knowledge discovery tools for mobile devices are surprisingly rare. DataLearner is a new data-mining application designed specifically for Android devices that imports the Weka data-mining engine and augments it with algorithms developed by Charles Sturt University. Moreover, DataLearner can be expanded with additional algorithms. Combined, DataLearner delivers 40 classification, clustering and association rule mining algorithms for model training and evaluation without need for cloud computing resources or network connectivity. It provides the same classification accuracy as PCs and laptops, while doing so with acceptable processing speed and consuming negligible battery life. With its ability to provide easy-to-use data-mining on a phone-size screen, DataLearner is a new portable, self-contained data-mining tool for remote, personalised and learning applications alike. DataLearner features four elements – this paper, the app available on Google Play, the GPL3-licensed source code on GitHub and a short video on YouTube.

**FairLedger: A Fair Blockchain Protocol for Financial Institutions**

Financial institutions are currently looking into technologies for permissioned blockchains. A major effort in this direction is Hyperledger, an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation and backed by a consortium of over a hundred companies. A key component in permissioned blockchain protocols is a byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus engine that orders transactions. However, currently available BFT solutions in Hyperledger (as well as in the literature at large) are inadequate for financial settings; they are not designed to ensure fairness or to tolerate selfish behavior that arises when financial institutions strive to maximize their own profit. We present FairLedger, a permissioned blockchain BFT protocol, which is fair, designed to deal with rational behavior, and, no less important, easy to understand and implement. The secret sauce of our protocol is a new communication abstraction, called detectable all-to-all (DA2A), which allows us to detect participants (byzantine or rational) that deviate from the protocol, and punish them. We implement FairLedger in the Hyperledger open source project, using Iroha framework, one of the biggest projects therein. To evaluate FairLegder’s performance, we also implement it in the PBFT framework and compare the two protocols. Our results show that in failure-free scenarios FairLedger achieves better throughput than both Iroha’s implementation and PBFT in wide-area settings.

**Open-Domain Targeted Sentiment Analysis via Span-Based Extraction and Classification**

Open-domain targeted sentiment analysis aims to detect opinion targets along with their sentiment polarities from a sentence. Prior work typically formulates this task as a sequence tagging problem. However, such formulation suffers from problems such as huge search space and sentiment inconsistency. To address these problems, we propose a span-based extract-then-classify framework, where multiple opinion targets are directly extracted from the sentence under the supervision of target span boundaries, and corresponding polarities are then classified using their span representations. We further investigate three approaches under this framework, namely the pipeline, joint, and collapsed models. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the sequence tagging baseline. Moreover, we find that the pipeline model achieves the best performance compared with the other two models.

**Time-Series Anomaly Detection Service at Microsoft**

Large companies need to monitor various metrics (for example, Page Views and Revenue) of their applications and services in real time. At Microsoft, we develop a time-series anomaly detection service which helps customers to monitor the time-series continuously and alert for potential incidents on time. In this paper, we introduce the pipeline and algorithm of our anomaly detection service, which is designed to be accurate, efficient and general. The pipeline consists of three major modules, including data ingestion, experimentation platform and online compute. To tackle the problem of time-series anomaly detection, we propose a novel algorithm based on Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our work is the first attempt to borrow the SR model from visual saliency detection domain to time-series anomaly detection. Moreover, we innovatively combine SR and CNN together to improve the performance of SR model. Our approach achieves superior experimental results compared with state-of-the-art baselines on both public datasets and Microsoft production data.

**Making Classical Machine Learning Pipelines Differentiable: A Neural Translation Approach**

Classical Machine Learning (ML) pipelines often comprise of multiple ML models where models, within a pipeline, are trained in isolation. Conversely, when training neural network models, layers composing the neural models are simultaneously trained using backpropagation. We argue that the isolated training scheme of ML pipelines is sub-optimal, since it cannot jointly optimize multiple components. To this end, we propose a framework that translates a pre-trained ML pipeline into a neural network and fine-tunes the ML models within the pipeline jointly using backpropagation. Our experiments show that fine-tuning of the translated pipelines is a promising technique able to increase the final accuracy.

**A Survey on Neural Machine Reading Comprehension**

Enabling a machine to read and comprehend the natural language documents so that it can answer some questions remains an elusive challenge. In recent years, the popularity of deep learning and the establishment of large-scale datasets have both promoted the prosperity of Machine Reading Comprehension. This paper aims to present how to utilize the Neural Network to build a Reader and introduce some classic models, analyze what improvements they make. Further, we also point out the defects of existing models and future research directions

**Network Implosion: Effective Model Compression for ResNets via Static Layer Pruning and Retraining**

Residual Networks with convolutional layers are widely used in the field of machine learning. Since they effectively extract features from input data by stacking multiple layers, they can achieve high accuracy in many applications. However, the stacking of many layers raises their computation costs. To address this problem, we propose Network Implosion, it erases multiple layers from Residual Networks without degrading accuracy. Our key idea is to introduce a priority term that identifies the importance of a layer; we can select unimportant layers according to the priority and erase them after the training. In addition, we retrain the networks to avoid critical drops in accuracy after layer erasure. A theoretical assessment reveals that our erasure and retraining scheme can erase layers without accuracy drop, and achieve higher accuracy than is possible with training from scratch. Our experiments show that Network Implosion can, for classification on Cifar-10/100 and ImageNet, reduce the number of layers by 24.00 to 42.86 percent without any drop in accuracy.

**Learning Fair Naive Bayes Classifiers by Discovering and Eliminating Discrimination Patterns**

As machine learning is increasingly used to make real-world decisions, recent research efforts aim to define and ensure fairness in algorithmic decision making. Existing methods often assume a fixed set of observable features to define individuals, but lack a discussion of certain features not being observed at test time. In this paper, we study fairness of naive Bayes classifiers, which allow partial observations. In particular, we introduce the notion of a discrimination pattern, which refers to an individual receiving different classifications depending on whether some sensitive attributes were observed. Then a model is considered fair if it has no such pattern. We propose an algorithm to discover and mine for discrimination patterns in a naive Bayes classifier, and show how to learn maximum-likelihood parameters subject to these fairness constraints. Our approach iteratively discovers and eliminates discrimination patterns until a fair model is learned. An empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that we can remove exponentially many discrimination patterns by only adding a small fraction of them as constraints.

**Topic-Aware Neural Keyphrase Generation for Social Media Language**

A huge volume of user-generated content is daily produced on social media. To facilitate automatic language understanding, we study keyphrase prediction, distilling salient information from massive posts. While most existing methods extract words from source posts to form keyphrases, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) based neural keyphrase generation framework, enabling absent keyphrases to be created. Moreover, our model, being topic-aware, allows joint modeling of corpus-level latent topic representations, which helps alleviate the data sparsity that widely exhibited in social media language. Experiments on three datasets collected from English and Chinese social media platforms show that our model significantly outperforms both extraction and generation models that do not exploit latent topics. Further discussions show that our model learns meaningful topics, which interprets its superiority in social media keyphrase generation.

**A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Informed by Natural Language**

To be successful in real-world tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) needs to exploit the compositional, relational, and hierarchical structure of the world, and learn to transfer it to the task at hand. Recent advances in representation learning for language make it possible to build models that acquire world knowledge from text corpora and integrate this knowledge into downstream decision making problems. We thus argue that the time is right to investigate a tight integration of natural language understanding into RL in particular. We survey the state of the field, including work on instruction following, text games, and learning from textual domain knowledge. Finally, we call for the development of new environments as well as further investigation into the potential uses of recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for such tasks.
