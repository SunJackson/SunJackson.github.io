New product releases are exciting, but can also come with some amount of confusion; how will the tool you know and love change? Will your workflow need tweaking? And most importantly, how will you learn to use new features fluently? We looked at the four best ways to focus your exploration and take advantage of new feature releases.

## 4. Video Tutorials

When you want a quick, visual explanation of a new feature or topic, video tutorials are your best bet. Usually clocking in at a minute long, the videos provide a great overview of what to expect from a new feature and what navigation looks like. While you won't become an expert in a minute, these tutorials can help focus your learning to the features that will matter most to you.

## 1. Documentation

The docs get into the weeds of the product, all the way down to the implementation level. Once you've got the big picture from videos and demos, this is the most comprehensive and technical way to learn about new releases, and a great way to level-up your understanding.
