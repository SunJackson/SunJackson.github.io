[Cloudera University](http://university.cloudera.com/.) is the world leader in Apache Hadoop [training](http://university.cloudera.com/training/courses.html) and [certification](http://university.cloudera.com/certification.html). Our full suite of live courses and [online materials](http://university.cloudera.com/onlineresources.html) is the best resource to get started with your Hadoop cluster in development or advance it towards production.  We offer deep industry insight into the skills and expertise required to establish yourself as a leading [Developer](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/developer.html) or [Administrator](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/administrator.html) managing and processing Big Data in this fast-growing field.

But did you know Cloudera training can also help you plan for the advanced stages and progress of your Hadoop cluster? In addition to core training for [Developers](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/developer.html) and [Administrators](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/administrator.html), we also offer the best (and, in some cases, only) opportunity to get up to speed on lifecycle projects within the Hadoop ecosystem in a classroom setting. [Cloudera University’s](http://university.cloudera.com/.) course offerings go beyond the basics to include [Training for Apache HBase](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hbase/hbase.html), [Training for Apache Hive and Pig](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hive_and_pig/hive_and_pig.html), and [Introduction to Data Science: Building Recommender Systems](http://university.cloudera.com/training/data_science/introduction_to_data_science_-_building_recommender_systems.html). Depending on your Big Data agenda, Cloudera training can help you increase the accessibility and queryability of your data, push your data performance towards real-time, conduct business-critical analyses using familiar scripting languages, build new applications and customer-facing products, and conduct data experiments to improve your overall productivity and profitability.

For a limited time, [Cloudera University](http://university.cloudera.com/.) is offering a 15% discount when you register for two or more Hadoop training courses to help you build out and realize your Big Data plan. Cover the basics with [Developer](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/developer.html) or [Administrator](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/administrator.html) training, move beyond the HDFS and MapReduce core by pairing [Developer](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hadoop/developer.html) and [HBase](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hbase/hbase.html) training, work towards machine learning with [Hive and Pig](http://university.cloudera.com/training/apache_hive_and_pig/hive_and_pig.html) training and [Introduction to Data Science](http://university.cloudera.com/training/data_science/introduction_to_data_science_-_building_recommender_systems.html), or customize your own learning path.  Just use discount code 15off2 when you register for multiple public training classes from Cloudera University. This offer is only available for new enrollments and is only valid for classes delivered by Cloudera and scheduled to begin before March 1, 2013.
