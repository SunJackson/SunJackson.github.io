Besides performing a line-by-line analysis of memory consumption,
[`memory_profiler`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler)
exposes some functions that allow to retrieve the memory consumption
of a function in real-time, allowing e.g. to visualize the memory
consumption of a given function over time.

The function to be used is `memory_usage`. The first argument
specifies what code is to be monitored. This can represent either an
external process or a Python function. In the case of an external
process the first argument is an integer representing its process
identifier (PID). In the case of a Python function, we need pass the
function and its arguments to memory_usage. We do this by passing the
tuple `(f, args, kw)` that specifies the function, its position
arguments as a tuple and its keyword arguments as a dictionary,
respectively. This will be then executed by `memory_usage` as
`f(*args, **kw)`.

Let's see this with an example. Take as function NumPy's
[pseudo-inverse function](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.pinv.html). Thus
`f = numpy.linalg.pinv` and `f` takes one positional argument (the
matrix to be inverted) so `args = (a,)` where `a` is the matrix to be
inverted. Note that args must be a tuple consisting of the different
arguments, thus the parenthesis around `a`. The third item is a
dictionary `kw` specifying the keyword arguments. Here kw is optional
and is omitted.

This has given me a list specifying at different time intervals (t0,
t0 + .01, t0 + .02, ...) at which the measurements where taken. Now I can
use that to for example plot the memory consumption as a function of
time:

This will give the memory usage of a single function across time, which 
might be interesting for example to detect temporaries that would be
created during the execution. 

Another use case for `memory_usage` would be to see how memory behaves
as input data gets bigger. In this case we are interested in memory as
a function of the input data. One obvious way we can do this is by
calling the same function each time with a different input and take as
memory consumption the maximum consumption over time. This way we will
have a memory usage for each input.

It is now possible to plot these results as a function of the
dimensions.
