Recently, I wrote an article about fat-finger typos. These are mistakes in which, when aiming for a certain letter, you miss and hit one of the neighboring keys. If the resulting mistake is also a legitimately spelled word, the mistake is called an atomic typo. Because the offending word is correctly spelled, these errors are not picked up by standard spell-checking software. My original article talked about words created by hitting keys next to the desired one can be found [here](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november42012/index.html).
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january32013/f.png)|In this article, I'm going to describe a different class of atomic typos. These are errors caused by the switching of two adjacent letters. For instance instead of typing NUCLEAR, if you mistakenly switched the first two letters you'd end up with the very different word UNCLEAR.Just like the previous class of errors, these miss-types are not detected with regular spell check.|

Just like the previous class of errors, these miss-types are not detected with regular spell check.

In this article, I've created a list of all the legitimate atomic typos that can be found be switching just one set of adjacent letters. Obviously, there are some trivial examples; any word that contains two (or more) of the same letter in a row can make an atomic typo that ends up being exactly the same word! If you made a typing error and switched the two middle letters of the word FOOD by mistake, you end up with the same word. I'm going to discount these words.
