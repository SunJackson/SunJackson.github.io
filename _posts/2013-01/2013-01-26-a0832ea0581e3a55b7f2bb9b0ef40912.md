### 
Universal Turing Machine in C#





Here is a complete Universal Turing Machine I wrote in C#. The state table computes general relativity, based on my "theory of everything" down in another blog post. Each bit on the tape represents a photon and each full cycle represents a frame of reference.

I've excluded some code from my implementation so that it is easier to read, specifically if you run this, make sure you change the stopping criteria or run it in a console application in debug mode with a break point.

This is easily ported to JavaScript, so look forward to a jQuery plugin soon.

A paper where Turing first proposed the idea of computable numbers:******
