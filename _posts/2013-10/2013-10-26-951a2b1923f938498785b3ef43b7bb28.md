### Joining[¶](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/working-with-pandas-dataframes#Joining)

Throughout an analysis, we'll often need to merge/join datasets as data is typically stored in a [relational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) manner.

Our MovieLens data is a good example of this - a rating requires both a user and a movie, and the datasets are linked together by a key - in this case, the user_id and movie_id. It's possible for a user to be associated with zero or many ratings and movies. Likewise, a movie can be rated zero or many times, by a number of different users.

Like SQL's JOIN clause, `pandas.merge` allows two DataFrames to be joined on one or more keys. The function provides a series of parameters `(on, left_on, right_on, left_index, right_index)` allowing you to specify the columns or indexes on which to join.

By default, `pandas.merge` operates as an *inner join*, which can be changed using the `how` parameter.

From the function's docstring:

> how : {'left', 'right', 'outer', 'inner'}, default 'inner'

left: use only keys from left frame (SQL: left outer join)

right: use only keys from right frame (SQL: right outer join)

outer: use union of keys from both frames (SQL: full outer join)

inner: use intersection of keys from both frames (SQL: inner join)




Below are some examples of what each look like.
