*UPDATE: If you're interested in learning pandas from a SQL perspective and would prefer to watch a video, you can find video of my 2014 PyData NYC talk [here](http://reda.io/sql2pandas).*

*This is part three of a three part introduction to [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/.), a Python library for data analysis. The tutorial is primarily geared towards SQL users, but is useful for anyone wanting to get started with the library.*

*Part 1: [Intro to pandas data structures](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures)*

*Part 2: [Working with DataFrames](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/working-with-pandas-dataframes)*

*Part 3: [Using pandas with the MovieLens dataset](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/using-pandas-on-the-movielens-dataset)*

In [61]:

```
SELECT title, count(1)
FROM lens
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 25;


```

Alternatively, pandas has a nifty `value_counts` method - yes, this is simpler - the goal above was to show a basic `groupby` example.

In [64]:

```
SELECT title, COUNT(1) size, AVG(rating) mean
FROM lens
GROUP BY title
HAVING COUNT(1) >= 100
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 15;
```




**Limiting our population going forward**

Going forward, let's only look at the 50 most rated movies. Let's make a Series of movies that meet this threshold so we can use it for filtering later.

In [68]:

```
CREATE TABLE most_50 AS (
 SELECT movie_id, COUNT(1)
 FROM lens
 GROUP BY movie_id
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
 LIMIT 50
);


```

This table would then allow us to use EXISTS, IN, or JOIN whenever we wanted to filter our results. Here's an example using EXISTS:

```
SELECT *
FROM lens
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM most_50 WHERE lens.movie_id = most_50.movie_id);
```




**Which movies are most controversial amongst different ages?**




Let's look at how these movies are viewed across different age groups. First, let's look at how age is distributed amongst our users.

In [69]:

```
pandas.cut allows you to bin numeric data. In the above lines, we first created labels to name our bins, then split our users into eight bins of ten years (0-9, 10-19, 20-29, etc.). Our use of `right=False` told the function that we wanted the bins to be *exclusive* of the max age in the bin (e.g. a 30 year old user gets the 30s label).
Now we can now compare ratings across age groups.





In [71]:


lens.groupby('age_group').agg({'rating': [np.size, np.mean]})







Out[71]:





|
|rating



|
|size
|mean



|age_group
|
|





|0-9
|43
|3.767442



|10-19
|8181

|3.467333

|3.635800



|60-69
|2623
|3.648875



|70-79
|197
|3.649746















Young users seem a bit more critical than other age groups. Let's look at how the 50 most rated movies are viewed across each age group. We can use the `most_50` Series we created earlier for filtering.





In [72]:


lens.set_index('movie_id', inplace=True)







In [73]:


by_age = lens.loc[most_50.index].groupby(['title', 'age_group'])
by_age.rating.mean().head(15)







Out[73]:

title age_group
Air Force One (1997) 10-19 3.647059
 20-29 3.666667
 30-39 3.570000
 40-49 3.555556
 50-59 3.750000
 60-69 3.666667
 70-79 3.666667
Alien (1979) 10-19 4.111111
 20-29 4.026087
 30-39 4.103448
 40-49 3.833333
 50-59 4.272727
 60-69 3.500000
 70-79 4.000000
Aliens (1986) 10-19 4.050000
Name: rating, dtype: float64










Notice that both the title and age group are indexes here, with the average rating value being a Series. This is going to produce a really long list of values.
Wouldn't it be nice to see the data as a table? Each title as a row, each age group as a column, and the average rating in each cell.
Behold! The magic of `unstack`!

by_age.rating.mean().unstack(1).fillna(0)[10:20]

`unstack`, well, unstacks the specified level of a [MultiIndex](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex) (by default, `groupby` turns the grouped field into an index - since we grouped by two fields, it became a MultiIndex). We unstacked the second index (remember that Python uses 0-based indexes), and then filled in NULL values with 0.
If we would have used:
by_age.rating.mean().unstack(0).fillna(0)

We would have had our age groups as rows and movie titles as columns.








**Which movies do men and women most disagree on?**
EDIT: *I realized after writing this question that Wes McKinney basically went through the exact same question in his book. It's a good, yet simple example of pivot_table, so I'm going to leave it here. Seriously though, [go buy the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449319793/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449319793&linkCode=as2&tag=gjreda-20&linkId=MCGW4C4NOBRVV5OC).*
Think about how you'd have to do this in SQL for a second. You'd have to use a combination of IF/CASE statements with aggregate functions in order to pivot your dataset. Your query would look something like this:
SELECT title, AVG(IF(sex = 'F', rating, NULL)), AVG(IF(sex = 'M', rating, NULL))
FROM lens
GROUP BY title;


```

Imagine how annoying it'd be if you had to do this on more than two columns.

DataFrame's have a *pivot_table* method that makes these kinds of operations much easier (and less verbose).

Of course men like Terminator more than women. Independence Day though? Really?




**Closing**

This is the point where I finally wrap this tutorial up. Hopefully I've covered the basics well enough to pique your interest and help you get started with the library. If I've missed something critical, feel free to [let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gjreda) or in the comments - I'd love constructive feedback.
