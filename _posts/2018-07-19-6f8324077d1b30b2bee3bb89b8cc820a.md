Remember when everyone had a really ugly blog with a *blogroll*? Anyway, just think the word is funny.

I follow a few hundred blogs using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/.) and [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) and have been reading a few hundred thousand blog posts over the last 10 years. Here’s some stuff I think everyone should follow. Not going to share a million blogs, just a few top ones. That way you don’t have to think about it, just subscribe to all of it:

## Software engineering

Lots of company blogs are good:

Some personal blogs worth mentioning:

## Math

## Startups / business

## Economics / politics

## Other stuff

## That’s it!

I probably forgot a ton of *fantastic* blogs here!

And remember – *on the internet, no one knows you’re a dog*
