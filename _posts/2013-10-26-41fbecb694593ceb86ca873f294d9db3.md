[A while back I claimed](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/01/23/translating-sql-to-pandas-part1) I was going to write a couple of posts on translating [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/.) to SQL. I never followed up. However, the other week a couple of coworkers expressed their interest in learning a bit more about it - this seemed like a good reason to revisit the topic.

What follows is a fairly thorough introduction to the library. I chose to break it into three parts as I felt it was too long and daunting as one.

If you'd like to follow along, you can find the necessary CSV files [here](https://github.com/gjreda/gregreda.com/tree/master/content/notebooks/data) and the MovieLens dataset [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip).

My goal for this tutorial is to teach the basics of pandas by comparing and contrasting its syntax with SQL. Since all of my coworkers are familiar with SQL, I feel this is the best way to provide a context that can be easily understood by the intended audience.

If you're interested in learning more about the library, pandas author [Wes McKinney](https://twitter.com/wesmckinn) has written [Python for Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449319793/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449319793&linkCode=as2&tag=gjreda-20&linkId=MCGW4C4NOBRVV5OC), which covers it in much greater detail.
