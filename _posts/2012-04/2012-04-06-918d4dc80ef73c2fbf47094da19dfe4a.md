I've always assumed there was some sort of tax benefit to filing
U.S. federal taxes jointly with a partner. Now that I'm filing taxes
for the first time after getting married, however, I see that it's
not so simple. There is a tax *benefit* if two partners have
disparate individual incomes, but there is a *penalty* if both
partners have roughly equal incomes. The following graphic shows the
difference in the taxes between filing jointly and separately as
percentage of joint income:

The values represented in the diagram are the difference between the
total amount of taxes that a couple would owe (with
the 2011
federal U.S. tax schedule) if they were to file jointly or file
separately, given as a percentage of the couple's total income. For
example, if the lower-earning partner earns $25,000 and the
higher-earning partner earns $75,000 they owe $18,200 if filing
separately and $17,250 if filing jointly, resulting in a marriage
benefit of $950, or about 1% of their total income.



A little googling revealed that the
whole “marriage
penalty, marriage benefit”
story isn't
quite so simple; for example, married couples filing jointly can
enjoy preferential estate-tax treatment. However, if the benefits of
filing jointly are not relevant, many married couples may pay less
tax by filing separately.
