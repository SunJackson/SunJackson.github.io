Like other first-time parents entering week 40, I am getting
increasingly anxious to meet my little man. Our son is "due" on
April 25 — one week from today — but the reality is that
his birth is not something for which you can plan. As convenient as
it would be, I won't receive a calendar invite from the womb (with
a 0-minute reminder, of course) with detailed instructions on how to
get to the hospital sans police. The fact of the matter is, we just
aren't that great at predicting birth days yet (every birthday
celebration after that is pretty straightforward).



Despite the difficulty in making precise predictions, my wife and I
are really interested in knowing when our baby will be born. Will it
be tomorrow? What about the day after that? Fortunately, there
is some
data out there that can shed some light on these questions.



Considering that there
are significant physiological
differences between first-time and repeat mothers, I restricted
my analysis to only those mothers that had zero previous births. To
properly account for the fact that we also know that our baby has
not been born yet, I further restricted my analysis to all births
that happen beyond the start of week 40. I then calculated the
probability that our baby will be born on any particular day:

Although this doesn't tell us the precise date during which our baby
will be born, it definitely gives us more information about when we
can expect to be parents. For the next few days, for instance, we're
flipping a
weighted coin with a 4% chance of landing heads (baby born) and
a 96% chance of landing tails. Eventually, given enough chances, we
are bound to see a head (pun intended).



For those that find this interesting and/or useful, I've been
toying around with creating an interactive version of this for
others to use — perhaps as a paternity leave project?
