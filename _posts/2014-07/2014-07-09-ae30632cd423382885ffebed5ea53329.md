What is the largest cylinder that is possible to fit inside a sphere? Let me make that a little clearer. Out of all the cylinders that it is possible to carve out of a solid sphere, which one has the highest *volume*? Or, as an even better definition: What is the highest achievable ratio of the volume of the cylinder to the volume of the donor sphere?

Obviously, if it’s going to be the highest, it’s going to have to touch the edge of the sphere, and from symmetry you can appreciate that it will take the form above (where the entire circular edge of each cylinder end-cap touches the sphere), but is the optimal solution a fat squat disk? Is it tall thin cylinder? Or is it somewhere in-between?

### Geometry Time

Let's start with a few definitions:
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/one.png)|*R*  The radius of the sphere*h*  The height of the cylinder*r*  The radius of the cylinder *Vc*  The volume cylinder*Vs*  The volume sphere|

*h*  The height of the cylinder

 

*Vs*  The volume sphere
|Imagining a cross-section through the center of the cylinder we can see the following geometry.The radius of the sphere defines the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle, and using simple Pythagoras we can define the relationship between our variables:![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/eq0.png)|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/cross.png)|

The radius of the sphere defines the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle, and using simple Pythagoras we can define the relationship between our variables:

### Calculus

It's time to wake up *Newton* and *Leibniz*. We're going to break out some high school calculus to solve this problem. Here is the equation for the volume of the cylinder, and into it I've substituted the cylinder radius with that derived from the Pythagorean geometry.

We have our equation for the volume of the cylinder, now we'll take the first differential with respect to height:

If we set the first differential to zero, we can find the turning points in the function.

|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/eq5.png)|A quick confirmation confirms that the second differential is negative (meaning that the turning point is a *maximum* value). This gives us our first first result: the value for the height of the cylinder when the it has maximum volume.|

### Substituting back in

Now that we have the value of *h* for maximum volume, we can substitute this back into the equation for the volume of the cyliner *Vc*

Result! We have the formula for the volume of the maximum cylinder that can be carved out of a sphere.

All that is left to do is normalize this by dividing it the volume of the sphere. The final result is the ration of the volume of the cylinder to the volume of the sphere. This is a very pleasing result.

### Graph

We'll pause here for a second to plot a graph. It's interesting to look at how the volume of the largest possible cylinder changes with respect to the height of the cylinder.

On the *x-axis*, I've plotted height *h* ranging from zero on the left (an infinitesimally thin disk with the same radius as the sphere), to *2R* on the right (a stick from pole-pole with no cross-sectional area).

On the *y-axis* I've plotted the ratio of the volume of the cylinder to to the volume of the sphere.

The curve clearly shows the maximum point at the calculated value, and falling off to zero at the two extremes.

### Further down the rabbit hole …
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/dome.png)|At either end of the cylindrical plug are two *spherical caps*.These are *not* hemispheres (unless the special case where cylinder is infinitely thin and so the plane cuts right through the center of the sphere).What is the volume of one of these caps?Rather than derive it here, I'll look it up on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cap)![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/eq9.png)With some algebra this can be rearranged to give an equation without the smaller radius.![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22014/eq10.png)|

This segues perfectly into a Puzzle that is, arguable, one the [Martin Gardner's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner) most famous puzzles:
