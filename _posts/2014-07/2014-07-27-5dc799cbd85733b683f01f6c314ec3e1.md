Ever wondered where people often go when they get on those Divvy bikes? A Chicago data scientist did. So, using data from when Divvy bikeshare users check out and return their bikes to their docks, Gabriel Gaster [created a map](http://divvy.datasco.pe/) of all 750,000 [ Divvy trips](http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/July-2014/What-Does-Bike-Share-Data-Tell-Us-About-Chicago) taken in 2013. More precisely, the map's website characterizes the data as a "heatmap of aggregate bike trips throughout the city from a selected station...". Each region highlighted by the map represents an area approximately half a mile away from the mapped Divvy stations.

Chicago Magazine's [Whet Moser spoke to Gaster](http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/July-2014/What-Does-Bike-Share-Data-Tell-Us-About-Chicago), who reportedly works at Datascope Analytics, about the map and what neighborhood traffic patterns it finds. (About the map, Moser concludes the following: "It’s a reminder that modes of transportation do more than take us from Point A to Point B—they shape cities, visibly and invisibly, guiding other modes of transit in their paths.")
