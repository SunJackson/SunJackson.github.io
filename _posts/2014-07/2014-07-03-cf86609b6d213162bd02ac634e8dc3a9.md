LINCOLN SQUARE — Neighborhood [Divvy](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/search?q=divvy) riders aren't in it for the long haul.

At least not according to an [Interactive Divvy Traffic Pattern Map](http://divvy.datasco.pe/), which tracks the most popular destinations for riders setting out from any given station. What the map shows: Lots of folks in Lincoln Square, Ravenswood, North Center and Roscoe Village are taking the distinctive blue bikes out for short spins.

Nearly 10 percent of riders who hopped on a Divvy at the Damen/Sunnyside Divvy dock hopped off at the Lincoln/Eastwood dock. A similar percentage pedaled from Western/Leland to Damen/Leland.

***Lizzie Schiffman explains how the Divvy data could be used to help move bicyclists around Chicago:***

The map was created by [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/) using 2013 data provided by Divvy. As users scroll over a map of the city, Divvy dock locations pop up on their screen, along with information about how riders use that station — total number of trips taken from the station, top-three destinations and a color-coded pattern of where riders went.

Among the interesting patterns that emerged:

• The No. 1 destination from the Lincoln/Leavitt dock (at Sulzer Library) was ... the Lincoln/Leavitt dock. In fact, round-trips — from a station back to the same station — were among the top three destinations for nearly half the area's docks.

• As a point of origin, the Wolcott/Lawrence dock lagged behind its neighbors, but it was a frequent destination for riders from other stations — even before the new Mariano's opened. More riders who left Ravenswood/Berteau wound up at Wolcott/Lawrence than anywhere else.

• There's an exception to every rule. The top destination from Lincoln/Eastwood turned out to be McClurg/Illinois.
