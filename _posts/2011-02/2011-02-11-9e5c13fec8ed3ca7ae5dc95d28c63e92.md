Over the last few years, we have been developing a considerable amount
of infrastructure to enable us to provide faster and cheaper solutions
to our clients without sacrificing our high standards of statistical
methodology and interface aesthetics. Although we have learned many
lessons from this experience, one of the most poignant lessons we have
learned are about the virtues
of pair
programming — the practice of having two programmers (a
"driver" and a "navigator") collaborate on the same programming task
at the same computer. The question is, when does it make more sense
for two people to focus all of their attention on one task rather than
having two people focus on two separate tasks?

**(a) Reusable software.** When you are in the throes of developing
software, particularly software you intend to have several people use
on a daily basis, it is very important to write high-quality code
— code that has an intuitive and elegant user interface (the
[Python language](http://python.org/.) comes to mind). For
even the most experienced programmers, developing exceptional
programmatic user interfaces can be difficult to do, let alone
learn. Working with another programmer makes this process far
easier. You can discuss what things should look like, how you would
like to use the code in the future, and brainstorm ways to make things
extendable for future use. Ultimately, these conversations save a lot
of time that would otherwise be spent by an isolated programmer
refactoring code to make it more usable.



**(b) Crunch time.** When a deadline is rapidly approaching or a
project has an ambitious timeline, it is easy to think that the most
efficient approach is to divide and conquer — split tasks
between two programmers who can cross items off the list in
parallel. The challenge with a divide and conquer strategy is that,
inevitably, one person runs into a bug, usually at the most
inopportune time, which can dramatically impact project timelines and
even hinder the progress of the team. One of the biggest virtues of
pair programming, particularly in a crunch, is that you minimize
debugging time (to close to zero). While the "driver" writes the
software, the "navigator" is constantly checking the approach and
mentally considering possible errors that could arise. As a result,
projects tend to stay on track and substantially reduce the variation
in project time estimates.



**(c) Teamwork.** As with an author's "writer's block," stumbling
blocks are unavoidable in programming; it is commonplace to run into a
seemingly insurmountable problem and get distracted with other things
(how many times do you check your e-mail every day?). These barriers
not only significantly decrease personal productivity, but they also
can serve as a distraction to colleagues. A benefit of pair
programming is that you naturally switch roles — the "driver"
becomes the "navigator" and vice versa — allowing teammates to
solve each others problems and learn from one another. In our
experience, this role switching also serves to keep the pair on task,
ultimately making the team more efficient than you would otherwise
expect.



**(d) All the time.** Are there times when you are not trying to
write reusable software, or that you are not in crunch time, or that
you would not benefit from learning from your peers? Probably, but our
experience suggests that pair programming allows you to
develop *better* code more *reliably*
and *productively*.
