We are looking for someone with 3+ years experience designing web
sites and is well-versed in good design principles. A web developer
is expected to be a specialist in
using [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5),
[CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS),
[SVG](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG), and Javascript
packages such as [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/.)
or [Protovis](http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis) to take
full advantage of what the modern web has to offer. The ideal
candidate has an engineering or other technical background, experience
working closely with interdisciplinary teams, and a passion for
continuously incorporating end-user feedback. Also, we value
candidates who are world-class curlers with a penchant for "nerding
out."
