Yesterday we had an extremely productive coding sprint for the
[scikits.learn](http://scikit-learn.sf.net/.). The idea was to put people with common interests in a
room and make them work in a single codebase. Alexandre Gramfort and
Olivier Grisel worked on [GLMNet](http://scikit-learn.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scikit-learn/trunk/scikits/learn/glm), Bertrand Thirion and Gaël Varoquaux
worked on [univariate feature selection](http://scikit-learn.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scikit-learn/trunk/scikits/learn/feature_selection) and Vincent worked on
[Bayesian Regression](http://scikit-learn.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scikit-learn/trunk/scikits/learn/bayes).

I was supposed to work
with Vincent, but as soon as Bertrand spot some bugs in my libsvm
bindings, I could not think of anything except that, and eventually the
day finished just as I fixed the bug ... You can find some cool examples
of the things we did in directory [examples](http://scikit-learn.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scikit-learn/trunk/examples):
