“Unlike a pure statistician, a data scientist is also expected to write code and understand business. Data science is a multi-disciplinary practice requiring a broad range of knowledge and insight. It’s not unusual for a data scientist to explore a fresh set of data in the morning, create a model before lunch, run a series of analytics in the afternoon and brief a team of digital marketers before heading home at night.” Neera Talbert ( March 16, 2015 )
