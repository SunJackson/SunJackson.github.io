**Point Completion Network (PCN)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Shape completion, the problem of estimating the complete geometry of objects from partial observations, lies at the core of many vision and robotics applications. In this work, we propose Point Completion Network (PCN), a novel learning-based approach for shape completion. Unlike existing shape completion methods, PCN directly operates on raw point clouds without any structural assumption (e.g. symmetry) or annotation (e.g. semantic class) about the underlying shape. It features a decoder design that enables the generation of fine-grained completions while maintaining a small number of parameters. Our experiments show that PCN produces dense, complete point clouds with realistic structures in the missing regions on inputs with various levels of incompleteness and noise, including cars from LiDAR scans in the KITTI dataset. … 

**libDirectional** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we present libDirectional, a MATLAB library for directional statistics and directional estimation. It supports a variety of commonly used distributions on the unit circle, such as the von Mises, wrapped normal, and wrapped Cauchy distributions. Furthermore, various distributions on higher-dimensional manifolds such as the unit hypersphere and the hypertorus are available. Based on these distributions, several recursive filtering algorithms in libDirectional allow estimation on these manifolds. The functionality is implemented in a clear, well-documented, and object-oriented structure that is both easy to use and easy to extend. … 

**Probabilistic Computing** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The MIT Probabilistic Computing Project aims to build software and hardware systems that augment human and machine intelligence. We are currently focused on probabilistic programming. Probabilistic programming is an emerging field that draws on probability theory, programming languages, and systems programming to provide concise, expressive languages for modeling and general-purpose inference engines that both humans and machines can use. Our research projects include BayesDB and Picture, domain-specific probabilistic programming platforms aimed at augmenting intelligence in the fields of data science and computer vision, respectively. BayesDB, which is open source and in use by organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and JPMorgan, lets users who lack statistics training understand the probable implications of data by writing queries in a simple, SQL-like language. Picture, a probabilistic language being developed in collaboration with Microsoft, lets users solve hard computer vision problems such as inferring 3D models of faces, human bodies and novel generic objects from single images by writing short (<50 line) computer graphics programs that generate and render random scenes. Unlike bottom-up vision algorithms, Picture programs build on prior knowledge about scene structure and produce complete 3D wireframes that people can manipulate using ordinary graphics software. The core platform for our research is Venture, an interactive platform suitable for teaching and applications in fields ranging from statistics to robotics.➚ “BayesDB” …
