**Subjective Bayesian Trust (SBT)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper is concerned with trust modeling for networked computing systems. Of particular interest to this paper is the observation that trust is a subjective notion that is invisible, implicit and uncertain in nature, therefore it may be suitable for being expressed by subjective probabilities and then modeled on the basis of Bayesian principle. In spite of a few attempts to model trust in the Bayesian paradigm, the field lacks a global comprehensive overview of Bayesian methods and their theoretical connections to other alternatives. This paper presents a study to fill in this gap. It provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the literature, showing that a large deal of existing work, whether or not proposed based on Bayesian principle, can cast into a general Bayesian paradigm termed subjective Bayesian trust (SBT) theory here. The SBT framework can thus act as a general theoretical infrastructure for comparing or analyzing theoretical ties among existing trust models, and for developing novel models. The aim of this study is twofold. One is to gain insights about Bayesian philosophy in modeling trust. The other is to drive current research step ahead in seeking a high-level, abstract way of modeling and evaluating trust. … 

**Low Algebraic Dimension Matrix Completion (LADMC)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In the low rank matrix completion (LRMC) problem, the low rank assumption means that the columns (or rows) of the matrix to be completed are points on a low-dimensional linear algebraic variety. This paper extends this thinking to cases where the columns are points on a low-dimensional nonlinear algebraic variety, a problem we call Low Algebraic Dimension Matrix Completion (LADMC). Matrices whose columns belong to a union of subspaces (UoS) are an important special case. We propose a LADMC algorithm that leverages existing LRMC methods on a tensorized representation of the data. For example, a second-order tensorization representation is formed by taking the outer product of each column with itself, and we consider higher order tensorizations as well. This approach will succeed in many cases where traditional LRMC is guaranteed to fail because the data are low-rank in the tensorized representation but not in the original representation. We also provide a formal mathematical justification for the success of our method. In particular, we show bounds of the rank of these data in the tensorized representation, and we prove sampling requirements to guarantee uniqueness of the solution. Interestingly, the sampling requirements of our LADMC algorithm nearly match the information theoretic lower bounds for matrix completion under a UoS model. We also provide experimental results showing that the new approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for matrix completion in many situations. … 

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In computer science, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm of making decisions in some decision processes, most notably employed in game playing. The leading example of its use is in contemporary computer Go programs, but it is also used in other board games, as well as real-time video games and non-deterministic games such as poker.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)
