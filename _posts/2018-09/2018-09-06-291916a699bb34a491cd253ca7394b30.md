We want to build agents that can accomplish arbitrary goals in unstructured
complex environments, such as a personal robot that can perform household
chores. A promising approach is to use deep reinforcement learning, which is a
powerful framework for teaching agents to maximize a reward function. However,
the typical reinforcement learning paradigm involves training an agent to solve
an individual task with a manually designed reward. For example, you might train
a robot to set a dinner table by designing a reward function based on the
distance between each plate or utensil and its goal location. This setup
requires a person to design the reward function for each task, as well as extra
systems like object detectors, which can be expensive and brittle. Moreover, if
we want machines that can perform a large repertoire of chores, we would have to
repeat this RL training procedure on each new task.

 While designing reward functions and setting up sensors
 (door angle measurement, object detectors, etc.) may be
 easy in simulation, it quickly becomes impractical in
 the real world (right image).

We train agents to solve various tasks from
vision without extra instrumentation. The top row shows goal images and the
bottom row shows our policies reaching those goals.




In this post, we discuss reinforcement learning algorithms that can be used to
learn multiple different tasks simultaneously, without additional human
supervision. For an agent to acquire skills without human intervention, it must
be able to set goals for itself, interact with the environment, and evaluate
whether it has achieved its goals to improve its behavior, all from raw
observations such as images without manually engineering extra components like
object detectors. We introduce a system that sets abstract goals and
autonomously learns to achieve those goals. We then show that we can use these
autonomously learned skills to perform a variety of user-specified goals, such
as pushing objects, grasping objects, and opening doors, without any additional
learning. Lastly, we demonstrate that our method is efficient enough to work in
the real world on a Sawyer robot. The robot learns to set and achieve goals
involving pushing an object to a specific location, with only images as the
input to the system.


## Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning


How can we represent the state of the world and the goal? In a multi-task
setting, enumerating all of the objects that the robot might need to pay
attention to can become impractical: the number and types of objects might vary,
and detecting them requires a dedicated vision pipeline. Instead, we can
operate directly on the robot's sensors, representing the state as the image
from the robot's camera and the goal as an image of the world as we would like
it to be. To specify a new task, a user simply provides a goal image. We
note that one could extend this work to more complex ways of specifying goals,
such as through language or demonstrations, or by optimizing over goals as in this previous blog post.

 The task: Make the world look like this image.
 



Reinforcement learning is a formalism for training agents to maximize the sum of
rewards. For goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, one choice for the reward
is the negative distance between the current state and the goal state, so that
maximizing the reward corresponds to minimizing the distance to a goal state.



We can train a single policy to maximize rewards and therefore reach goal states
by first learning a * goal-conditioned Q function*. A goal-conditioned Q
function $Q(s, a, g)$ tells us how good an action $a$ is, given the current
state $s$ and goal $g$. For example, a Q function tells us, “How good is it to
move my hand up (action $a$), if I’m holding a plate (state $s$) and want to put
the plate on the table (goal $g$)?” Once this Q function is trained, you can
extract a goal-conditioned policy by performing the following optimization



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/policy-extraction.png)




which effectively says, “choose the best action according to this Q function.”
By using this procedure, we obtain a policy that maximizes the sum of rewards,
i.e. reaches various goals.



One reason that Q learning is popular is that in can be done in an off-policy
manner, meaning that the only things we need to train our Q function are samples
of state, action, next state, goal, and reward: $(s, a, s’, g, r)$. This data
can be collected by any policy and can be reused across multiples tasks. So a
simple goal-conditioned Q-learning algorithm looks like this:



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/ql.png)




The main bottleneck in this training procedure is collecting data. If we could
artificially generate more data, we could in theory learn to solve various tasks
without even interacting with the world. Unfortunately, learning an accurate
model of the world is difficult, so we usually have to rely on sampling to get
state-action-next-state data, $(s, a, s’)$.
However, if we have access to the reward function
$r(s, g)$, we can retroactively relabeled goals and recompute rewards, allowing
us to artificially generate more data given a single $(s, a, s')$ tuple.
So, we can modify this training
procedure like so:



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/qlr.png)




The nice thing about this goal resampling is that we can simultaneously learn
how to reach multiple goals at once without needing more data from the
environment. Overall, this simple modification can result in substantially
faster learning.



The method outlined above makes two major assumptions: (1) you have access to a
reward function and (2) you have access to a goal sampling distribution $p(g)$.
Prior works that use this goal relabeling strategy (

 Kaelbling ‘93
,

 Andrychowicz ‘17
,

 Pong ‘18

) operate on ground truth state information (e.g., the Cartesian
position of an object), where it is easy to manually design both the goal
distribution $p(g)$ and reward function. However, when moving to vision-based
tasks where goals are images, both of these assumptions introduce practical
concerns. For one, it is not clear which reward function we should use, as
pixel-wise distance to a goal image may not be semantically meaningful. Second,
because our goals are images, we need a goal image distribution $p(g)$ from
which we can sample goal images. Manually designing a distribution over goal
images is a non-trivial task and image generation is still an active field of
research. Instead, we would like our agent to autonomously imagine its own goals
and learn how to reach them.


## Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals


We can mitigate the challenges associated with goal-image conditioned Q learning
by learning a representation for images and using this representation, rather
than the images themselves, for RL. The key question becomes: what properties
should our representation satisfy? To compute semantically meaningful rewards,
we need a representation that captures the underlying factors of variations of
images. Furthermore, we need a way to easily generate new goals.



We achieve these objectives by first training a generative latent variable
model, which in our case is a

 variational autoencoder
 (VAE). This generative model
converts high-dimensional observations $x$, like images, into low-dimensional
latent variables $z$, and vice versa. The model is trained so that the latent
variables capture the underlying factors of variation in an image, similar to
the abstract representations a human may use to interpret the world and goals.
Given a current image $x$ and goal image $x_g$, we convert them into latent
variables $z$ and $z_g$ respectively. We then use these latent variables to
representation the state and goal for our reinforcement learning algorithm.
Learning Q functions and policies on top of this low-dimensional latent space
rather than directly on images results in faster learning.



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/robot-interpreting-scene.png)


 The agent encodes the current image ($x$) and goal
 image ($x_g$) into a latent space and use distances in
 that latent space for reward.
 



Using the latent variable representations for the images and goals also solves
another problem: how to compute rewards. Rather than using pixel-wise error as
our reward, we use the distance in the latent space for the reward to train our
agent to reach a goal. In
the full research paper describing our method, we show that this
corresponds to maximizing the probability of reaching the goal and provides a
much more effective learning signal.



This generative model is also important because it allows an agent to easily
generate goals in the latent space. In particular, our generative model is
designed so that sampling latent variables is trivial: we just sample latents
from the VAE prior. We use this sampling mechanism for two reasons: First, it
provides a mechanism for an agent set its own goals. The agent simply samples a
value for the latent variable from our generative model, and tries to reach that
latent goal. Second, this resampling mechanism is also used to relabel goals as
mentioned above. Because our generative model is trained to encode real images
into the prior, the samples from our latent variable prior correspond to
meaningful latent goals.



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/robot-imagining-goals.png)


Even without a human providing a goal, our agent can still generate its own
goals, both for exploration and for goal relabeling.




All together, the latent variable representation of images (1) captures the
underlying factors of a scene, (2) provides meaningful distances to optimize,
and (3) provides an efficient goal sampling mechanism, allowing us to
efficiently train a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning agent that operates
directly on pixels. We call the overall method reinforcement learning with
imagined goals (RIG).


## Experiments


We conducted experiments to test if we RIG would be sample-efficient enough to
train a real world robot policy in a reasonable amount of time. We tested the
robot’s ability to reach user-specified positions and push objects to desired
locations, as indicated by a goal image. The robot is trained with access only
to 84x84 RGB images and without access to joint angles or object positions. The
robot first learns by settings its own goals in the latent space. We can use the
decoder to visualize the goals that the robot imagines for itself. In the GIF
below, the top frame shows the decoded “imagined” goals, while the bottom frame
shows the rollout of the actual policy.



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/real-reaching-vae.gif)


The robot sets its own goals (top) and practices reaching them (bottom).




By setting its own goals, the robot can autonomously practice reaching different
positions without human involvement. The only human involvement is when a person
wants the robot to perform a specific task. At this point, the robot is given a
goal image. Because the robot has practiced reaching so many goals, we see that
it is able to reach this goal without additional training:



![](http://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rig/real-reaching-env.gif)


The human gives a goal image (top) and the robot reaches it (bottom).




 We also used RIG to train a policy to push objects to target
 locations:

Left: The Sawyer robot setup. Right: The human gives a goal image (top) and the
robot reaches it (bottom).




Training a policy directly from images makes it easy to change tasks from
reaching to object pushing. We simply added an object, added a table, and
adjusted the camera. Lastly, despite working directly from pixels, these
experiments did not take long to run. The reaching results took about an hour,
while the pushing results took about 4.5 hours of real-robot interaction time.
Many real-world robot reinforcement learning results use ground-truth state
information like the position of an object. However, this usually requires
additional machinery, like purchasing and setting up extra sensors or training
an object-detection system. In contrast, our method only requires an RGB camera
and works directly from the images.



For more results, including ablations and comparisons to baselines, we encourage
readers to read
the paper.


## Future Directions


We’ve shown that we can train a real-world robot policy directly from images to
achieve a variety of tasks in a sample-efficient way. There are a number of
exciting next steps for this project. It might not be possible to represent all
tasks with a goal image, and one could instead use other modalities, such as
language and demonstrations, to represent goals. Also, while we provide a
mechanism to sample goals for autonomous exploration, can we choose these goals
in a more principled way to perform even better exploration? Incorporating ideas
from intrinsic motivation would allow our policy to actively choose goals that
will inform the policy to learn more quickly about what it can and cannot reach. Another
future direction is to train our generative model so that it is aware of the
dynamics. Encoding information about the environment dynamics could make the
latent space even better suited for reinforcement learning, resulting in faster
learning. Lastly, there are a variety of robot tasks whose state representation
would be difficult to capture with sensors, such as manipulating deformable
objects or handling scenes with variable number of objects. Scaling up RIG to
solve these tasks would be an exciting next step.
