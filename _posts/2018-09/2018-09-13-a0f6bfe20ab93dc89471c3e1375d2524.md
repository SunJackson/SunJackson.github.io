Google released Dataset Search to the world last week. Some asked for my thoughts on the new tool, and as you know, ask and you shall receive.

Plus, finding, gathering, and curating data is often the most tedious and time-consuming part of a visualization project. So anything to speed up the collection process is worth a look.
