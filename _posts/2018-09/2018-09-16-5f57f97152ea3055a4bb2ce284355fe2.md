One thing that is sure to get lost in my *long* note on macros in `R` is just how concise and powerful macros are. The problem is macros are concise, but they do a lot for you. So you get bogged down when you explain the joke.

Let’s try to be concise.




Below is an extension of an example taken from the Programming with `dplyr` note.

First let’s load the package and define our symbols that hold names of columns we wish to work with later.

```
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))

group_nm <- as.name("am")
num_nm <- as.name("hp")
den_nm <- as.name("cyl")
derived_nm <- as.name(paste0(num_nm, "_per_", den_nm))
mean_nm <- as.name(paste0("mean_", derived_nm))
count_nm <- as.name("count")
```

Now let’s use `rlang` to substitute those symbols into a non-trivial `dplyr` pipeline.

```
mtcars %>%
 group_by(!!group_nm) %>%
 mutate(!!derived_nm := !!num_nm/!!den_nm) %>%
 summarize(
 !!mean_nm := mean(!!derived_nm),
 !!count_nm := n()
 ) %>%
 ungroup() %>%
 arrange(!!group_nm)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## am mean_hp_per_cyl count
## <dbl> <dbl> <int>
## 1 0 22.7 19
## 2 1 23.4 13
```

The above is very useful, we have just gotten programmatic control of all the symbol names in a pipeline. This is what is needed to wrap such a pipeline in a function and make it parametric re-usable.

The thing is Thomas Lumley’s `base::bquote()` could achieve this in 2003, and Gregory R. Warnes’ `gtools::strmacro()` could further automate specifying the automation in 2005.

Lets show that. First we use `gtools` to build a "`bquote()` wrapping factory."

```
library("gtools")

# build a method wrapping macro
bq_wrap <- strmacro(
 FN,
 expr = {
 FN <- function(.data, ...) {
 env = parent.frame()
 mc <- substitute(dplyr::FN(.data = .data, ...))
 mc <- do.call(bquote, list(mc, where = env), envir = env)
 eval(mc, envir = env)
 }
 }
)
```

Now we use it to wrap some `dplyr` methods (ignoring non `...` options).

```
# wrap some dplyr methods
bq_wrap(mutate)
bq_wrap(summarize)
bq_wrap(group_by)
bq_wrap(arrange)
```

At this point we have re-adapted 4 `dplyr` methods to use `bquote()` quasiquotation. This is what we mean by `strmacro()` is a tool to build tools.

And here is the same pipeline again, entirely driven by `bquote()`.

```
mtcars %>%
 group_by(.(group_nm)) %>%
 mutate(.(derived_nm) := .(num_nm)/.(den_nm)) %>%
 summarize(
 .(mean_nm) := mean(.(derived_nm)),
 .(count_nm) := n()
 ) %>%
 ungroup() %>%
 arrange(.(group_nm))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## am mean_hp_per_cyl count
## <dbl> <dbl> <int>
## 1 0 22.7 19
## 2 1 23.4 13
```
