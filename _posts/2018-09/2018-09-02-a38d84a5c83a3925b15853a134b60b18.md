I made this quiz where people try to guess ahead of time which results will replicate and which won’t in order to give then a more nuanced understanding of replication issues in psych. Based on this week’s Nature replication paper.
It includes quotes and p-values from the original study if people want to use them, and we offer some broader lessons on what kinds of things replicate and which usually don’t.


You can try the quiz yourself. Also, I have some thoughts about the recent replication paper and its reception—I’m mostly happy with how the paper was covered in the news media, but I think there are a few issues that were missed. I’ll discuss that another time. For now, enjoy the quiz.
