“The end goal of pervasive analytics is simple and will change the way in which the world operates today. By feeding individuals the right information, at the right time, analytics become invisible and embedded into every application and workflow of every user. It is a vision, a goal, a strategy that every individual across every industry can rally around in order to drive the business metrics that matter through the use of data.” TJ Laher ( November 14, 2014 )
