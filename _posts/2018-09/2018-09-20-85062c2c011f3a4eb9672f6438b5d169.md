“Analysts will need a proper understanding of math, statistics, algorithms, and other related sciences in order to deliver meaningful results. They must pair that theoretical knowledge with a firm grasp of the modern-day tools that make the analyses possible. That means having an ability to express queries in terms of MapReduce or some other distributed system, an understanding of how to model data storage across different NoSQL-style systems, and familiarity with libraries that implement common algorithms.” Q Ethan McCallum, Ken Gleason ( 2013 )
