“We now have unsupervised techniques that actually work. The problem is that you can beat them by just collecting more data, and then using supervised learning. This is why in industry, the applications of Deep Learning are currently all supervised. I agree with you that for the search and advertising industry, supervised learning is used because of the vast amounts of data being generated and gathered.” Yann LeCun ( 2015 )
