A colleague sent along this article and writes:

Yup, it’s horrible. I don’t know that I’d call it cargo cult science at its absolute *worst*, but it’s pretty bad.

(The full story, for those who are not familiar, is that p-values are super-noisy—see, for example, the first full paragraph on page 5 of this article, hence summarizing a study by statistically significant p-values is a criminally wasteful presentation of results.)
