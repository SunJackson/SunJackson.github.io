In 2018, the field of data science continues to expand at a pace previously unseen in all but the Full Stack Web Development cycle. As a result of faster processing chips and more readable programming languages, including package updates, today data science is becoming available for both consumers and professionals.

If you are looking to begin your journey in Data Science, the amount of resources available expands beyond any time that you would have available to master all the programming languages. Therefore, as a result of delivery in data science bootcamps including artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data engineering programs to more than 2,000 students, I will offer languages for your consideration on your data science journey.

In no particular order, some of the top programming languages in 2018 include:

1. **Java** is known to be the best choice for someone thinking of starting as a developer. This is because Java is quite simple and readable programming language. If someone needs to build large systems then probably java is the best choice. Java is emerging as the programming language of choice all around the world for developers. Some important points of interest are-


- Java is a functional programming language that is used for extensive coding.

- Its strength is accuracy and precision.

- Best suitable for the development of applications.

- The only weakness which it has is an inefficient architecture code.


1. **Python** is prioritized more over Java by the machine learning scientists who work on sentiment analysis.


Apart from its use in web development python shows its importance in data mining, scientific computing, and others. Python is broad and flexible so most of the developers prefer to use python as a programming language. The modern-day applications like Instagram and Pinterest are built using python. In the US at academic levels, it is becoming popular and been taught as a programming language. Some important points are:

- Python is a general-purpose language which helps in bringing the production system into operations.

- It is best suited for the development of applications.

- Strength is the accuracy and precision.

- Weakness includes inefficient architecture code.


1. **R language**: R is a statistical computing and graphics based programming language. One can explore model and prototype with R. It is used mostly to unlock the patterns in large blocks of data and it makes the work of scientists easier. Google, Facebook, Bank of America and the New York Times all use R and its commercial utility is spreading. Important points to be kept in mind –


- Purpose built language for statistical computing.

- It is best suited for comprehension and exploration of statistical data.

- Strength is numerous machine language algorithms by default.

- Weakness is lesser perfect packaging.


1. **MATLAB** is a numerical computing language developed and licensed by maths work which is established in 1984. As per 2017 calculations, MATLAB has 1 million users who came from various backgrounds of engineering, economics, and science.


- Basically, it is designed for numerical computing. It is written in c, c++ and Java.

- This language also has plotting capabilities.


1. **Scala** is a scalable language and is organized to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). According to a 2015 data science salary survey, the use of Scala programming language for data science has been on a year over year increase of 10% usage. Scala is a rival of Java and Python in the data Scientist's toolkit.


- Scala is a general-purpose language hence it best choice for those working with high volume data sets.

- Scala supports both OOP and functional programming.

- Scala can be used to write web apps. It can compile to web script.



The **C language** is the oldest language amongst other programming languages. C language is considered as the mother of all languages and it is an essential programming language to build predictive algorithms. Many more languages are inherited from C like C++, Java, JavaScript, and C #, PHP, Perl in some way or other.


**SQL** stands for structured query language. SQL is one of the favorite among all the data science dwellers.


- It is used to deal large databases.

- It came into existence in 1974.

- The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation, and data access control and data definition.
