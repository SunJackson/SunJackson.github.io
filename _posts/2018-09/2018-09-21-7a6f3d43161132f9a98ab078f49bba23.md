**Higher-order Graph Convolutional Networks**

Following the success of deep convolutional networks in various vision and speech related tasks, researchers have started investigating generalizations of the well-known technique for graph-structured data. A recently-proposed method called Graph Convolutional Networks has been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in the task of node classification. However, since the proposed method relies on localized first-order approximations of spectral graph convolutions, it is unable to capture higher-order interactions between nodes in the graph. In this work, we propose a motif-based graph attention model, called Motif Convolutional Networks (MCNs), which generalizes past approaches by using weighted multi-hop motif adjacency matrices to capture higher-order neighborhoods. A novel attention mechanism is used to allow each individual node to select the most relevant neighborhood to apply its filter. Experiments show that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on the semi-supervised node classification task.

**On the Fly Orchestration of Unikernels: Tuning and Performance Evaluation of Virtual Infrastructure Managers**

Network operators are facing significant challenges meeting the demand for more bandwidth, agile infrastructures, innovative services, while keeping costs low. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Cloud Computing are emerging as key trends of 5G network architectures, providing flexibility, fast instantiation times, support of Commercial Off The Shelf hardware and significant cost savings. NFV leverages Cloud Computing principles to move the data-plane network functions from expensive, closed and proprietary hardware to the so-called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). In this paper we deal with the management of virtual computing resources (Unikernels) for the execution of VNFs. This functionality is performed by the Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) in the NFV MANagement and Orchestration (MANO) reference architecture. We discuss the instantiation process of virtual resources and propose a generic reference model, starting from the analysis of three open source VIMs, namely OpenStack, Nomad and OpenVIM. We improve the aforementioned VIMs introducing the support for special-purpose Unikernels and aiming at reducing the duration of the instantiation process. We evaluate some performance aspects of the VIMs, considering both stock and tuned versions. The VIM extensions and performance evaluation tools are available under a liberal open source licence.

**Design and Implementation of High-throughput PCIe with DMA Architecture between FPGA and PowerPC**

We designed and implemented a direct memory access (DMA) architecture of PCI-Express(PCIe) between Xilinx Field Program Gate Array(FPGA) and Freescale PowerPC. The DMA architecture based on FPGA is compatible with the Xilinx PCIe core while the DMA architecture based on POWERPC is compatible with VxBus of VxWorks. The solutions provide a high-performance and low-occupancy alternative to commercial. In order to maximize the PCIe throughput while minimizing the FPGA resources utilization, the DMA engine adopts a novel strategy where the DMA register list is stored both inside the FPGA during initialization phase and inside the central memory of the host CPU. The FPGA design package is complemented with simple register access to control the DMA engine by a VxWorks driver. The design is compatible with Xilinx FPGA Kintex Ultrascale Family, and operates with the Xilinx PCIe endpoint Generation 1 with lane configurations x8. A data throughput of more than 666 MBytes/s(memory write with data from FPGA to PowerPC) has been achieved with the single PCIe Gen1 x8 lanes endpoint of this design, PowerPC and FPGA can send memory write request to each other.

**An Efficient Approximation Algorithm for Multi-criteria Indoor Route Planning Queries**

A route planning query has many real-world applications and has been studied extensively in outdoor spaces such as road networks or Euclidean space. Despite its many applications in indoor venues (e.g., shopping centres, libraries, airports), almost all existing studies are specifically designed for outdoor spaces and do not take into account unique properties of the indoor spaces such as hallways, stairs, escalators, rooms etc. We identify this research gap and formally define the problem of category aware multi-criteria route planning query, denoted by CAM, which returns the optimal route from an indoor source point to an indoor target point that passes through at least one indoor point from each given category while minimizing the total cost of the route in terms of travel distance and other relevant attributes. We show that CAM query is NP-hard. Based on a novel dominance-based pruning, we propose an efficient algorithm which generates high-quality results. We provide an extensive experimental study conducted on the largest shopping centre in Australia and compare our algorithm with alternative approaches. The experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is highly efficient and produces quality results.

**Investigating Linguistic Pattern Ordering in Hierarchical Natural Language Generation**

Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component in spoken dialogue system, which can be divided into two phases: (1) sentence planning: deciding the overall sentence structure, (2) surface realization: determining specific word forms and flattening the sentence structure into a string. With the rise of deep learning, most modern NLG models are based on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which basically contains an encoder-decoder structure; these NLG models generate sentences from scratch by jointly optimizing sentence planning and surface realization. However, such simple encoder-decoder architecture usually fail to generate complex and long sentences, because the decoder has difficulty learning all grammar and diction knowledge well. This paper introduces an NLG model with a hierarchical attentional decoder, where the hierarchy focuses on leveraging linguistic knowledge in a specific order. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional seq2seq model with a smaller model size, and the design of the hierarchical attentional decoder can be applied to various NLG systems. Furthermore, different generation strategies based on linguistic patterns are investigated and analyzed in order to guide future NLG research work.

**A Dataset for Document Grounded Conversations**

This paper introduces a document grounded dataset for text conversations. We define ‘Document Grounded Conversations’ as conversations that are about the contents of a specified document. In this dataset the specified documents were Wikipedia articles about popular movies. The dataset contains 4112 conversations with an average of 21.43 turns per conversation. This positions this dataset to not only provide a relevant chat history while generating responses but also provide a source of information that the models could use. We describe two neural architectures that provide benchmark performance on the task of generating the next response. We also evaluate our models for engagement and fluency, and find that the information from the document helps in generating more engaging and fluent responses.

**Learning, Planning, and Control in a Monolithic Neural Event Inference Architecture**

We introduce a dynamic artificial neural network-based (ANN) adaptive inference process, which learns temporal predictive models of dynamical systems. We term the process REPRISE, a REtrospective and PRospective Inference SchEme. REPRISE infers the unobservable contextual state that best explains its recently encountered sensorimotor experiences as well as accompanying, context-dependent temporal predictive models retrospectively. Meanwhile, it executes prospective inference, optimizing upcoming motor activities in a goal-directed manner. In a first implementation, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to learn a temporal forward model, which predicts the sensorimotor contingencies of different simulated dynamic vehicles. The RNN is augmented with contextual neurons, which enable the compact encoding of distinct, but related sensorimotor dynamics. We show that REPRISE is able to concurrently learn to separate and approximate the encountered sensorimotor dynamics. Moreover, we show that REPRISE can exploit the learned model to induce goal-directed, model-predictive control, that is, approximate active inference: Given a goal state, the system imagines a motor command sequence optimizing it with the prospective objective to minimize the distance to a given goal. Meanwhile, the system evaluates the encountered sensorimotor contingencies retrospectively, adapting its neural hidden states for maintaining model coherence. The RNN activities thus continuously imagine the upcoming future and reflect on the recent past, optimizing both, hidden state and motor activities. In conclusion, the combination of temporal predictive structures with modulatory, generative encodings offers a way to develop compact event codes, which selectively activate particular types of sensorimotor event-specific dynamics.

**Bias corrected minimum distance estimator for short and long memory processes**

This work proposes a new minimum distance estimator (MDE) for the parameters of short and long memory models. This bias corrected minimum distance estimator (BCMDE) considers a correction in the usual MDE to account for the bias of the sample autocorrelation function when the mean is unknown. We prove the weak consistency of the BCMDE for the general fractional autoregressive moving average (ARFIMA(p, d, q)) model and derive its asymptotic distribution for some particular cases. Simulation studies show that the BCMDE presents a good performance compared to other procedures frequently used in the literature, such as the maximum likelihood estimator, the Whittle estimator and the MDE. The results also show that the BCMDE presents, in general, the smallest mean squared error and is less biased than the MDE when the mean is a non-trivial function of time.

**Towards Accountable AI: Hybrid Human-Machine Analyses for Characterizing System Failure**

As machine learning systems move from computer-science laboratories into the open world, their accountability becomes a high priority problem. Accountability requires deep understanding of system behavior and its failures. Current evaluation methods such as single-score error metrics and confusion matrices provide aggregate views of system performance that hide important shortcomings. Understanding details about failures is important for identifying pathways for refinement, communicating the reliability of systems in different settings, and for specifying appropriate human oversight and engagement. Characterization of failures and shortcomings is particularly complex for systems composed of multiple machine learned components. For such systems, existing evaluation methods have limited expressiveness in describing and explaining the relationship among input content, the internal states of system components, and final output quality. We present Pandora, a set of hybrid human-machine methods and tools for describing and explaining system failures. Pandora leverages both human and system-generated observations to summarize conditions of system malfunction with respect to the input content and system architecture. We share results of a case study with a machine learning pipeline for image captioning that show how detailed performance views can be beneficial for analysis and debugging.

**Ranking Distillation: Learning Compact Ranking Models With High Performance for Recommender System**

We propose a novel way to train ranking models, such as recommender systems, that are both effective and efficient. Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called \emph{ranking distillation (RD)}. Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has a model size less than half of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar to the teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD.

**A Coupled Evolutionary Network for Age Estimation**

Age estimation of unknown persons is a challenging pattern analysis task due to the lacking of training data and various aging mechanisms for different people. Label distribution learning-based methods usually make distribution assumptions to simplify age estimation. However, age label distributions are often complex and difficult to be modeled in a parameter way. Inspired by the biological evolutionary mechanism, we propose a Coupled Evolutionary Network (CEN) with two concurrent evolutionary processes: evolutionary label distribution learning and evolutionary slack regression. Evolutionary network learns and refines age label distributions in an iteratively learning way. Evolutionary label distribution learning adaptively learns and constantly refines the age label distributions without making strong assumptions on the distribution patterns. To further utilize the ordered and continuous information of age labels, we accordingly propose an evolutionary slack regression to convert the discrete age label regression into the continuous age interval regression. Experimental results on Morph, ChaLearn15 and MegaAge-Asian datasets show the superiority of our method.

**Time is of the Essence: Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection in Industrial Time Series Data**

The Industrial Internet of Things drastically increases connectivity of devices in industrial applications. In addition to the benefits in efficiency, scalability and ease of use, this creates novel attack surfaces. Historically, industrial networks and protocols do not contain means of security, such as authentication and encryption, that are made necessary by this development. Thus, industrial IT-security is needed. In this work, emulated industrial network data is transformed into a time series and analysed with three different algorithms. The data contains labeled attacks, so the performance can be evaluated. Matrix Profiles perform well with almost no parameterisation needed. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average performs well in the presence of noise, requiring parameterisation effort. Long Short Term Memory-based neural networks perform mediocre while requiring a high training- and parameterisation effort.

**DuPLO: A DUal view Point deep Learning architecture for time series classificatiOn**

Nowadays, modern Earth Observation systems continuously generate huge amounts of data. A notable example is represented by the Sentinel-2 mission, which provides images at high spatial resolution (up to 10m) with high temporal revisit period (every 5 days), which can be organized in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). While the use of SITS has been proved to be beneficial in the context of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map generation, unfortunately, machine learning approaches commonly leveraged in remote sensing field fail to take advantage of spatio-temporal dependencies present in such data. Recently, new generation deep learning methods allowed to significantly advance research in this field. These approaches have generally focused on a single type of neural network, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which model different but complementary information: spatial autocorrelation (CNNs) and temporal dependencies (RNNs). In this work, we propose the first deep learning architecture for the analysis of SITS data, namely \method{} (DUal view Point deep Learning architecture for time series classificatiOn), that combines Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks to exploit their complementarity. Our hypothesis is that, since CNNs and RNNs capture different aspects of the data, a combination of both models would produce a more diverse and complete representation of the information for the underlying land cover classification task. Experiments carried out on two study sites characterized by different land cover characteristics (i.e., the \textit{Gard} site in France and the \textit{Reunion Island} in the Indian Ocean), demonstrate the significance of our proposal.

**Sparsified SGD with Memory**

Huge scale machine learning problems are nowadays tackled by distributed optimization algorithms, i.e. algorithms that leverage the compute power of many devices for training. The communication overhead is a key bottleneck that hinders perfect scalability. Various recent works proposed to use quantization or sparsification techniques to reduce the amount of data that needs to be communicated, for instance by only sending the most significant entries of the stochastic gradient (top-k sparsification). Whilst such schemes showed very promising performance in practice, they have eluded theoretical analysis so far. In this work we analyze Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with k-sparsification or compression (for instance top-k or random-k) and show that this scheme converges at the same rate as vanilla SGD when equipped with error compensation (keeping track of accumulated errors in memory). That is, communication can be reduced by a factor of the dimension of the problem (sometimes even more) whilst still converging at the same rate. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical findings and the better scalability for distributed applications.

**Spline-Based Probability Calibration**

In many classification problems it is desirable to output well-calibrated probabilities on the different classes. We propose a robust, non-parametric method of calibrating probabilities called SplineCalib that utilizes smoothing splines to determine a calibration function. We demonstrate how applying certain transformations as part of the calibration process can improve performance on problems in deep learning and other domains where the scores tend to be ‘overconfident’. We adapt the approach to multi-class problems and find that better calibration can improve accuracy as well as log-loss by better resolving uncertain cases. Finally, we present a cross-validated approach to calibration which conserves data. Significant improvements to log-loss and accuracy are shown on several different problems. We also introduce the ml-insights python package which contains an implementation of the SplineCalib algorithm.

**PriPeARL: A Framework for Privacy-Preserving Analytics and Reporting at LinkedIn**

Preserving privacy of users is a key requirement of web-scale analytics and reporting applications, and has witnessed a renewed focus in light of recent data breaches and new regulations such as GDPR. We focus on the problem of computing robust, reliable analytics in a privacy-preserving manner, while satisfying product requirements. We present PriPeARL, a framework for privacy-preserving analytics and reporting, inspired by differential privacy. We describe the overall design and architecture, and the key modeling components, focusing on the unique challenges associated with privacy, coverage, utility, and consistency. We perform an experimental study in the context of ads analytics and reporting at LinkedIn, thereby demonstrating the tradeoffs between privacy and utility needs, and the applicability of privacy-preserving mechanisms to real-world data. We also highlight the lessons learned from the production deployment of our system at LinkedIn.
