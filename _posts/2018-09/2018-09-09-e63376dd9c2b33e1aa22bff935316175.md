“Start small and go big: Analytical projects should not be planned across an entire company, or even division-wide. Initial pilots should focus on small, identifiable challenges and work to resolve those challenges. Once a project has been successfully piloted and measured, other teams within the organization will see the value in the new analytical technologies, and also understand the organizational changes required to adopt a new mindset and technology.” Dell ( 2014 )
