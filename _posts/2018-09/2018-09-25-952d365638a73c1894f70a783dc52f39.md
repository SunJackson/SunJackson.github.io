**Dyadic Data** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Dyadic data refers to a domain with two nite sets of objects in which observations are made for dyads, i.e., pairs with one element from either set. This type of data arises naturally in many application ranging from computational linguistics and information retrieval to preference analysis and computer vision. In this paper, we present a systematic, domain-independent framework of learning from dyadic data by statistical mixture models. Our approach covers different models with flat and hierarchical latent class structures. We propose an annealed version of the standard EM algorithm for model fitting which is empirically evaluated on a variety of data sets from different domains.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Adjacency Diagram** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The adjacency diagram is a space-filling variant of the node-link diagram; rather than drawing a link between parent and child in the hierarchy, nodes are drawn as solid areas (either arcs or bars), and their placement relative to adjacent nodes reveals their position in the hierarchy. The icicle layout in figure 4D is similar to the first node-link diagram in that the root node appears at the top, with child nodes underneath. Because the nodes are now space-filling, however, we can use a length encoding for the size of software classes and packages. This reveals an additional dimension that would be difficult to show in a node-link diagram. …
