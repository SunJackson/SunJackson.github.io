## AI Summit

With the future of AI in mind, the AI Summit at re:Invent showcases the latest in research and emerging trends. In 30-minute Lightning Talks, leaders in the research community will share their perspectives on everything from AI-fueled cancer research to quantum computing. The AI Summit will be held on Tuesday, November 27th, from 1:00pm to 5:30pm at the Venetian Theater. Visit the session catalog to register for the event.

**The Future of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic**(Session AIS301)*****Alexandre Bayen, UC Berkeley*

How will self-driving cars change urban mobility patterns? This talk will examine scientific contributions in the field of reinforcement learning, presented in the context of enabling mixed-autonomy mobility—the gradual and complex integration of autonomous vehicles into existing traffic systems. The potential impact of a small fraction of autonomous vehicles on low-level traffic flow dynamics will be explored, using novel techniques in model-free deep reinforcement learning. Examples will be presented in the context of a new open-source computational platform and state-of-the-art microsimulation tools with deep-reinforcement libraries.

**Intelligent Systems for Cancer Genomics**(Session AIS301)*****Mona Singh, Princeton University *

One of the most exciting frontiers in science is to build automated systems that use existing biomedical data to understand and ultimately treat human disease. The key difficulty in the case of cancer is that it is a highly heterogeneous disease, making it challenging to uncover which molecular alterations in tumors are important for disease and to predict how an individual will respond to treatment. This talk will present an overview of integrative computational methods for analyzing cancer genomes that leverage a diverse range of complementary data in order to extract biomedically relevant insights.

**Delivering on the Promise of AI Together**(Session AIS301)*****Rohit Prasad, Amazon AI*

We are living in a golden age of artificial intelligence (AI). Machines have already surpassed humans in some specific tasks, including image and speech recognition, thanks to the power of cloud computing, the abundance of data required to train AI systems, and improvements in foundational AI algorithms. While some express fear about the potential for AI systems to increasingly overtake the role of humans, together we should influence how these systems can improve every aspect of our lives. Join Rohit Prasad as he explores the opportunities for AI systems to augment human intelligence in ways that will make it accessible to everyone for societal good today and into the future.

**Pragmatic Quantum Machine Learning Today**(Session AIS301)*Peter Wittek, University of Toronto*

Quantum computing’s theoretical potential to exponentially speed up deep learning stands in sharp contrast to the current reality. Implementations are imperfect, suffering from noise and poor coherence times, and scalability limitations. In this talk, we’ll explore how quantum-enhanced machine learning plays a complementary role to classical techniques, rather than acting as a replacement. We’ll discuss relevant computing paradigms such as quantum annealing and gate-model quantum computing over discrete or continuous variables that are performed efficiently with hybrid classical-quantum protocols.

**Unbiased Learning from Biased User Feedback**(Session AIS301)*****Thorsten Joachims, Cornell University*

Logged user interactions are one of the most ubiquitous forms of data available, as they can be recorded from a variety of systems (e.g. search engines, recommender systems, ad placement) at little cost. Naively using this data, however, is prone to failure. A key problem lies in biases that systems inject into the logs by influencing where we will receive feedback (e.g. more clicks at the top of the search ranking). This talk will explore how counterfactual inference techniques can make learning algorithms robust against bias. This makes log data accessible to a broad range of learning algorithms, from Ranking SVMs to Deep Networks.

**Designing for a Data-Driven Economy**(Session AIS301)*Jodi Forlizzi, Carnegie Mellon University*

The abundance of data available today has been described as a sea change and its own economy. Data has enabled new products, services, businesses, and economies. How can designers thrive as data-savvy innovators in this new economy? What do designers need to know about data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence? In this talk, Jodi Forlizzi will draw from multiple research and development efforts to present relevant findings about how to design in a new data-driven economy.

**Making Aerial Micro-Drones a Reality**(Session AIS301)*****Shyam Gollakota, University of Washington*

The concept of insect-scale aerial drones has long been in the realm of science fiction rather than reality, especially since powering such small drones is fundamentally difficult. In this talk, Shyam Gollakota will share his work on RoboFly, the first honeybee-sized wireless drone to successfully lift off. He will also discuss an alternative biology-based solution that integrates sensing, computing, and communication functions onto live-flying bumblebees. Data generated from this mobile IoT platform can feed AI models that have the potential to generate valuable intelligence for applications ranging from precision irrigation to environmental sensing.
