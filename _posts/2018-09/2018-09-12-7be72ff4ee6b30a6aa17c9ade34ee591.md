**AlphaX** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present AlphaX, a fully automated agent that designs complex neural architectures from scratch. AlphaX explores the exponentially exploded search space with a novel distributed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Meta-Deep Neural Network (DNN). MCTS intrinsically improves the search efficiency by automatically balancing the exploration and exploitation at each state, while Meta-DNN predicts the network accuracy to guide the search, and to provide an estimated reward for the preemptive backpropagation in the distributed setup. As the search progresses, AlphaX also generates the training date for Meta-DNN. So, the learning of Meta-DNN is end-to-end. In searching for NASNet style architectures, AlphaX found several promising architectures with up to 1% higher accuracy than NASNet using only 17 GPUs for 5 days, demonstrating up to 23.5x speedup over the original searching for NASNet that used 500 GPUs in 4 days. … 

**Gaussian Means (G-Means)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to refine the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. …
