In an earlier post, we explored how several top teams at this year’s Imagine Cup had Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the core of their winning solutions. From helping farmers identify and manage crop disease to helping the hearing-impaired, this year’s finalists tackled difficult problems that affect people from all walks of life.

In a new post, we take a closer look at the champion project of Imagine Cup 2018, smartARM.

See how the unexpected combination of a 3D-printed prosthetic arm, a camera embedded in its palm, cloud connectivity and easy access to state-of-the-art AI algorithms allowed let a team of undergraduate students from Canada to accomplish something rather remarkable.

We are just scratching the surface in terms of the types of medical and healthcare breakthroughs that may result from the application of AI.

As Joseph Sirosh, Corporate Vice President and CTO of AI at Microsoft rightly puts it, “Imagine a future where all assistive devices are infused with AI and designed to work with you. That could have tremendous positive impact on the quality of people’s lives, all over the world.”
