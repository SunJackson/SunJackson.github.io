Data Science has been hailed as the transformative trend that is set to re-wire the industries and re-invent the ways people do things. Products and applications are being developed in agriculture, healthcare, urban planning, trade, commerce, finance, and the possibilities are growing.

It has been a buzzword for a while now with more people aiming to look ahead for the career opportunities it provides. If you are looking for a career change to data science or you want to build a career in it or you are really passionate about it, then Dimensionless Technologies has some great courses just for you.

Data Science is an umbrella term which is used to describe pretty much everything, from data engineering to data processing to data analysis to machine learning, pattern recognition, and deep learning.

Dimensionless provides online data science training that provides in-depth course coverage, case study based learning, entirely Hands-on driven sessions with personalized attention to every participant. We provide only instructor-led LIVE online training sessions and not classroom training.

You can have a sneak peek into how classes are conducted which will help you make a wiser choiceDemo tutorial: Link

### Why Dimensionless Technologies?

Dimensionless Technologies provide instructor-led LIVE online training with hands-on different problems. We do not provide classroom training but we deliver more as compared to what a classroom training could provide you with

Are you skeptical of online training or you feel that online mode is not the best platform to learn? Let us clear your insecurities about online training!

1. **Live and Interactive sessions**We conduct classes through live sessions and not pre-recorded videos. The interactivity level is similar to classroom training and you get it in the comfort of your home. If you miss any class or didn’t understand some concepts, you can’t go through the class again. However, in online courses, it’s possible to do that. We share the recordings of all our classes after each class with the student. Also, there’s no hassle of long-distance commuting and disrupting your schedule.

1. **Highly Experienced Faculty**We have very highly experienced faculty with us (IIT`ians) to help you grasp complex concepts and kick-start your career success journey

1. **Up to Data Course content**Our course content is up to date which involves all the latest technologies and tools. Our course is well equipped for learners to grasp the knowledge required to solve real-world problems through their data analytical skills

1. **Availability of software and computing resource**Any laptop with 2GB RAM and Windows 7 and above is perfectly fine for this course. All the software used in this course are Freely downloadable from the Internet. The trainers help you set it up in your systems. We also provide access to our Cloud-based online lab where these are already installed.

1. **Industry-Based Projects**During the training, you will be solving multiple case studies from different domains. Once the LIVE training is done, you will start implementing your learnings on Real Time Datasets. You can work on data from various domains like Retail, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Operations, Telecom, Oil and Gas and many more. You would be working on multiple projects so that you can gain enough content and confidence to enter into the field of Data Science.

1. **Course Completion Certificate**Yes, we will be issuing a course completion certificate to all individuals who successfully complete the training.

1. **Placement Assistance**We provide you with real-time industry requirements on a daily basis through our connection in the industry. These requirements generally come through referral channels, hence the probability to get through increases manifold.
