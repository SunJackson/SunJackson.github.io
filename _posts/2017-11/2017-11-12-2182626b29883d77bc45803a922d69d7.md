Last week we crossed the one year mark after president’s election. Both in calendar days, November the 8th, and in terms of trading days – 252 (the average number of trading days per calendar year). I wanted to do a brief recap before leaving it to rest.



October is known to be a bad month on average for equities. It did impact significantly our “race” as well. [About three weeks ago](http://www.quintuitive.com/2017/10/16/markets-performance-election), we saw the President Clinton’s 2nd term rally and President H.W. Bush’s holding the top spots. By a considerable margin. Nevertheless, [just a week later](http://www.quintuitive.com/2017/10/21/markets-performance-election-day-239), we saw President Bush’s rally losing its second spot due to [Friday the 13th mini-crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_mini-crash). The very next week, President Clinton’s market suffered [its own mini-crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_27,_1997,_mini-crash) and gave away a substantial number of percentage points. So …

No significant turbulence for the current rally in October, and with a healthy **28%** it crossed the one year mark on top.

A couple of points on the methodology (please review [the R code](https://gist.github.com/ivannp/f989a2d25f4efbbbb9d547767fdd15c0) if interested):

- I use day count since election to overlap the rallies, not calendar dates.

- The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the data I used. The performance on the S&P 500 is different.


The current market rally is in fact the 2nd best ever, going back to 1928. President Roosevelt’s rally dwarfs anything in modern history:

And Indeed, the market was simply starting to bounce back from the bottom of the devastating great depression, the biggest market collapse. To get a perspective:

Yep, that “little” blip at the end is the **enormous 46%** rally during President’s Roosevelt’s first year in office. In fact, it will take another 22 years before the market reaches a new high! For comparison, both the current rally and President Clinton’s rally have been operating in record high territory.
