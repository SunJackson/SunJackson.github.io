I've recently written a couple of guest blog posts about data science in the healthcare space.

The first is a pretty general article about some of the challenges and opportunities for data science and predictive analytics in healthcare. You can find it [here](https://data-science-blog.com/blog/2017/09/04/data-science-and-predictive-analytics-in-healthcare).

The second one is about the importance of domain knowledge in data science, with a focus again on healthcare. It talks about why domain knowledge is important, and ideas of how to get it if you (like me) are a data science without a medical background working in healthcare. Find that one [here](https://data-science-blog.com/blog/2017/11/10/the-importance-of-domain-knowledge-a-healthcare-data-science-perspective).
