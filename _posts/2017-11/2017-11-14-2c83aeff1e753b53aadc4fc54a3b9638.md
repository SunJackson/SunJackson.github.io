I've recently written a couple of guest blog posts about data science in the healthcare space.

The first is a pretty general article about some of the challenges and opportunities for data science and predictive analytics in healthcare. You can find it here.

The second one is about the importance of domain knowledge in data science, with a focus again on healthcare. It talks about why domain knowledge is important, and ideas of how to get it if you (like me) are a data science without a medical background working in healthcare. Find that one here.
