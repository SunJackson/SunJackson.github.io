A week back I had the pleasure to talk on machine learning at [PyConUK 2017](http://2017.pyconuk.org/schedule) in the inaugural [PyDataCardiff](https://twitter.com/pydatacardiff) track. [Tim Vivian-Griffiths](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timviviangriffiths) and colleagues did a wonderful job building our second PyData conference event in the UK. The PyConUK conference just keeps getting better – 700 folk, 5 tracks, a huge kids track and lots of sub-events. Pythontastic! Cat Lamin has a [lovely write-up](https://catlamin.com/2017/10/31/pyconuk-2017) of the main conference.

If you’re interested in PyDataCardiff then note that Tim has [setup an announcements-list](https://twitter.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=74b8329fc3e2447a62205718d&id=386a82b40d), join it to hear about meetup events around Cardiff and Bristol.

I [spoke](https://twitter.com/pydatacardiff/status/924276483950022656) on the [Saturday](https://twitter.com/alexchamberlain/status/924274989435637765) on “Machine Learning Libraries You’d Wish You’d Known About” ([slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/ianozsvald/machine-learning-libraries-youd-wish-youd-known-about)) – this is a precis of topics that I figured out this year:

- Using Pandas multi-core with [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest)

- Automating your machine learning with [TPOT](https://rhiever.github.io/tpot) on sklearn

- Visualising your machine learning with [YellowBrick](http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest)

- Explaining *why* you get certain machine learning answers with [ELI5](http://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)

- See my [“Explaining Regression” Notebook](https://github.com/ianozsvald/data_science_delivered/blob/master/ml_explain_regression_prediction.ipynb) for lots of examples with YellowBrick, ELI5, LIME and more (I used this to build my talk)

As with last year I was speaking in part to existing engineers who are ML-curious, to show ways of approaching machine learning diagnosis with an engineer’s-mindset. Last year I [introduced Random Forests for engineers](http://ianozsvald.com/2016/09/23/practical-ml-for-engineers-talk-at-pyconuk-last-weekend) using a worked example. Below you’ll find for video for this year’s talk:

I’m planning to do more teaching on data science and Python in 2018 – if this might interest you, please join my [training mailing list](http://modelinsight.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=833cadbc54533d1da7935054c&id=2ab4cc9311). Posts will go out rarely to announce new public and private training sessions that’ll run in the UK.

At the end of my talk I made a request of the audience, I’m going to start doing this more frequently. My request was “please send me a physical postcard if I taught you something” – I’d love to build up some evidence on my wall that these talks are useful. I received my first postcard a few days back, I’m rather stoked. Thank you Pieter! If you want to send me a postcard, just send me an email. Do please remember to thank your speakers – it is a tiny gesture that really carries weight.

Thanks to O’Reilly I also got to [participate](https://twitter.com/prabhantsingh/status/924470239143890945) in another [High Performance Python](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7483262-11260198?url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.oreilly.com%2Fproduct%2F0636920028963.do%3Fcmp%3Daf-strata-books-videos-product_cj_9781491900727_%2525zp&cjsku=0636920028963) [signing](https://twitter.com/ianozsvald/status/924241390439149568), this time with Steve Holden ([Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/144939292X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=144939292X&linkCode=as2&tag=entrepreneuri-21&linkId=459dd53f8df3ff08063ca987175ad354)), Harry Percival ([Test-Driven Development with Python 2e](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1491958707/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1491958707&linkCode=as2&tag=entrepreneuri-21&linkId=7255492f735626b461587200e4c743d7)) and Nicholas Tollervy ([Programming with MicroPython](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1491972734/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1491972734&linkCode=as2&tag=entrepreneuri-21&linkId=bfb33c8fded08812b1802fdfe5ff3e72)):

I want to say a huge thanks to everyone I met – I look forward to a bigger and better PyConUK and PyDataCardiff next year!

If you like data science and you’re in the UK, please do check-out our [PyDataLondon meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup). If you’re after a job, I have a data scientist’s [jobs list](http://ianozsvald.com/2016/01/12/data-scientist-jobs-in-london).
