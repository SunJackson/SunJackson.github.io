## Introduction

Consider speech recognition. We have a dataset of audio clips and
corresponding transcripts. Unfortunately, we don’t know how the characters in
the transcript align to the audio. This makes training a speech recognizer
harder than it might at first seem.

Without this alignment, the simple approaches aren’t available to us. We
could devise a rule like “one character corresponds to ten inputs”. But
people’s rates of speech vary, so this type of rule can always be broken.
Another alternative is to hand-align each character to its location in the
audio. From a modeling standpoint this works well — we’d know the ground truth
for each input time-step. However, for any reasonably sized dataset this is
prohibitively time consuming.

This problem doesn’t just turn up in speech recognition. We see it in many
other places. Handwriting recognition from images or sequences of pen strokes
is one example. Action labelling in videos is another.

Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a way to get around not
knowing the alignment between the input and the output. As we’ll see, it’s
especially well suited to applications like speech and handwriting
recognition.

---

To be a bit more formal, let’s consider mapping input sequences
X=[x1,x2,…,xT]X = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T]X=[x1​,x2​,…,xT​], such as audio, to corresponding output
sequences Y=[y1,y2,…,yU]Y = [y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_U]Y=[y1​,y2​,…,yU​], such as transcripts.
We want to find an accurate mapping from XXX’s to YYY’s.

There are challenges which get in the way of us
using simpler supervised learning algorithms. In particular:

Both XXX and YYY
 can vary in length.
The ratio of the lengths of XXX and YYY
 can vary.
We don’t have an accurate alignment (correspondence of the elements) of
 XXX and Y.Y.Y.

The CTC algorithm overcomes these challenges. For a given XXX
it gives us an output distribution over all possible YYY’s. We
can use this distribution either to *infer* a likely output or to assess
the *probability* of a given output.

Not all ways of computing the loss function and performing inference are
tractable. We’ll require that CTC do both of these efficiently.

**Loss Function:** For a given input, we’d like to train our
model to maximize the probability it assigns to the right answer. To do this,
we’ll need to efficiently compute the conditional probability
p(Y∣X).p(Y \mid X).p(Y∣X). The function p(Y∣X)p(Y \mid X)p(Y∣X) should
also be differentiable, so we can use gradient descent.

**Inference:** Naturally, after we’ve trained the model, we
want to use it to infer a likely YYY given an X.X.X.
This means solving

Y∗=argmaxYp(Y∣X).
{% raw %}
 Y^* \enspace =\enspace {\mathop{\text{argmax}}\limits_{Y}} \enspace p(Y \mid X).
{% endraw %}
Y∗=Yargmax​p(Y∣X).

Ideally Y∗Y^*Y∗ can be found efficiently. With CTC we’ll settle
for an approximate solution that’s not too expensive to find.

## The Algorithm

The CTC algorithm can assign a probability for any YYY
given an X.X.X. The key to computing this probability is how CTC
thinks about alignments between inputs and outputs. We’ll start by looking at
these alignments and then show how to use them to compute the loss function and
perform inference.

### Alignment

The CTC algorithm is *alignment-free* — it doesn’t require an
alignment between the input and the output. However, to get the probability of
an output given an input, CTC works by summing over the probability of all
possible alignments between the two. We need to understand what these
alignments are in order to understand how the loss function is ultimately
calculated.

To motivate the specific form of the CTC alignments, first consider a naive
approach. Let’s use an example. Assume the input has length six and Y=Y
=Y= [c, a, t]. One way to align XXX and YYY
is to assign an output character to each input step and collapse repeats.
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/naive_alignment.svg)


This approach has two problems.


 Often, it doesn’t make sense to force every input step to align to
 some output. In speech recognition, for example, the input can have stretches
 of silence with no corresponding output.
 

 We have no way to produce outputs with multiple characters in a row.
 Consider the alignment [h, h, e, l, l, l, o]. Collapsing repeats will
 produce “helo” instead of “hello”.
 

To get around these problems, CTC introduces a new token to the set of
allowed outputs. This new token is sometimes called the *blank* token. We’ll
refer to it here as ϵ.\epsilon.ϵ. The
ϵ\epsilonϵ token doesn’t correspond to anything and is simply
removed from the output.

The alignments allowed by CTC are the same length as the input. We allow any
alignment which maps to YYY after merging repeats and removing
ϵ\epsilonϵ tokens:
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/ctc_alignment_steps.svg)


If YYY has two of the same character in a row, then a valid
alignment must have an ϵ\epsilonϵ between them. With this rule
in place, we can differentiate between alignments which collapse to “hello” and
those which collapse to “helo”.

Let’s go back to the output [c, a, t] with an input of length six. Here are
a few more examples of valid and invalid alignments.
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/valid_invalid_alignments.svg)


The CTC alignments have a few notable properties. First, the allowed
alignments between XXX and YYY are monotonic.
If we advance to the next input, we can keep the corresponding output the
same or advance to the next one. A second property is that the alignment of
XXX to YYY is many-to-one. One or more input
elements can align to a single output element but not vice-versa. This implies
a third property: the length of YYY cannot be greater than the
length of X.X.X.

### Loss Function

The CTC alignments give us a natural way to go from probabilities at each
time-step to the probability of an output sequence.
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/full_collapse_from_audio.svg)


To be precise, the CTC objective
for a single (X,Y)(X, Y)(X,Y) pair is:



 The CTC conditional **probability**


**marginalizes** over the set of valid alignments
 

 computing the **probability** for a single alignment step-by-step.
 


Models trained with CTC typically use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to
estimate the per time-step probabilities, pt(at∣X).p_t(a_t \mid X).pt​(at​∣X).
An RNN usually works well since it accounts for context in the input, but we’re
free to use any learning algorithm which produces a distribution over output
classes given a fixed-size slice of the input.

If we aren’t careful, the CTC loss can be very expensive to compute. We
could try the straightforward approach and compute the score for each alignment
summing them all up as we go. The problem is there can be a massive number of
alignments.

 For a YYY of length UUU without any repeat
 characters and an XXX of length TTT the size
 of the set is (T+UT−U).{T + U \choose T - U}.(T−UT+U​). For T=100T=100T=100 and
 U=50U=50U=50 this number is almost 1040.10^{40}.1040.

For most problems this would be too slow.

Thankfully, we can compute the loss much faster with a dynamic programming
algorithm. The key insight is that if two alignments have reached the same
output at the same step, then we can merge them.

Since we can have an ϵ\epsilonϵ before or after any token in
YYY, it’s easier to describe the algorithm
using a sequence which includes them. We’ll work with the sequence
Z=[ϵ, y1, ϵ, y2, …, ϵ, yU, ϵ]
Z \enspace =\enspace [\epsilon, ~y_1, ~\epsilon, ~y_2,~ \ldots, ~\epsilon, ~y_U, ~\epsilon]
Z=[ϵ, y1​, ϵ, y2​, …, ϵ, yU​, ϵ]
which is YYY with an ϵ\epsilonϵ at
the beginning, end, and between every character.

Let’s let α\alphaα be the score of the merged alignments at a
given node. More precisely, αs,t\alpha_{s, t}αs,t​ is the CTC score of
the subsequence Z1:sZ_{1:s}Z1:s​ after ttt input steps.
As we’ll see, we’ll compute the final CTC score, P(Y∣X)P(Y \mid X)P(Y∣X),
from the α\alphaα’s at the last time-step. As long as we know
the values of α\alphaα at the previous time-step, we can compute
αs,t.\alpha_{s, t}.αs,t​. There are two cases.

**Case 1:**
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/cost_no_skip.svg)


In this case, we can’t jump over zs−1z_{s-1}zs−1​, the previous
token in Z.Z.Z. The first reason is that the previous token can
be an element of YYY, and we can’t skip elements of
Y.Y.Y. Since every element of YYY in
ZZZ is followed by an ϵ\epsilonϵ, we can
identify this when zs=ϵ. z_{s} = \epsilon.zs​=ϵ. The second reason is
that we must have an ϵ\epsilonϵ between repeat characters in
Y.Y.Y. We can identify this when
zs=zs−2.z_s = z_{s-2}.zs​=zs−2​.

To ensure we don’t skip zs−1z_{s-1}zs−1​, we can either be there
at the previous time-step or have already passed through at some earlier
time-step. As a result there are two positions we can transition from.
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/cost_regular.svg)


**Case 2:**

In the second case, we’re allowed to skip the previous token in
Z.Z.Z. We have this case whenever zs−1z_{s-1}zs−1​ is
an ϵ\epsilonϵ between unique characters. As a result there are
three positions we could have come from at the previous step.

Below is an example of the computation performed by the dynamic programming
algorithm. Every valid alignment has a path in this graph.

There are two valid starting nodes and two valid final nodes since the
ϵ\epsilonϵ at the beginning and end of the sequence is
optional. The complete probability is the sum of the two final nodes.

Now that we can efficiently compute the loss function, the next step is to
compute a gradient and train the model. The CTC loss function is differentiable
with respect to the per time-step output probabilities since it’s just sums and
products of them. Given this, we can analytically compute the gradient of the
loss function with respect to the (unnormalized) output probabilities and from
there run backpropagation as usual.

For a training set D\mathcal{D}D, the model’s parameters
are tuned to minimize the negative log-likelihood
∑(X,Y)∈D−logp(Y∣X)
{% raw %}
\sum_{(X, Y) \in \mathcal{D}} -\log\; p(Y \mid X)
{% endraw %}
(X,Y)∈D∑​−logp(Y∣X)
instead of maximizing the likelihood directly.

### Inference

After we’ve trained the model, we’d like to use it to find a likely output
for a given input. More precisely, we need to solve:

One heuristic is to take the most likely output at each time-step. This
gives us the alignment with the highest probability:

We can then collapse repeats and remove ϵ\epsilonϵ tokens to
get Y.Y.Y.

For many applications this heuristic works well, especially when most of the
probability mass is alloted to a single alignment. However, this approach can
sometimes miss easy to find outputs with much higher probability. The problem
is, it doesn’t take into account the fact that a single output can have many
alignments.

Here’s an example. Assume the alignments [a, a, ϵ\epsilonϵ]
and [a, a, a] individually have lower probability than [b, b, b]. But
the sum of their probabilities is actually greater than that of [b, b, b]. The
naive heuristic will incorrectly propose Y=Y =Y= [b] as
the most likely hypothesis. It should have chosen Y=Y =Y= [a].
To fix this, the algorithm needs to account for the fact that [a, a, a] and [a,
a, ϵ\epsilonϵ] collapse to the same output.

We can use a modified beam search to solve this. Given limited
computation, the modified beam search won’t necessarily find the
most likely Y.Y.Y. It does, at least, have
the nice property that we can trade-off more computation
(a larger beam-size) for an asymptotically better solution.

A regular beam search computes a new set of hypotheses at each input step.
The new set of hypotheses is generated from the previous set by extending each
hypothesis with all possible output characters and keeping only the top
candidates.
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/beam_search.svg)


We can modify the vanilla beam search to handle multiple alignments mapping to
the same output. In this case instead of keeping a list of alignments in the
beam, we store the output prefixes after collapsing repeats and removing
ϵ\epsilonϵ characters. At each step of the search we accumulate
scores for a given prefix based on all the alignments which map to it.

A proposed extension can map to two output prefixes if the character is a
repeat. This is shown at T=3T=3T=3 in the figure above
where ‘a’ is proposed as an extension to the prefix [a]. Both [a] and [a, a] are
valid outputs for this proposed extension.

When we extend [a] to produce [a,a], we only want include the part of the
previous score for alignments which end in ϵ.\epsilon.ϵ. Remember, the
ϵ\epsilonϵ is required between repeat characters. Similarly,
when we don’t extend the prefix and produce [a], we should only include the part
of the previous score for alignments which don’t end in ϵ.\epsilon.ϵ.

Given this, we have to keep track of two probabilities for each prefix
in the beam. The probability of all alignments which end in
ϵ\epsilonϵ and the probability of all alignments which don’t
end in ϵ.\epsilon.ϵ. When we rank the hypotheses at
each step before pruning the beam, we’ll use their combined scores.

The implementation of this algorithm doesn’t require much code, but it is
dense and tricky to get right. Checkout this
gist
for an example implementation in Python.

In some problems, such as speech recognition, incorporating a language model
over the outputs significantly improves accuracy. We can include the language
model as a factor in the inference problem.

The function L(Y)L(Y)L(Y) computes the length of
YYY in terms of the language model tokens and acts as a word
insertion bonus. With a word-based language model L(Y)L(Y)L(Y)
counts the number of words in Y.Y.Y. If we use a character-based
language model then L(Y)L(Y)L(Y) counts the number of characters
in Y.Y.Y. The language model scores are only included when a
prefix is extended by a character (or word) and not at every step of the
algorithm. This causes the search to favor shorter prefixes, as measured by
L(Y)L(Y)L(Y), since they don’t include as many language model
updates. The word insertion bonus helps with this. The parameters
α\alphaα and β\betaβ are usually set by
cross-validation.

The language model scores and word insertion term can be included in the
beam search. Whenever we propose to extend a prefix by a character, we can
include the language model score for the new character given the prefix so
far.

## Properties of CTC

We mentioned a few important properties of CTC so far. Here we’ll go
into more depth on what these properties are and what trade-offs they offer.

### Conditional Independence

One of the most commonly cited shortcomings of CTC is the conditional
independence assumption it makes.

![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/conditional_independence.svg)


The model assumes that every output is conditionally independent of
the other outputs given the input. This is a bad assumption for many
sequence to sequence problems.

Say we had an audio clip of someone saying “triple A”.
 Another valid transcription could
be “AAA”. If the first letter of the predicted transcription is ‘A’, then
the next letter should be ‘A’ with high probability and ‘r’ with low
probability. The conditional independence assumption does not allow for this.

In fact speech recognizers using CTC don’t learn a language model over the
output nearly as well as models which are conditionally dependent.
 However, a separate language model can
be included and usually gives a good boost to accuracy.

The conditional independence assumption made by CTC isn’t always a bad
thing. Baking in strong beliefs over output interactions makes the model less
adaptable to new or altered domains. For example, we might want to use a speech
recognizer trained on phone conversations between friends to transcribe
customer support calls. The language in the two domains can be quite different
even if the acoustic model is similar. With a CTC acoustic model, we can easily
swap in a new language model as we change domains.

### Alignment Properties

The CTC algorithm is *alignment-free*. The objective function
marginalizes over all alignments. While CTC does make strong assumptions about
the form of alignments between XXX and YYY, the
model is agnostic as to how probability is distributed amongst them. In some
problems CTC ends up allocating most of the probability to a single alignment.
However, this isn’t guaranteed.

We could force the model to choose a single
alignment by replacing the sum with a max in the objective function,
p(Y∣X)=maxA∈AX,Y∏t=1Tp(at∣X).
{% raw %}
p(Y \mid X) \enspace = \enspace \max_{A \in \mathcal{A}_{X,Y}} \enspace \prod_{t=1}^T \; p(a_t \mid X).
{% endraw %}
p(Y∣X)=A∈AX,Y​max​t=1∏T​p(at​∣X).

As mentioned before, CTC only allows *monotonic* alignments. In
problems such as speech recognition this may be a valid assumption. For other
problems like machine translation where a future word in a target sentence
can align to an earlier part of the source sentence, this assumption is a
deal-breaker.

Another important property of CTC alignments is that they are
*many-to-one*. Multiple inputs can align to at most one output. In some
cases this may not be desirable. We might want to enforce a strict one-to-one
correspondence between elements of XXX and
Y.Y.Y. Alternatively, we may want to allow multiple output
elements to align to a single input element. For example, the characters
“th” might align to a single input step of audio. A character based CTC model
would not allow that.

The many-to-one property implies that the output can’t have more time-steps
than the input.

 If YYY has rrr consecutive
 repeats, then the length of YYY must be less than
 the length of XXX by 2r−1.2r - 1.2r−1.

This is usually not a problem for speech and handwriting recognition since the
input is much longer than the output. However, for other problems where
YYY is often longer than XXX, CTC just won’t
work.

## CTC in Context

In this section we’ll discuss how CTC relates to other commonly used
algorithms for sequence modeling.

### HMMs

At a first glance, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) seems quite different from
CTC. But, the two algorithms are actually quite similar. Understanding the
relationship between them will help us understand what advantages CTC has over
HMM sequence models and give us insight into how CTC could be changed for
various use cases.

Let’s use the same notation as before,
XXX is the input sequence and YYY
is the output sequence with lengths TTT and
UUU respectively. We’re interested in learning
p(Y∣X).p(Y \mid X).p(Y∣X). One way to simplify the problem is to apply
Bayes’ Rule:
p(Y \mid X) \; \propto \; p(X \mid Y) \; p(Y).
p(Y∣X)∝p(X∣Y)p(Y).

The p(Y)p(Y)p(Y) term can be any language model, so let’s focus on
p(X∣Y).p(X \mid Y).p(X∣Y). Like before we’ll let
A\mathcal{A}A be a set of allowed alignments between
XXX and Y.Y.Y. Members of
A\mathcal{A}A have length T.T.T.
Let’s otherwise leave A\mathcal{A}A unspecified for now. We’ll
come back to it later. We can marginalize over alignments to get
p(X∣Y)=∑A∈Ap(X,A∣Y).
{% raw %}
p(X \mid Y)\; = \; \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \; p(X, A \mid Y).
{% endraw %}
p(X∣Y)=A∈A∑​p(X,A∣Y).
To simplify notation, let’s remove the conditioning on YYY, it
will be present in every p(⋅).p(\cdot).p(⋅). With two assumptions we can
write down the standard HMM.

The first assumption is the usual Markov property. The state
ata_tat​ is conditionally independent of all historic states given
the previous state at−1.a_{t-1}.at−1​. The second is that the observation
xtx_txt​ is conditionally independent of everything given the
current state at.a_t.at​.
![](https://distill.pub/2017/assets/hmm.svg)


Now we can take just a few steps to transform the HMM into CTC and see how
the two models relate. First, let’s assume that the transition probabilities
p(at∣at−1)p(a_t \mid a_{t-1})p(at​∣at−1​) are uniform. This gives
p(X)∝∑A∈A∏t=1Tp(xt∣at).
{% raw %}
p(X) \enspace \propto \enspace \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \enspace \prod_{t=1}^T \; p(x_t \mid a_t).
{% endraw %}
p(X)∝A∈A∑​t=1∏T​p(xt​∣at​).
There are only two differences from this equation and the CTC loss function.
The first is that we are learning a model of XXX given
YYY as opposed to YYY given X.X.X.
The second is how the set A\mathcal{A}A is produced. Let’s deal
with each in turn.

The HMM can be used with discriminative models which estimate p(a∣x).p(a \mid x).p(a∣x).
To do this, we apply Bayes’ rule and rewrite the model as
p(X)∝∑A∈A∏t=1Tp(at∣xt)p(xt)p(at)
{% raw %}
p(X) \enspace \propto \enspace \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \enspace \prod_{t=1}^T \; \frac{p(a_t \mid x_t)\; p(x_t)}{p(a_t)}
{% endraw %}
p(X)∝A∈A∑​t=1∏T​p(at​)p(at​∣xt​)p(xt​)​
∝∑A∈A∏t=1Tp(at∣xt)p(at). 
{% raw %}
\quad\quad\quad\propto \enspace \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \enspace \prod_{t=1}^T \; \frac{p(a_t \mid x_t)}{p(a_t)}.
{% endraw %}
∝A∈A∑​t=1∏T​p(at​)p(at​∣xt​)​.


If we assume a uniform prior over the states aaa and condition on all of
XXX instead of a single element at a time, we arrive at
p(X)∝∑A∈A∏t=1Tp(at∣X).
{% raw %}
p(X) \enspace \propto \enspace \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \enspace \prod_{t=1}^T \; p(a_t \mid X).
{% endraw %}
p(X)∝A∈A∑​t=1∏T​p(at​∣X).

The above equation is essentially the CTC loss function, assuming the set
A\mathcal{A}A is the same. In fact, the HMM framework does not specify what
A\mathcal{A}A should consist of. This part of the model can be designed on a
per-problem basis. In many cases the model doesn’t condition on YYY and the
set A\mathcal{A}A consists of all possible length TTT sequences from the
output alphabet. In this case, the HMM can be drawn as an *ergodic* state
transition diagram in which every state connects to every other state. The
figure below shows this model with the alphabet or set of unique hidden states
as {a,b,c}.\{a, b, c\}.{a,b,c}.

In our case the transitions allowed by the model are strongly related to
Y.Y.Y. We want the HMM to reflect this. One possible model could
be a simple linear state transition diagram. The figure below shows this with
the same alphabet as before and Y=Y =Y= [a, b]. Another commonly
used model is the *Bakis* or left-right HMM. In this model any
transition which proceeds from the left to the right is allowed.

In CTC we augment the alphabet with ϵ\epsilonϵ and the HMM model allows a
subset of the left-right transitions. The CTC HMM has two start
states and two accepting states.

One possible source of confusion is that the HMM model differs for any unique
Y.Y.Y. This is in fact standard in applications such as speech recognition. The
state diagram changes based on the output Y.Y.Y. However, the functions which
estimate the observation and transition probabilities are shared.

Let’s discuss how CTC improves on the original HMM model. First, we can think
of the CTC state diagram as a special case HMM which works well for many
problems of interest. Incorporating the blank as a hidden state in the HMM
allows us to use the alphabet of YYY as the other hidden states. This model
also gives a set of allowed alignments which may be a good prior for some
problems.

Perhaps most importantly, CTC is discriminative. It models p(Y∣X)p(Y \mid
 X)p(Y∣X) directly, an idea that’s been important in the past with other
discriminative improvements to HMMs.
Discriminative training let’s us apply powerful learning algorithms like the
RNN directly towards solving the problem we care about.

### Encoder-Decoder Models

The encoder-decoder is perhaps the most commonly used framework for sequence
modeling with neural networks. These models have an encoder
and a decoder. The encoder maps the input sequence XXX into a
hidden representation. The decoder consumes the hidden representation and
produces a distribution over the outputs. We can write this as

H=encode(X)p(Y∣X)=decode(H).
\begin{aligned}
H\enspace &= \enspace\textsf{encode}(X) \\[.5em]
p(Y \mid X)\enspace &= \enspace \textsf{decode}(H).
\end{aligned}
Hp(Y∣X)​=encode(X)=decode(H).​

The encode(⋅)\textsf{encode}(\cdot)encode(⋅) and
decode(⋅)\textsf{decode}(\cdot)decode(⋅) functions are typically RNNs. The
decoder can optionally be equipped with an attention mechanism. The hidden
state sequence HHH has the same number of time-steps as the
input, T.T.T. Sometimes the encoder subsamples the input. If the
encoder subsamples the input by a factor sss then
HHH will have T/sT/sT/s time-steps.

We can interpret CTC in the encoder-decoder framework. This is helpful to
understand the developments in encoder-decoder models that are applicable to
CTC and to develop a common language for the properties of these
models.

**Encoder:** The encoder of a CTC model can be just about any
encoder we find in commonly used encoder-decoder models. For example the
encoder could be a multi-layer bidirectional RNN or a convolutional network.
There is a constraint on the CTC encoder that doesn’t apply to the others. The
input length cannot be sub-sampled so much that T/sT/sT/s
is less than the length of the output.

**Decoder:** We can view the decoder of a CTC model as a simple
linear transformation followed by a softmax normalization. This layer should
project all TTT steps of the encoder output
HHH into the dimensionality of the output alphabet.

We mentioned earlier that CTC makes a conditional independence assumption over
the characters in the output sequence. This is one of the big advantages that
other encoder-decoder models have over CTC — they can model the
dependence over the outputs. However in practice, CTC is still more commonly
used in tasks like speech recognition as we can partially overcome the
conditional independence assumption by including an external language model.

## Practitioner’s Guide

So far we’ve mostly developed a conceptual understanding of CTC. Here we’ll go
through a few implementation tips for practitioners.

**Software:** Even with a solid understanding of CTC, the
implementation is difficult. The algorithm has several edge cases and a fast
implementation should be written in a lower-level programming language.
Open-source software tools make it much easier to get started:

Baidu Research has open-sourced
 warp-ctc. The
 package is written in C++ and CUDA. The CTC loss function runs on either
 the CPU or the GPU. Bindings are available for Torch, TensorFlow and
 PyTorch.
 
TensorFlow has built in
 CTC loss
 and CTC beam search
 functions for the CPU.
 
Nvidia also provides a GPU implementation of CTC in
 cuDNN versions 7 and up.
 

**Numerical Stability:** Computing the CTC loss naively is
numerically unstable. One method to avoid this is to normalize the
α\alphaα’s at each time-step. The original publication
has more detail on this including the adjustments to the gradient.
 In practice this works well enough
for medium length sequences but can still underflow for long sequences.
A better solution is to compute the loss function in log-space with the
log-sum-exp trick.

When computing the sum of two probabilities in log space use the identity
\log(e^a + e^b) = \max\{a, b\} + \log(1 + e^{-|a-b|})
log(ea+eb)=max{a,b}+log(1+e−∣a−b∣)
Most programming languages have a stable function to compute
log(1+x)\log(1 + x)log(1+x) when
xxx is close to zero.


Inference should also be done in log-space using the log-sum-exp trick.

**Beam Search:** There are a couple of good tips to know about
when implementing and using the CTC beam search.

The correctness of the beam search can be tested as follows.


 Run the beam search algorithm on an arbitrary input.
 

 Save the inferred output Y¯\bar{Y}Y¯ and the corresponding
 score c¯.\bar{c}.c¯.


 Compute the actual CTC score ccc for
 Y¯.\bar{Y}.Y¯.


 Check that c¯≈c\bar{c} \approx cc¯≈c with the former being no
 greater than the later. As the beam size increases the inferred output
 Y¯\bar{Y}Y¯ may change, but the two numbers should grow
 closer.
 

A common question when using a beam search decoder is the size of the beam
to use. There is a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. We can check if the
beam size is in a good range. To do this first compute the CTC score for the
inferred output ci.c_i.ci​. Then compute the CTC score for the ground
truth output cg.c_g.cg​. If the two outputs are not the same, we
should have cg<ci.c_g \lt c_i.cg​<ci​. If ci<<cgc_i << c_gci​<<cg​ then
the ground truth output actually has a higher probability under the model and
the beam search failed to find it. In this case a large increase to the beam
size may be warranted.
