My blog post about fonts generated lots of traffic – it landed on Hacker News, took down my site while I was sleeping, and then obviously vanished from HN before I woke up. But it also got retweeted by a ton of people.

This clearly constitutes another proof of how effective animated gifs are. There’s some stuff out there on the internet that I think is about 10x cooler than my blog post:

[Recurrent Net Dreams Up Fake Chinese Characters in Vector Format with TensorFlow](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/28/recurrent-net-dreams-up-fake-chinese-characters-in-vector-format-with-tensorflow) – blog post from a few weeks ago, doing something similar but modeling the strokes of Chinese characters as vector paths.

[Learning a Manifold of Fonts](http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/Projects/projects_fonts/projects_fonts.html) – something I found the other day

[Recurrent neural network handwriting generation demo](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/handwriting.html) – very cool RNN approach, similar to the Chinese character experiment above.

Some more [Chinese characters generated using a neural network](http://www.genekogan.com/works/a-book-from-the-sky.html) – in this case it’s a DCGAN (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) which is probably a better architecture than what I was using.

[Avería](http://iotic.com/averia) – several people sent me this link about generating an “average” font
