I love college basketball. A lot. My beloved Marquette Golden Eagles Warriors are probably the only sports team that can really put me in agony.

Last season, I was watching a [nail-biter against Notre Dame](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330730269). With 3:36 left, Notre Dame's Jack Cooley grabbed an offensive board and promptly passed out to Pat Connaughton for a successful three-pointer. It was a dagger.

One thing stuck out to me though - after the shot, [Jay Bilas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Bilas), who was calling the game with [Bill Raftery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Raftery) and [Sean McDonough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McDonough), stated that the best time to attempt a 3-pointer is after an offensive rebound.

Intuitively, this statement makes sense - the defensive front line is crashing the boards in hopes of getting a rebound to end the offensive possession, while the defensive backcourt is out on the wings looking for an outlet pass from their teammates, likely leaving their offensive counterparts unguarded.

I've never seen any data that indicates whether three pointers are more successful after an offensive rebound though, much less whether it's the best time to shoot one. It seemed like something worth investigating.

In the following analysis, we'll try to determine whether there is a material difference between "normal" 3P% (those not shot after an offensive rebound) and 3P% when the shot was preceded by an offensive rebound.

I'll be going step by step through data collection, munging, and analysis. If you're just interested in the answer, skip to the last section.
