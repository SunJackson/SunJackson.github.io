Back in 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation [released a report](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview) on the (normalized) number of traffic deaths in each U.S. state. As I looked through the list, I noticed an odd correlation between the [political leanings of a state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states) and its traffic fatalities.

To confirm this notion, I used box plots to show the distribution of traffic deaths based on how Republican-leaning each state is, where each dot represents a state.

In case you’re wondering, Delaware is the Democratic outlier with 1.26 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Outliers aside, we see an abundantly clear trend: **Republican-leaning states tend to have more traffic deaths**.

To provide another view, I plotted the same data set as a scatter plot and fit a linear regression below. Each dot represents a state. Again, we see a strong relationship between Republican-leaning states and more traffic deaths.

At this point, I feel obligated to make the caveat that these charts only establish a correlation, and it doesn’t mean that residents of Republican-leaning states experience higher traffic deaths because they tend to vote Republican. However, it sure makes for an interesting statistic to ponder: why would there be a correlation between traffic death rate and tendency to vote Republican?
