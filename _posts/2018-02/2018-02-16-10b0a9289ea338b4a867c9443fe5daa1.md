Like the last several updates, this blog post will be fairly short, given only a single bug fix was added.

Thanks again to GitHub user leocwlau who reported that the `GetReportSuiteGroups` function added an additional field AND provided the solution. No other bug fixes were made, nor was any additional functionality added.

Version 1.4.14 of RSiteCatalyst was submitted to CRAN today and should be available for download in the coming days.

As I’ve mentioned in many a blog post before this one, I encourage all users of the software to continue reporting bugs via GitHub issues, and especially if you can provide a working code example. Even better, a fix via pull request will ensure that your bug will be addressed in a timely manner and for the benefit to others in the community.

*Note: Please don’t email directly via the email in the RSiteCatalyst package, it will not be returned. Having a valid email contact in the package is a requirement to have a package listed on CRAN so they can contact the package author, it is not meant to imply I can/will provide endless, personalized support for free.*
