Hey all, if you enjoyed posts like [this](http://www.willmcginnis.com/2015/10/31/data-science-vs-data-engineering) or [this](http://www.willmcginnis.com/2018/01/09/tendencies-data-engineers-scientists), you might also enjoy a podcast I did a couple of weeks back with Tobias Macey at the Data Engineering Podcast. We chatted for a bit about the roles and responsibilities of data engineers vs. data scientists, how we see the industry changing, and how to try to manage the two roles effectively.

If that doesn't quite do it for you, there are also some other really good interviews on there with a more technical or product slant.
