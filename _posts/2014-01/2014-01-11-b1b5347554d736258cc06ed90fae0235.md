At the AAS meeting this week, David Hogg of NYU joked that I'm taking the package with the worst
interface (matplotlib), the package with the steepest learning curve (d3),
and finally doing the world the service of combining them.
I've run into several other people who are also incredulous about this whole project.
Why force-fit browser compatibility into an old tool like matplotlib, rather than simply
switching to a newer tool,
something like [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) or [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/)
or [glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) or [vispy](http://vispy.org/)
or [d3po](http://d3po.org/) or [d3py](https://github.com/mikedewar/d3py)
or any of the other approaches that are being developed with this sort of
interactivity included from the ground up?

For me, the answer is two-fold. First of all, matplotlib is extremely well-established
in the Scientific Python community, and even if its successor were clear, there are still
a lot of people who know the package well and use it regularly. Working within the matplotlib
interface will give many, many people a very easy path toward making modern, interactive,
web-embeddable visualizations.

Secondly, even as people move away from matplotlib's interface, there are many newer packages which
depend on matplotlib as a core renderer. The creators of projects like
[prettyplotlib](https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib),
[seaborn](http://www.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn),
[ggplot-py](https://github.com/yhat/ggplot), and others have recognized the incredible investment that's been made in matplotlib:
its variety of backends support nearly any imaginable computing system and file format;
its flexible (if sometimes obscure) API has everything that's needed in a good medium-data visualization tool;
and over a decade of active development in the presence of a wide-ranging user-base have resulted
in an incredibly robust package. For all these reasons, matplotlib provides what is perhaps
the ideal foundation on which to build new, more modern and streamlined data visualization
interfaces, as the three packages mentioned above have begun doing. With this in mind, a
distinct advantage of the mpld3 approach is that, once it is feature-complete, it will
*automatically* provide d3 support to these new library interfaces as well.

People have also asked me whether what I'm doing here isn't duplicative of the WebAgg
backend
that the matplotlib developers have put together. An initial version has been released,
and there are plans
to create a seamless interface between this and the IPython notebook, resulting in an
interactive notebook experience with plots *tied to the Python kernel*. This is extremely
exciting, but it has a distinct disadvantage: because of WebAgg's dependence on the
Python kernel, the results cannot be simply embedded in web pages like the plots you've seen
here. This is a niche that mpld3 will fill even as matplotlib's WebAgg support becomes more mature.

So, although alternatives do exist, and matplotlib does have some distinct weaknesses,
I think work on mpld3 is a worthy investment that will continue to enable good work
well into the future.
