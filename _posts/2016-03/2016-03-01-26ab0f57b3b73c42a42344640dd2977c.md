I’m excited to announce that the University of Sheffield’s Department of Computer Science will make two appointments in machine learning this year.

These appointments support our recently launched MSc in Data Analytics (being delivered in combination with the University’s iSchool and the School of Mathematics and Statistics).

They will also support the work we are doing in Open Data Science, another collaboration with the School of Mathematics and Statistics.

The announcement of the posts is another indication of the Department and University’s commitment to the area of data.

For further details see the department’s page here.

Relevant description from the adverts:

Machine learning is one of the principal technologies underpinning the current revolution in data science, and the key technology for recent advances in artificial intelligence. The Sheffield Machine Learning group is at the heart of both applications in artificial intelligence and data science.

Our interactions in artificial intelligence are through the Department’s Natural Language Processing group, its Speech and Hearing group, as well as Sheffield Robotics, a cross-faculty centre of excellence in robotics.

Our activities in data science are primarily a collaboration with the School of Mathematics and Statistics through the Open Data Science Initiative (ODSI), a cross-faculty initiative targeted at developing new machine learning and statistical methodologies and making techniques available as widely as possible. The ODSI also runs summer schools, supports the development of new taught programs in data and delivers scientific software support to facilitate the teaching of data science.

Further opportunities for collaboration are available at a range of other data-driven centres throughout the University including the Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected Healthcare (a collaboration with the School of Health and Related Research) and the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, a centre of excellence in translational healthcare with a focus on neurodegenerative disease. The machine learning group also collaborates with the Sheffield Methods Institute, a centre of excellence in social science methodology, the Sheffield Institute for International Development, the Sheffield Bioinformatics Hub and Insigneo, the institute for in silico medicine.

We welcome applications from scholars with an international track record in the development of new machine learning methodologies both in theory and practice. Successful candidates will also be expected to play an active role in the development and delivery of our new MSc course in Data Analytics.
