We launched [Sense](https://sense.io/.) with the mission of helping data scientists and data engineers focus on what’s important — extracting value from data rather than managing infrastructure. As the quantity of data explodes and machine learning pushes computing to new limits, this mission has only become more important.

**Today, we’re excited to take another big step toward making this vision a reality: Sense is joining [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/.)!**

We couldn’t imagine a better fit for Sense and our customers. [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/.) is the clear leader when it comes to modern data management and analytics. They share our vision for a world where data helps solve the world’s biggest problems. By joining Cloudera, we believe we can accelerate this task.

As always, our customers are our top priority. We plan to continue working with our customers to make Sense the most powerful and productive platform for data scientists and data engineers. We can’t wait to see what’s possible together.

Onwards!
