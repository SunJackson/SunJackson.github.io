WASHINGTON, Dec. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Today SourcingLine published the first edition of their research on Top [Marketing Analytics Consultants](https://www.sourcingline.com/research/marketing-analytics-consultants). The research leverages the proprietary Leaders Matrix methodology that maps each firm's focus on Marketing Analytics against their ability to deliver world-class results for their clients. SourcingLine also published a companion directory of [BI & Big Data Analytics Consultants](https://www.sourcingline.com/directory/bi-data-analytics-consultants), which provides prospective buyers with filtering tools to help identify service providers that best meet their needs.

The Leaders Matrix focuses on firms that are able to improve data centric business processes and develop custom solutions for enterprise clients. The top consultants were selected based on over a dozen factors including company experience, breadth of knowledge, client references, certifications, industry recognition, and marketing presence. 

Out of the hundreds of firms that work in this field, only fourteen were highlighted in the research. The firms are: Anthem Marketing Solutions, Statistics Solutions, CBIG Consulting, Beyond the Arc, Dataself,  LatentView Analytics, Denologix, Qualex Consulting Services, Datalab USA, Datascope Analytics, Business Data Miners, DM Stat-1 Consulting, Crystalloids, and Datamum.

"For an enterprise to realize all the benefits of its structured and unstructured data, they need a partner that truly understands data's value while understanding the company's unique marketing processes and customer base," stated Tim Clarke, Senior Business Analyst at SourcingLine. "Whether you need data modeling or consulting, the firms identified in our Leaders Matrix can help their clients rapidly meet their marketing objectives."

SourcingLine's effort to identify the top BI and big data analytics consultants will be ongoing and they encourage firms with a proven record to apply to participate in updates to the research. Other SourcingLine research focuses on leading consultants covering operations and process improvement, compliance, fraud and risk management, IT security and crime prevention and a number of other industry verticals.
