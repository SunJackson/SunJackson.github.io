I recently analyzed a somewhat puzzling data set. I was sending HTTP POST requests to a system. The system's would then acknowledge receipt of these requests (returning a 200 status code), and some time later (it was a slow asynchronous process) send a web hook to a specified URL *if the request was successful*. However, successful was far from certain; most requests actually failed. My job was to measure the success rate.

Concretely, event `A` would trigger at some time `t0`. If `A` was successful, then event `B` might occur at time `t1`. `B` can only occur if `A` occurred.

Similar systems like this happen in a variety of contexts:

- Ad delivery. The ad must first be displayed (event `A`), and only after it's displayed can the viewer click a link (event `B`).

- Email. The email must first be opened (event `A`), and only after it's opened can the reader click a link (event `B`).

- Web forms. A user must first enter their credit card, and only after that can they click submit.


What I wanted to compute was `alpha = P(A)` and `beta = P(B | A)`.

When analyzing the data I had, I noticed a curious pattern.

That last row (for request ID `jkl`) indicates something really weird happening. It suggests that event `B` has occurred even though event `A` has not!

According to my model, which I have a high degree of confidence in, this isn't possible. Yet it's in the data; the responding system could not post a web hook with ID `jkl` if they hadn't received the request; they couldn't possibly know this ID.

The conclusion I drew is that our measurements of `A` and `B` are unreliable. `A` and `B` may actually occur without being observed. So the real problem at hand is to infer the true rates at which `A` and `B` occur from the complete data set.

## Some simplified calculations

I'll begin with some simple calculations - using nothing but arithmetic - to give the flavor of this analysis. To make things concrete, suppose we have the following data set:

Suppose we have the following counts:

- 100k requests were made

- In 40k cases, event `A` was reported and `B` did was not reported

- In 10k cases, event `A` was reported and then `B` was reported

- In 5k cases, event `B` was reported but `A` was never reported


The most naive possible approach is to simply treat the cases where `B` occurred to be *bad data* and discard them. Then we can estimate:

But we can do better than this. We can use logical inference to deduce that in every case where `B` occurred, `A` also occurred. So we actually know that `A` occurred 55k times, and `A` then `B` occurred 15k times. So we can then estimate:

Finally, there's a third approach we can take. Lets define the parameters `gamma_A = P(A reported | A occurred)` and `gamma_B = P(B reported | B occurred)`. Lets assume that `gamma_A = gamma_B = gamma`; this is reasonable in the event that events `A` and `B` are measured by the same mechanism (e.g., a tracking pixel).

Then we can infer, based on the fact that `B` occurred at least 500 times without `A` being reported, that approximately 10% (5k A occurrences without reports/ 50k A reports) of the time, data is lost. This suggests `gamma ~= 0.9`.

We can then estimate that there were 50k / 0.9 = 55.56k occurrences of `A` and 15k / 0.9 = 16.67k occurrences of `B`, yielding:

### Small errors result in big differences!

Based on the data we have, we've guesstimated that approximately 10% of the events which occur are not reported. However, this effect cascades and results in an overall success rate of `alpha * beta` being reported as 10.5% (= 1,000 / 9,500) rather than 16.7% (= 1667 / 10,000). That's a huge difference!

## Statistical method

These calculations are all great, but we also need to deal with uncertainty. It's possible that actually `gamma=0.95` but we simply got unlucky, or `gamma=0.85` and we got very lucky. How can we quantify this?

This can be done relatively straightforwardly with [pymc3](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/getting_started.html).

The results can then be plotted:

As is expected, we have sharp lower bounds; the true number of events could not be lower than our observed number of events.

These numbers are in rough accordance with our heuristic calculations above.

## Extracting fundamental parameters

In the above data, we've done two important things.

*First*, we've built a [nowcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowcasting_(economics)) of our underlying data. That is to say, while the number of times events `A` and `B` occur is nominally directly observable (albeit noisily), the actual number of times are not. So we can construct better estimates (as well as credible intervals) of the event occurrent counts.

*Second*, we've built a direct probabilistic way of computing the fundamental parameters of the problem, namely `alpha` and `beta`. In our pymc code, just as we can plot a histogram of `a_occurrences` (via `pl.hist(trace['a_occurred'][::20], bins=50)`), we can similarly plot a histogram of `alpha` itself. In many instances - e.g. [A/B testing](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/310840/VWO_SmartStats_technical_whitepaper.pdf) or [bandit algorithms](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/bayesian_bandit.html) - the underlying probabilities are the parameter of direct interest. The actual counts are only incidental.

The conclusion here is that missing data is not a fundamentally limiting factor in running many analysis. Provided you have a more complete generative model of data collection, and adequate data to fit the model, you can actually correct for missing data when running such analysis.
