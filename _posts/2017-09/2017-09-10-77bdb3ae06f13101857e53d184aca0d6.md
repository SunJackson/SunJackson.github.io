At least in my town. Sometime back I kind of decided to use Quantopian as the backtesting platform of my choice. QuantConnect was a close second best. Now, a few months later, Quantopian has decided to end the live trading. No choice, but to go back to the second choice.QuantConnet has several advantages, it was a pretty close decision even when there was a choice. Now, there is little choice – makes things easier.

For trading, my preference is definitely for a managed language (read C# or Java). Using C# and Visual Studio on daily basis at work (I work at Microsoft, **hence a disclaimer: my opinions about Microsoft’s products may be biased**), it seems like a perfect choice. For those of us who feel C# is behind Python and R for data science and time series analysis, well the Python support on QuantConnect seems to be getting better and more advanced by the day. That’s right, although the core engine is C#, QuantConnect supports Python and F# as well.

So we are good, at least for now.
