*Thanks to this [post of facial landmarks](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python) and the [openface project](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface)!*

*11/11  updated the image pool to 710000*

*11/3  updated the image pool to 540000*

*10/14 add face similarity searching! from a 4000-photo pool*

*Deep Learning model find 128 features of each face –Then Cosine distance ~ simple but powerful. *

*** face similarity searching from celebrities (which superstar looks like you the most)?***

 

I’ve implemented the idea to a web app that can batch processing face chopping from pics  & facial landmarks pinpointing!

The next step will be training beauty score rating model & a face similarity comparing to superstars (which star looks like you the most)?
