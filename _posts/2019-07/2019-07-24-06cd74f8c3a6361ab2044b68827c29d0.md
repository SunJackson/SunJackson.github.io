Approximately 136 new packages stuck to CRAN in June. (This number is difficult to nail down with certainty because packages may be removed from CRAN after sitting there for a few days.) Here are my picks for the June “Top 40” in ten categories: Computational Methods, Data, Finance, Genomics, Machine Learning, Science and Medicine, Statistics, Time Series, Utilities, and Visualization.

### Computational Methods

cppRouting v1.1: Provides functions to calculate distances, shortest paths and isochrones on weighted graphs using several variants of Dijkstra algorithm. Algorithms include unidirectional Dijkstra Dijkstra (1959), bidirectional Dijkstra Goldberg et al. (2005), A* search Hart et al. (1968), and new bidirectional A* Pijls & Post (2009). See the vignette and website for how to use the package.
