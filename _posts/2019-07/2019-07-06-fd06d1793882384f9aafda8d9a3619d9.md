In my previous post, I created the P2 Penrose tessellation according to the instructions of this post. Now it’s time to create the P3 tessellation following the same technique I described already. This is the image of the P3 tessellation:

Note that all tiles are rhombuses. I recognize that I like the P3 more than the P2, I do not really why. What about you? Here you have the code to play with it if you want.
