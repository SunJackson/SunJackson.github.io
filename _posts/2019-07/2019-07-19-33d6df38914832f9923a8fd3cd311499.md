I was recently asked how to go about matching several datasets where different samples ofindividuals were interviewed. This sounds like a big problem; say that you have dataset A and B,and that A contain one sample of individuals, and B another sample of individuals, then how couldyou possibly match the datasets? Matching datasets requires a common identifier, for instance,suppose that A contains socio-demographic information on a sample of individuals I, while B,contains information on wages and hours worked on the same sample of individuals I, then yes,it will be possible to match/merge/join both datasets.

But that was not what I was asked about; I was asked about a situation where the same populationgets sampled twice, and each sample answers to a different survey. For example the first surveyis about labour market information and survey B is about family structure. Would it be possible tocombine the information from both datasets?

To me, this sounded a bit like missing data imputation problem, but where all the informationabout the variables of interest was missing! I started digging a bit, and found that not only therewas already quite some literature on it, there is even a package for this, called `{StatMatch}` witha very detailed vignette.The vignette is so detailed, that I will not write any code, I just wanted to share this package!
