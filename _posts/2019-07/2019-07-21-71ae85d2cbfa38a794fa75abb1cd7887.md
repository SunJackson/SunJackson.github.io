A new release 0.3.2 of the RPushbullet package is now on CRAN. RPushbullet is interfacing the neat Pushbullet service for inter-device messaging, communication, and more. It lets you easily send alerts like the one to the left to your browser, phone, tablet, … – or all at once.

This is the first new release in almost 2 1/2 years, and it once again benefits greatly from contributed pull requests by Colin (twice !) and Chan-Yub – see below for details.

> 
Changes in version 0.3.2 (2019-07-21)


The Travis setup was robustified with respect to the token needed to run tests (Dirk in #48)


The configuration file is now readable only by the user (Colin Gillespie in #50)


At startup initialization is now more consistent (Colin Gillespie in #53 fixing #52)


A new function to fetch prior posts was added (Chanyub Park in #54). `




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for this release. More details about the package are at the RPushbullet webpage and the RPushbullet GitHub repo.
