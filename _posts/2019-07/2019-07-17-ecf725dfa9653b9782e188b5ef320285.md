*Before we begin, This is not a fight between 2D vs 3D plots — nor this is to claim that 3D Plots are superior to 2D, because it’s got one-extra dimension. In fact, I’m one of those who try to avoid adding too much to a plot that the plot loses its own plot. But there are instances when you know you can be better at storytelling by using 3D plots. This article is to help you in those instances!*

3D Plots built in the right way for the right purpose are always stunning. In this article, we’ll see how to make stunning 3D plots with R using `ggplot2` and `rayshader` . While `ggplot2` might be familiar to anyone in Data science, `rayshader` may not. So, let’s start with a small introduction to `rayshader`.

From the Package Description of `rayshader:`

> 
**rayshader** is an open source package for producing 2D and 3D data visualizations in R. **rayshader** uses elevation data in a base R matrix and a combination of raytracing, spherical texture mapping, overlays, and ambient occlusion to generate beautiful topographic 2D and 3D maps. In addition to maps, **rayshader** also allows the user to translate **ggplot2** objects into beautiful 3D data visualizations.


 

### Required Libraries/Packages:

 The latest version of `rayshader` is available on github which could be installed using either `devtools` or `remotes` .



And, make sure you’ve got the most recent version of `ggplot2` . If you are a tidyverse-person, then get the latest of it.



 

### **Data**

 To keep the requirements of this article minimal, We’ll use `faithfuld` one of the inbuilt datasets in `ggplot2` library.



As you can see, `faithfuld` has got 3 continuous variables which we’ll use for plotting.

 

### 2D Plot

 Our journey of a 3D plot just begins with a normal 2D ggplot2 plot. We’ll build a density plot using geom_raster between `waiting`, `eruptions` to see how how the data is.



As you can see in the above code, Along with the plot we’ve done a bit of aesthetic improvement to the way the plot looks like this

Well, that’s neat but this is one of those plots where I’d love to show it in 3D to show a small hill — in fact, two small hills. So, let’s propel towards a 3D plot.

 

### Journey from 2D Plot to 3D Plot — One Line!

 The journey from a 2D plot to a 3D Plot, is just one extra line of code that comes from the package `rayshader` . The function `plot_gg() `which takes a bunch of arguments to define how the 3D plot should look like.



`faithful_dd` is the ggplot2 object that we generated in the previous step. As most of the arguments are self-explanatory like —` multicore` to activate all the cores of the computer while rendering. Arguments like `zoom` and `phi`are to set where the 3D camera view should be.

Let’s take a look at the generated plots:

Doesn’t it look beautiful? These are not just stunning but also purposeful. Imagine, you get to explain Gradient descent or some optimization algorithm like this which is more intuitive and self-explanatory to get a mental model.

 

### One More Thing!

 This story doesn’t end with just a 3D Plot but the developer (Tyler Morgan-Wall) was kind enough to give us another function `render_movie()` that places a Camera and revolves it around the 3D plot that we just built and gives us a stunning video of the 3D Plot. `render_movie()` internally uses `av`package to make a video.





 

### Summary

 Thanks to Tyler, now we can make stunning 3D Plots from 2D ggplots — just using one extra function `plot_gg()` ultimately even making a 360-degree video of the 3D Plot.
