Hi R-Community!

You were so many and so enthusiast at our last MilanoR meeting, we really felt your support and our speakers did that too!

Hosted by Microsoft and Quantide, our sponsors, we explored two different fields, **Information retrieval** and **Strategic Price Positioning.**

For those of you who couldn’t make it, here’s a brief resume of what we talked about ![](https://i0.wp.com/www.milanor.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)

And you can explore it using semantic technologies and custom API? **Goran Milovanović,**Data scientist for Wikidata at Wikimedia Deutschland, took us into this new world of opportunities, showing us how you can approach WikiData and Wikiktionary datasets and the R packages you need in order to do this.

Here’s the resources you need to dive into this topics:

### How Advanced Analytics may support strategic price positioning – Alberto Oltolini and Edoardo Oliveri
