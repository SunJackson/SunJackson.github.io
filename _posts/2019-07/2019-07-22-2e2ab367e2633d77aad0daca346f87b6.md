**A**n interesting question (with no clear motivation) on X validated wondering why a Gibbs sampler produces NAs… Interesting because multi-layered:

1. The attached R code indeed produces NAs because it calls the Negative Binomial Neg(x¹,p) random generator with a zero success parameter, x¹=0, which automatically returns NAs. This can be escaped by returning a one (1) instead.

1. The Gibbs sampler is based on a Bin(x²,p) conditional for X¹ and a Neg(x¹,p) conditional for X². When using the most standard version of the Negative Binomial random variate as the number of failures, hence supported on 0,1,2…. these two conditionals are incompatible, i.e., there cannot be a joint distribution behind, which makes the limiting behaviour of the Markov chain harder to study. It however seems to converge to a distribution close to zero.

When using the less standard version of the Negative Binomial random variate as the number of attempts for the conditional on X², the two conditionals are compatible and correspond to a joint proportional to ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%5E%7B-1%7D+%7Bx_1+%5Cchoose+x_2%7D+p%5E%7Bx_2%7D+%281-p%29%5E%7Bx_1-x_2%7D&bg=000000&fg=B0B0B0&s=0&is-pending-load=1)

, however this pmf does not sum up to a finite quantity, hence the resulting Markov chain is at best null recurrent, which seems to be the case for p different from ½. This is unclear for p=½. ![](https://xianblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rplot03.jpeg?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;h=251&fit=450%2C251&resize=450%2C251)
