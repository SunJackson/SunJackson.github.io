In this post we generate a PowerPoint report from a Shiny app. This is Part 2 from the 3-post series about generating reports with Shiny. Part 1 covered Excel Report Generation with Shiny. See part 1 for a quick intro and description of the Shiny app that can generate Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF reports.

These are the slides from the PowerPoint report in our Shiny app:

### Creating a Basic PowerPoint with R

We use the `officer` R package to create the PowerPoint. `officer` connects R to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint (similar to how openxlsx connects R to Excel). We use the flextable package to format our PowerPoint tables.

To begin creating the PowerPoint, we assign a blank PowerPoint to the `ppt_report` variable:

```
library(officer)

ppt_report <- read_pptx()
```

We can now create a PowerPoint file from our `ppt_report` object by using the generic `print()` function and setting `target = ""` as below:

```
print(ppt_report, target = "my_ppt_file.pptx")
# run `?print.rpptx` for more info on the above function
```

The PowerPoint we created above is completely empty, so it’s not terribly interesting. Let’s add a basic title page:

```
library(dplyr)

ppt_report <- ppt_report %>%
 add_slide(
 layout = "Title Slide", 
 master = "Office Theme"
 ) %>%
 ph_with_text(
 type = "ctrTitle", 
 str = c(
 "Example Client Name",
 "Workers' Compensation Claims Report"
 )
 )

print(ppt_report, target = "my_ppt_file.pptx")
```

The new version of our PowerPoint now has a title page.

You can specify the slide theme with the `master` argument to `add_slide()` (“Office Theme” in our above example). All the layouts available with PowerPoint can be set with the `layout` argument. e.g. you can make slides with all the following layouts:

### Using Flextables

`officer` can add tables, but it does not have many table formatting options. For more customized tables we use the `flextable` package.

Check out the code here to see the full formatting of the PowerPoint in our Shiny app.

### Demo App

Below is a complete but very simple Shiny app that can generate a PowerPoint report. Simply run the following directly in your R console to run the app yourself!

```
library(shiny)
library(officer)
library(flextable)
library(dplyr)
 
my_table <- data.frame(
 Name = letters[1:4],
 Age = seq(20, 26, 2),
 Occupation = LETTERS[15:18],
 Income = c(50000, 20000, 30000, 45000)
)
 
ui <- fluidRow(
 column(
 width = 12,
 align = "center",
 tableOutput("data"),
 br(),
 downloadButton("download_powerpoint", "Download Data to PowerPoint")
 )
)
 
server <- function(input, output) {
 output$data <- renderTable({
 my_table
 })
 
 output$download_powerpoint <- downloadHandler(
 filename = function() { 
 "employee_data.pptx"
 },
 content = function(file) {
 flextable_prep <- flextable(my_table) %>% 
 colformat_num(col_keys = c("Age", "Income"), digits = 0) %>% 
 width(width = 1.25) %>% 
 height_all(height = 0.35) %>% 
 theme_zebra() %>% 
 align(align = "center", part = "all")
 
 example_pp <- read_pptx() %>% 
 add_slide(layout = "Title Slide", master = "Office Theme") %>% 
 ph_with_text(
 type = "ctrTitle",
 str = "Employee Data"
 ) %>% 
 ph_with(
 location = ph_location_type(type = "subTitle"),
 value = "Company 2019 Report"
 ) %>% 
 add_slide(layout = "Title and Content", master = "Office Theme") %>% 
 ph_with_text(
 type = "title",
 str = "2019 Data"
 ) %>% 
 ph_with_flextable_at(
 value = flextable_prep,
 left = 2.5,
 top = 2
 )
 
 print(example_pp, target = file)
 }
 )
}
 
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
