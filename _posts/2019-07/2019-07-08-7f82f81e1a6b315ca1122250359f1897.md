**NumPy** is a core-library for scientific computing in Python which provides high performance multidimentional array objects as well as concern tools or attributes for working on these array objects.

However, as a data scientist we generally work with lots of programming libraries and framework. So, it's a good practice to keep note of some essential stuff. That's why I made this notebook for my own reference and now I like to share it, hoping may come handy to someone ðŸ¤“

Fork these notebook-tutorial that covered following contents in details.
