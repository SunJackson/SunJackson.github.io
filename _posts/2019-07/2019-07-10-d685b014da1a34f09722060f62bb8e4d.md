EARL London 2019 is getting closer! Weâ€™ve got a great line up of speakers from a huge range of industries and three fantastic keynote speakers â€“ Helen Hunter â€“ Sainsburyâ€™s, Julia Silge â€“ Stack Overflow and Tim Paulden â€“ ATASS Sports.

Our early bird ticket offer is coming to an end on 31 July, this is your last chance to get EARL tickets at a reduced rate. We hope you can join us for another conference full of inspiration and insights. Also not forgetting our evening networking event, which is the perfect opportunity to catch up with fellow R users over a few (!) free drinks.

Check out our highlights for EARL 2018 below and we hope to see you in September!
