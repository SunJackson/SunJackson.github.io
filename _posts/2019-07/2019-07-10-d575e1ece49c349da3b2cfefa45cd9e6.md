On July 5, the R Core Group released the source code for the latest update to R, R 3.6.1, and binaries are now available to download for Windows, Linux and Mac from your local CRAN mirror.

R 3.6.1 is a minor update to R that fixes a few bugs. As usual with a minor release, this version is backwards-compatible with R 3.6.0 and remains compatible with your installed packages. Nonetheless, an upgrade is recommended to address issues including:

- A fix for "lock errors" when attempting to re-install packages on Windows

- Efficiency improvements and other fixes when using "quasi" links with Generalized Linear Models

- Fixed axis labels for boxplots

- writeClipboard on Windows now supports Unicode, so you can copy text with special characters from R for pasting


See the release notes for the complete list.

By long tradition the code name for this release, "Action of the Toes", is likely a reference to the *Peanuts* comic. If you know specifically which one, let us know in the comments!
