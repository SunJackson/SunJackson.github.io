**Second-Order Semantic Dependency Parsing with End-to-End Neural Networks**

Semantic dependency parsing aims to identify semantic relationships between words in a sentence that form a graph. In this paper, we propose a second-order semantic dependency parser, which takes into consideration not only individual dependency edges but also interactions between pairs of edges. We show that second-order parsing can be approximated using mean field (MF) variational inference or loopy belief propagation (LBP). We can unfold both algorithms as recurrent layers of a neural network and therefore can train the parser in an end-to-end manner. Our experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**Domain Adaptation for Enterprise Email Search**

In the enterprise email search setting, the same search engine often powers multiple enterprises from various industries: technology, education, manufacturing, etc. However, using the same global ranking model across different enterprises may result in suboptimal search quality, due to the corpora differences and distinct information needs. On the other hand, training an individual ranking model for each enterprise may be infeasible, especially for smaller institutions with limited data. To address this data challenge, in this paper we propose a domain adaptation approach that fine-tunes the global model to each individual enterprise. In particular, we propose a novel application of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) approach to information retrieval, which attempts to bridge the gap between the global data distribution and the data distribution for a given individual enterprise. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on a large-scale email search engine, and demonstrate that the MMD approach consistently improves the search quality for multiple individual domains, both in comparison to the global ranking model, as well as several competitive domain adaptation baselines including adversarial learning methods.

**Discovery of Physics from Data: Universal Laws and Discrepancy Models**

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now being used to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing equations from measurement data alone. However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of subtle and nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for the automated discovery of physics. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, such as unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. Without proposing an appropriate discrepancy model to handle these drag forces, the data supports an Aristotelian, versus a Galilean, theory of gravitation. Using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, with the additional assumption that each separate falling object is governed by the same physical law, we are able to identify a viable discrepancy model to account for the fluid dynamic forces that explain the mismatch between a posited universal law of gravity and the measurement data. This work highlights the fact that the simple application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to extract universal physical laws without further modification.

**A simple and effective postprocessing method for image classification**

Whether it is computer vision, natural language processing or speech recognition, the essence of these applications is to obtain powerful feature representations that make downstream applications completion more efficient. Taking image recognition as an example, whether it is hand-crafted low-level feature representation or feature representation extracted by a convolutional neural networks(CNNs), the goal is to extract features that better represent image features, thereby improving classification accuracy. However, we observed that image feature representations share a large common vector and a few top dominating directions. To address this problems, we propose a simple but effective postprocessing method to render off-the-shelf feature representations even stronger by eliminating the common mean vector from off-the-shelf feature representations. The postprocessing is empirically validated on a variety of datasets and feature extraction methods.such as VGG, LBP, and HOG. Some experiments show that the features that have been post-processed by postprocessing algorithm can get better results than original ones.

**A generative approach to unsupervised deep local learning**

Most existing feature learning methods optimize inflexible handcrafted features and the affinity matrix is constructed by shallow linear embedding methods. Different from these conventional methods, we pretrain a generative neural network by stacking convolutional autoencoders to learn the latent data representation and then construct an affinity graph with them as a prior. Based on the pretrained model and the constructed graph, we add a self-expressive layer to complete the generative model and then fine-tune it with a new loss function, including the reconstruction loss and a deliberately defined locality-preserving loss. The locality-preserving loss designed by the constructed affinity graph serves as prior to preserve the local structure during the fine-tuning stage, which in turn improves the quality of feature representation effectively. Furthermore, the self-expressive layer between the encoder and decoder is based on the assumption that each latent feature is a linear combination of other latent features, so the weighted combination coefficients of the self-expressive layer are used to construct a new refined affinity graph for representing the data structure. We conduct experiments on four datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the representation ability of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.

**Batch Active Learning Using Determinantal Point Processes**

Data collection and labeling is one of the main challenges in employing machine learning algorithms in a variety of real-world applications with limited data. While active learning methods attempt to tackle this issue by labeling only the data samples that give high information, they generally suffer from large computational costs and are impractical in settings where data can be collected in parallel. Batch active learning methods attempt to overcome this computational burden by querying batches of samples at a time. To avoid redundancy between samples, previous works rely on some ad hoc combination of sample quality and diversity. In this paper, we present a new principled batch active learning method using Determinantal Point Processes, a repulsive point process that enables generating diverse batches of samples. We develop tractable algorithms to approximate the mode of a DPP distribution, and provide theoretical guarantees on the degree of approximation. We further demonstrate that an iterative greedy method for DPP maximization, which has lower computational costs but worse theoretical guarantees, still gives competitive results for batch active learning. Our experiments show the value of our methods on several datasets against state-of-the-art baselines.

**Multi-Likelihood Methods for Developing Stock Relationship Networks Using Financial Big Data**

Development of stock networks is an important approach to explore the relationship between different stocks in the era of big-data. Although a number of methods have been designed to construct the stock correlation networks, it is still a challenge to balance the selection of prominent correlations and connectivity of networks. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to select essential edges in stock networks and also maintain the connectivity of established networks. This approach uses different threshold values for choosing the edges connecting to a particular stock, rather than employing a single threshold value in the existing asset-value method. The innovation of our algorithm includes the multiple distributions in a maximum likelihood estimator for selecting the threshold value rather than the single distribution estimator in the existing methods. Using the Chinese Shanghai security market data of 151 stocks, we develop a stock relationship network and analyze the topological properties of the developed network. Our results suggest that the proposed method is able to develop networks that maintain appropriate connectivities in the type of assets threshold methods.

**Automatic Source Code Summarization with Extended Tree-LSTM**

Neural machine translation models are used to automatically generate a document from given source code since this can be regarded as a machine translation task. Source code summarization is one of the components for automatic document generation, which generates a summary in natural language from given source code. This suggests that techniques used in neural machine translation, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), can be used for source code summarization. However, there is a considerable difference between source code and natural language: Source code is essentially {\em structured}, having loops and conditional branching, etc. Therefore, there is some obstacle to apply known machine translation models to source code. Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) capture these structural properties and play an important role in recent machine learning studies on source code. Tree-LSTM is proposed as a generalization of LSTMs for tree-structured data. However, there is a critical issue when applying it to ASTs: It cannot handle a tree that contains nodes having an arbitrary number of children and their order simultaneously, which ASTs generally have such nodes. To address this issue, we propose an extension of Tree-LSTM, which we call \emph{Multi-way Tree-LSTM} and apply it for source code summarization. As a result of computational experiments, our proposal achieved better results when compared with several state-of-the-art techniques.

**The Linked Open Data cloud is more abstract, flatter and less linked than you may think!**

This paper presents an empirical study aiming at understanding the modeling style and the overall semantic structure of Linked Open Data. We observe how classes, properties and individuals are used in practice. We also investigate how hierarchies of concepts are structured, and how much they are linked. In addition to discussing the results, this paper contributes (i) a conceptual framework, including a set of metrics, which generalises over the observable constructs; (ii) an open source implementation that facilitates its application to other Linked Data knowledge graphs.

**Transfer NAS: Knowledge Transfer between Search Spaces with Transformer Agents**

Recent advances in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have produced state-of-the-art architectures on several tasks. NAS shifts the efforts of human experts from developing novel architectures directly to designing architecture search spaces and methods to explore them efficiently. The search space definition captures prior knowledge about the properties of the architectures and it is crucial for the complexity and the performance of the search algorithm. However, different search space definitions require restarting the learning process from scratch. We propose a novel agent based on the Transformer that supports joint training and efficient transfer of prior knowledge between multiple search spaces and tasks.

**EditNTS: An Neural Programmer-Interpreter Model for Sentence Simplification through Explicit Editing**

We present the first sentence simplification model that learns explicit edit operations (ADD, DELETE, and KEEP) via a neural programmer-interpreter approach. Most current neural sentence simplification systems are variants of sequence-to-sequence models adopted from machine translation. These methods learn to simplify sentences as a byproduct of the fact that they are trained on complex-simple sentence pairs. By contrast, our neural programmer-interpreter is directly trained to predict explicit edit operations on targeted parts of the input sentence, resembling the way that humans might perform simplification and revision. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural sentence simplification models (without external knowledge) by large margins on three benchmark text simplification corpora in terms of SARI (+0.95 WikiLarge, +1.89 WikiSmall, +1.41 Newsela), and is judged by humans to produce overall better and simpler output sentences.

**Generative Restricted Kernel Machines**

We propose a novel method for estimating generative models based on the Restricted Kernel Machine (RKM) framework. This mechanism uses the shared representation of data from various sources where training only involves solving an eigenvalue problem. By defining an explicit feature map, we show that neural networks could be incorporated in the current framework. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the potential of the model through qualitative evaluation of generated samples.

**Efficient privacy preservation of big data for accurate data mining**

Computing technologies pervade physical spaces and human lives, and produce a vast amount of data that is available for analysis. However, there is a growing concern that potentially sensitive data may become public if the collected data are not appropriately sanitized before being released for investigation. Although there are more than a few privacy-preserving methods available, they are not efficient, scalable or have problems with data utility, and/or privacy. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an efficient and scalable nonreversible perturbation algorithm, PABIDOT, for privacy preservation of big data via optimal geometric transformations. PABIDOT was tested for efficiency, scalability, resistance, and accuracy using nine datasets and five classification algorithms. Experiments show that PABIDOT excels in execution speed, scalability, attack resistance and accuracy in large-scale privacy-preserving data classification when compared with two other, related privacy-preserving algorithms.

**PyRobot: An Open-source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking**

**Incorporating Priors with Feature Attribution on Text Classification**

Feature attribution methods, proposed recently, help users interpret the predictions of complex models. Our approach integrates feature attributions into the objective function to allow machine learning practitioners to incorporate priors in model building. To demonstrate the effectiveness our technique, we apply it to two tasks: (1) mitigating unintended bias in text classifiers by neutralizing identity terms; (2) improving classifier performance in a scarce data setting by forcing the model to focus on toxic terms. Our approach adds an L2 distance loss between feature attributions and task-specific prior values to the objective. Our experiments show that i) a classifier trained with our technique reduces undesired model biases without a trade off on the original task; ii) incorporating priors helps model performance in scarce data settings.

**Embedding time expressions for deep temporal ordering models**

Data-driven models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in inferring the temporal ordering of events in text. However, these models often overlook explicit temporal signals, such as dates and time windows. Rule-based methods can be used to identify the temporal links between these time expressions (timexes), but they fail to capture timexes’ interactions with events and are hard to integrate with the distributed representations of neural net models. In this paper, we introduce a framework to infuse temporal awareness into such models by learning a pre-trained model to embed timexes. We generate synthetic data consisting of pairs of timexes, then train a character LSTM to learn embeddings and classify the timexes’ temporal relation. We evaluate the utility of these embeddings in the context of a strong neural model for event temporal ordering, and show a small increase in performance on the MATRES dataset and more substantial gains on an automatically collected dataset with more frequent event-timex interactions.

**Model-free posterior inference on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve**

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) serves as a summary of a binary classifier’s performance. Methods for estimating the AUC have been developed under a binormality assumption which restricts the distribution of the score produced by the classifier. However, this assumption introduces an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter and can be inappropriate, especially in the context of machine learning. This motivates us to adopt a model-free Gibbs posterior distribution for the AUC. We present the asymptotic Gibbs posterior concentration rate, and a strategy for tuning the learning rate so that the corresponding credible intervals achieve the nominal frequentist coverage probability. Simulation experiments and a real data analysis demonstrate the Gibbs posterior’s strong performance compared to existing methods based on a rank likelihood.

**SwiftNet: Using Graph Propagation as Meta-knowledge to Search Highly Representative Neural Architectures**

Designing neural architectures for edge devices is subject to constraints of accuracy, inference latency, and computational cost. Traditionally, researchers manually craft deep neural networks to meet the needs of mobile devices. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) was proposed to automate the neural architecture design without requiring extensive domain expertise and significant manual efforts. Recent works utilized NAS to design mobile models by taking into account hardware constraints and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer parameters and less computational cost measured in Multiply-accumulates (MACs). To find highly compact neural architectures, existing works relies on predefined cells and directly applying width multiplier, which may potentially limit the model flexibility, reduce the useful feature map information, and cause accuracy drop. To conquer this issue, we propose GRAM(GRAph propagation as Meta-knowledge) that adopts fine-grained (node-wise) search method and accumulates the knowledge learned in updates into a meta-graph. As a result, GRAM can enable more flexible search space and achieve higher search efficiency. Without the constraints of predefined cell or blocks, we propose a new structure-level pruning method to remove redundant operations in neural architectures. SwiftNet, which is a set of models discovered by GRAM, outperforms MobileNet-V2 by 2.15x higher accuracy density and 2.42x faster with similar accuracy. Compared with FBNet, SwiftNet reduces the search cost by 26x and achieves 2.35x higher accuracy density and 1.47x speedup while preserving similar accuracy. SwiftNetcan obtain 63.28% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only 53M MACs and 2.07M parameters. The corresponding inference latency is only 19.09 ms on Google Pixel 1.

**The Functional Neural Process**

We present a new family of exchangeable stochastic processes, the Functional Neural Processes (FNPs). FNPs model distributions over functions by learning a graph of dependencies on top of latent representations of the points in the given dataset. In doing so, they define a Bayesian model without explicitly positing a prior distribution over latent global parameters; they instead adopt priors over the relational structure of the given dataset, a task that is much simpler. We show how we can learn such models from data, demonstrate that they are scalable to large datasets through mini-batch optimization and describe how we can make predictions for new points via their posterior predictive distribution. We experimentally evaluate FNPs on the tasks of toy regression and image classification and show that, when compared to baselines that employ global latent parameters, they offer both competitive predictions as well as more robust uncertainty estimates.

**Learning Patient Engagement in Care Management: Performance vs. Interpretability**

The health outcomes of high-need patients can be substantially influenced by the degree of patient engagement in their own care. The role of care managers includes that of enrolling patients into care programs and keeping them sufficiently engaged in the program, so that patients can attain various goals. The attainment of these goals is expected to improve the patients’ health outcomes. In this paper, we present a real world data-driven method and the behavioral engagement scoring pipeline for scoring the engagement level of a patient in two regards: (1) Their interest in enrolling into a relevant care program, and (2) their interest and commitment to program goals. We use this score to predict a patient’s propensity to respond (i.e., to a call for enrollment into a program, or to an assigned program goal). Using real-world care management data, we show that our scoring method successfully predicts patient engagement. We also show that we are able to provide interpretable insights to care managers, using prototypical patients as a point of reference, without sacrificing prediction performance.

**Learning Compressed Sentence Representations for On-Device Text Processing**

Vector representations of sentences, trained on massive text corpora, are widely used as generic sentence embeddings across a variety of NLP problems. The learned representations are generally assumed to be continuous and real-valued, giving rise to a large memory footprint and slow retrieval speed, which hinders their applicability to low-resource (memory and computation) platforms, such as mobile devices. In this paper, we propose four different strategies to transform continuous and generic sentence embeddings into a binarized form, while preserving their rich semantic information. The introduced methods are evaluated across a wide range of downstream tasks, where the binarized sentence embeddings are demonstrated to degrade performance by only about 2% relative to their continuous counterparts, while reducing the storage requirement by over 98%. Moreover, with the learned binary representations, the semantic relatedness of two sentences can be evaluated by simply calculating their Hamming distance, which is more computational efficient compared with the inner product operation between continuous embeddings. Detailed analysis and case study further validate the effectiveness of proposed methods.
