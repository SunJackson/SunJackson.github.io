Some exciting personal news: I’ve *(finally)* graduated from The Cooper
Union, and I’m joining Point72 Asset
Management as a data scientist/research analyst!

Point72 is an American hedge fund, headquartered in Connecticut. I’ll be based
in New York, working out of their Hudson
Yards offices.

In this next chapter of my life, my professional focuses are:

1. **Keep learning.** Bayesian methods and deep learning, mostly.

**Open source.** I’ve been involved with developing
PyMC4. These are exciting times for the
PyMC project: I hope to keep contributing!

My four years of college were incredibly rewarding, but I’m excited to enter the
real world. Stay tuned!
