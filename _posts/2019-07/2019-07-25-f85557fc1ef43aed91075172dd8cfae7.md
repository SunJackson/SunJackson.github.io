Across every industry, engineers and scientists are racing to prepare massive amounts of data for AI and machine learning (ML) advancements. Analyst firm Cognilytica estimates that as much as 80% of machine learning project time is spent on aggregating, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting machine learning model data. And a mere 20% of ML project time is spent on algorithm development, model training and tuning, and ML operationalization.

**Major Data Labeling Challenges** 

Although innovation seems boundless, teams are hampered by the fact that well-prepared data are difficult to come by.  There are two well-established considerations in this equation: 

High-quality data labeling yields better model performance, but when data labeling is low quality, machine learning models struggle to learn. 
It’s best to deploy top-notch and high-dollar talent such as data scientists and machine learning engineers on tasks that require deep expertise, collaboration, and analytical skills. 

**The Billion Dollar Question**

So, how do innovative machine learning teams prepare data in such a way that they can trust its quality, cost of preparation, and the speed with which it’s delivered?

**Key Takeaway: Comparing Data Labelers for Machine Learning**

A growing number of organizations are using one or more of *these four options* to source data labelers for machine learning projects. Each choice brings benefits and challenges, depending on project needs, but for most organizations, understanding the tradeoffs helps pave the way for a clear strategic data labeling roadmap.

**Critical Questions to Ask When Sourcing a Data Labeling Team**

It only takes 10-15 minutes to read the full study, but if you don’t have time, we strongly suggest you ask potential workforce vendors these questions as they compare data labeling workforce options:

Scale – Can your labeling team increase or decrease the number of tasks they do for us, based on demand?
Quality – Can you provide us with visibility into work quality and worker productivity?
