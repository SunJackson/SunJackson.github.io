After an exciting kick-off at EGG NYC, the human-centered AI conference is back, this time in London. Tomorrow, July 2nd, data professionals, academics and enthusiasts across different countries, industries and backgrounds, will come together to talk about the future of AI. EGG puts the spotlight on humanity and empathy in AI, diving into real-world use cases and hot topics such as machine learning interpretability, bias and fairness.

Whether you’re attending EGG LDN in person, planning to watch the live stream or simply curious about it, here are three main themes that our speakers and guests will be discussing tomorrow.

## 1. Ethical Challenges and Achieving Responsible Enterprise AI

From biased algorithms and data privacy concerns to deepfake imagery, the ethical implications of data has never been more crucial to restoring people’s faith and trust in the future of AI. Our speakers will talk about these issues, as well as discuss strategies for organizations and data practitioners to ensure an ethical approach to AI.

Here are all of the speakers and talks about responsible AI:

- **Algorithmic Bias, Privacy Protection and EU Non-Discrimination Law.**Dr. Sandra Wachter, Senior Research Fellow in Data Science and AI @University of Oxford
