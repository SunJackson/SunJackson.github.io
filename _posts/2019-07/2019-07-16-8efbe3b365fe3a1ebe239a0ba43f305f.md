The European R conference will **visit Milan in 2020!** Mirai Solutions is delighted to actively support and participate in the organization of the event.



The European R Users Meeting (eRum) is a biennial conference, taking place in Europe during those years when the useR is held overseas. It is a unique chance for R practitioners to get together, exchange experiences, broaden their knowledge around R and initiate collaborations with like-minded people. After Poznan in 2016, and Budapest in 2018, the 2020 edition will take place in **Milan, Italy, through May 27-30**, as announced officially by Miraier Francesca and co-organizers at useR! 2019 in Toulouse.
