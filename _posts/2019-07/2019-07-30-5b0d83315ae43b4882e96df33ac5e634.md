I was recently asked if Win-Vector LLC would move the R wrapr package from a GPL-3 license to an LGPL license. In the end I decided to move wrapr distribution to a “GPL-2 | GPL-3” license. This means the package is now available under both GPL-2 and GPL-3 licensing, allowing the user to pick which of these two licenses they wish to accept the software under. I decided to stick to “GPL-*” style licensing as I endorse the values underlying these licenses, and my (not-legal advice, I am not a lawyer!) *opinion* this is the licensing pattern closest to the license R itself is distributed under (and hence the closest to the values of the core R community).

Please read on for some background issues I found (not-legal advice, I am not a lawyer!)




In my *opinion* there seems to be no convenient way to simultaneously avoid both the GPL-2 and GPL-3 licenses when working with R as R itself is under a “GPL-2 | GPL-3” license (as are many of its popular packages). So likely anyone who feels they must avoid simultaneously both the GPL-2 and the GPL-3 licenses should probably avoid CRAN R altogether. Now the issue is complicated (and there are some distinctions about interpreters, APIs, and distribution): but it really appears if you are using R and some of its popular packages you are likely using software components distributed with GPL-2, GPL-3, “GPL-2 | GPL-3”, and other licenses.

One thing to keep clear: despite the similarity in names the various GNU-license families, LGPL-**, GPL-
