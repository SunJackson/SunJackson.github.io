**Semantic Web for Machine Translation: Challenges and Directions**

A large number of machine translation approaches have recently been developed to facilitate the fluid migration of content across languages. However, the literature suggests that many obstacles must still be dealt with to achieve better automatic translations. One of these obstacles is lexical and syntactic ambiguity. A promising way of overcoming this problem is using Semantic Web technologies. This article is an extended abstract of our systematic review on machine translation approaches that rely on Semantic Web technologies for improving the translation of texts. Overall, we present the challenges and opportunities in the use of Semantic Web technologies in Machine Translation. Moreover, our research suggests that while Semantic Web technologies can enhance the quality of machine translation outputs for various problems, the combination of both is still in its infancy.

**Improving the Accuracy of Principal Component Analysis by the Maximum Entropy Method**

Classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approximates data in terms of projections on a small number of orthogonal vectors. There are simple procedures to efficiently compute various functions of the data from the PCA approximation. The most important function is arguably the Euclidean distance between data items, This can be used, for example, to solve the approximate nearest neighbor problem. We use random variables to model the inherent uncertainty in such approximations, and apply the Maximum Entropy Method to infer the underlying probability distribution. We propose using the expected values of distances between these random variables as improved estimates of the distance. We show by analysis and experimentally that in most cases results obtained by our method are more accurate than what is obtained by the classical approach. This improves the accuracy of a classical technique that have been used with little change for over 100 years.

**The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Augmenting a black-box model with expert knowledge**

We address a non-unique parameter fitting problem in the context of material science. In particular, we propose to resolve ambiguities in parameter space by augmenting a black-box artificial neural network (ANN) model with two different levels of expert knowledge and benchmark them against a pure black-box model.

**Deep Generative Quantile-Copula Models for Probabilistic Forecasting**

We introduce a new category of multivariate conditional generative models and demonstrate its performance and versatility in probabilistic time series forecasting and simulation. Specifically, the output of quantile regression networks is expanded from a set of fixed quantiles to the whole Quantile Function by a univariate mapping from a latent uniform distribution to the target distribution. Then the multivariate case is solved by learning such quantile functions for each dimension’s marginal distribution, followed by estimating a conditional Copula to associate these latent uniform random variables. The quantile functions and copula, together defining the joint predictive distribution, can be parameterized by a single implicit generative Deep Neural Network.

**Benchmarking TPU, GPU, and CPU Platforms for Deep Learning**

Training deep learning models is compute-intensive and there is an industry-wide trend towards hardware specialization to improve performance. To systematically benchmark deep learning platforms, we introduce ParaDnn, a parameterized benchmark suite for deep learning that generates end-to-end models for fully connected (FC), convolutional (CNN), and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. Along with six real-world models, we benchmark Google’s Cloud TPU v2/v3, NVIDIA’s V100 GPU, and an Intel Skylake CPU platform. We take a deep dive into TPU architecture, reveal its bottlenecks, and highlight valuable lessons learned for future specialized system design. We also provide a thorough comparison of the platforms and find that each has unique strengths for some types of models. Finally, we quantify the rapid performance improvements that specialized software stacks provide for the TPU and GPU platforms.

**Careful Selection of Knowledge to solve Open Book Question Answering**

Open book question answering is a type of natural language based QA (NLQA) where questions are expected to be answered with respect to a given set of open book facts, and common knowledge about a topic. Recently a challenge involving such QA, OpenBookQA, has been proposed. Unlike most other NLQA tasks that focus on linguistic understanding, OpenBookQA requires deeper reasoning involving linguistic understanding as well as reasoning with common knowledge. In this paper we address QA with respect to the OpenBookQA dataset and combine state of the art language models with abductive information retrieval (IR), information gain based re-ranking, passage selection and weighted scoring to achieve 72.0% accuracy, an 11.6% improvement over the current state of the art.

**Visual Interaction with Deep Learning Models through Collaborative Semantic Inference**

Automation of tasks can have critical consequences when humans lose agency over decision processes. Deep learning models are particularly susceptible since current black-box approaches lack explainable reasoning. We argue that both the visual interface and model structure of deep learning systems need to take into account interaction design. We propose a framework of collaborative semantic inference (CSI) for the co-design of interactions and models to enable visual collaboration between humans and algorithms. The approach exposes the intermediate reasoning process of models which allows semantic interactions with the visual metaphors of a problem, which means that a user can both understand and control parts of the model reasoning process. We demonstrate the feasibility of CSI with a co-designed case study of a document summarization system.

**Sampled Softmax with Random Fourier Features**

The computational cost of training with softmax cross entropy loss grows linearly with the number of classes. For the settings where a large number of classes are involved, a common method to speed up training is to sample a subset of classes and utilize an estimate of the gradient based on these classes, known as the sampled softmax method. However, the sampled softmax provides a biased estimate of the gradient unless the samples are drawn from the exact softmax distribution, which is again expensive to compute. Therefore, a widely employed practical approach (without theoretical justification) involves sampling from a simpler distribution in the hope of approximating the exact softmax distribution. In this paper, we develop the first theoretical understanding of the role that different sampling distributions play in determining the quality of sampled softmax. Motivated by our analysis and the work on kernel-based sampling, we propose the Random Fourier Softmax (RF-softmax) method that utilizes the powerful Random Fourier features to enable more efficient and accurate sampling from the (approximate) softmax distribution. We show that RF-softmax leads to low bias in estimation in terms of both the full softmax distribution and the full softmax gradient. Furthermore, the cost of RF-softmax scales only logarithmically with the number of classes.

**Optuna: A Next-generation Hyperparameter Optimization Framework**

**Convolutional Neural Networks on Randomized Data**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are build specifically for computer vision tasks for which it is known that the input data is a hierarchical structure based on locally correlated elements. The question that naturally arises is what happens with the performance of CNNs if one of the basic properties of the data is removed, e.g. what happens if the image pixels are randomly permuted? Intuitively one expects that the convolutional network performs poorly in these circumstances in contrast to a multilayer perceptron (MLPs) whose classification accuracy should not be affected by the pixel randomization. This work shows that by randomizing image pixels the hierarchical structure of the data is destroyed and long range correlations are introduced which standard CNNs are not able to capture. We show that their classification accuracy is heavily dependent on the class similarities as well as the pixel randomization process. We also indicate that dilated convolutions are able to recover some of the pixel correlations and improve the performance.

**Overfitting of neural nets under class imbalance: Analysis and improvements for segmentation**

Overfitting in deep learning has been the focus of a number of recent works, yet its exact impact on the behavior of neural networks is not well understood. This study analyzes overfitting by examining how the distribution of logits alters in relation to how much the model overfits. Specifically, we find that when training with few data samples, the distribution of logit activations when processing unseen test samples of an under-represented class tends to shift towards and even across the decision boundary, while the over-represented class seems unaffected. In image segmentation, foreground samples are often heavily under-represented. We observe that sensitivity of the model drops as a result of overfitting, while precision remains mostly stable. Based on our analysis, we derive asymmetric modifications of existing loss functions and regularizers including a large margin loss, focal loss, adversarial training and mixup, which specifically aim at reducing the shift observed when embedding unseen samples of the under-represented class. We study the case of binary segmentation of brain tumor core and show that our proposed simple modifications lead to significantly improved segmentation performance over the symmetric variants.

**An Empirical Analysis of the Python Package Index (PyPI)**

In this research, we provide a comprehensive empirical summary of the Python Package Repository, PyPI, including both package metadata and source code covering 178,592 packages, 1,745,744 releases, 76,997 contributors, and 156,816,750 import statements. We provide counts and trends for packages, releases, dependencies, category classifications, licenses, and package imports, as well as authors, maintainers, and organizations. As one of the largest and oldest software repositories as of publication, PyPI provides insight not just into the Python ecosystem today, but also trends in software development and licensing more broadly over time. Within PyPI, we find that the growth of the repository has been robust under all measures, with a compound annual growth rate of 18.3\% for active packages, 15.5\% for new authors, and 27\% for new import statements over the last 15 years. As with many similar social systems, we find a number of highly right-skewed distributions, including the distribution of releases per package, packages and releases per author, imports per package, and size per package and release. However, we also find that most packages are contributed by single individuals, not multiple individuals or organizations. The data, methods, and calculations herein provide an anchor for public discourse on PyPI and serve as a foundation for future research on the Python software ecosystem.

**Graph Neural Lasso for Dynamic Network Regression**

In this paper, we will study the dynamic network regression problem, which focuses on inferring both individual entities’ changing attribute values and the dynamic relationships among the entities in the network data simultaneously. To resolve the problem, a novel graph neural network, namely graph neural lasso (GNL), will be proposed in this paper. To model the real-time changes of nodes in the network, GNL extends gated diffusive unit (GDU) to the regression scenario and uses it as the basic neuron unit. GNL can effectively model the dynamic relationships among the nodes based on an attention mechanism.

**Google Research Football: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Environment**

Recent progress in the field of reinforcement learning has been accelerated by virtual learning environments such as video games, where novel algorithms and ideas can be quickly tested in a safe and reproducible manner. We introduce the Google Research Football Environment, a new reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play football in an advanced, physics-based 3D simulator. The resulting environment is challenging, easy to use and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license. In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.

**Real-time Event Detection on Social Data Streams**

Social networks are quickly becoming the primary medium for discussing what is happening around real-world events. The information that is generated on social platforms like Twitter can produce rich data streams for immediate insights into ongoing matters and the conversations around them. To tackle the problem of event detection, we model events as a list of clusters of trending entities over time. We describe a real-time system for discovering events that is modular in design and novel in scale and speed: it applies clustering on a large stream with millions of entities per minute and produces a dynamically updated set of events. In order to assess clustering methodologies, we build an evaluation dataset derived from a snapshot of the full Twitter Firehose and propose novel metrics for measuring clustering quality. Through experiments and system profiling, we highlight key results from the offline and online pipelines. Finally, we visualize a high profile event on Twitter to show the importance of modeling the evolution of events, especially those detected from social data streams.
