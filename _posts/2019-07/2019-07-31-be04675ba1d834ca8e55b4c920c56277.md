When it comes to AI, there’s plenty of talk of the future of machines. But it’s the people behind AI development who have the insights needed to shape that future. We asked a DSS Miami panel of speakers to weigh in on business applications of AI and data science for optimal efficiency and growth. 

Looking at hospitality systems, a combination of AI tools and human interaction can revolutionize customer service. “A chatbot can be used to modify or cancel a reservation, thereby eliminating the need to call customer support and consequently saving time and transaction costs,” said Dalela Bharati, Product Owner of Data and Metrics at Booking.com. If bots can handle the most basic customer needs in a timely manner, human efforts can be saved for the tasks that most heavily require person-to-person communication, such as, but not limited to, customized event planning. 

However, AI itself, in the form of predictive analytics, can also enhance businesses’ abilities to make customer experiences mode personalized. “Data science has enabled us to better predict our customers demands and purchase behaviour and match it with supply from our partners, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and overall revenues,” said Bharati. Building on this fact, Associate Data Scientist in Customer Care Strategy & Analytics at Florida Light and Power explained, “Data science helps us be more precise in our planning and execution. We’re able to better forecast our call volumes, predict when people will call and why they are calling.” 

The healthcare industry has recently seen parallel developments to those found in hospitality. Sangeeta Krishnan, Data Solutions Architect at Daugherty Business Solutions, noticed that “the adoption of AI applications in the pharmaceutical process is bound to bring in personalized therapy options for the patient.” AI tools can identify the methods of therapy needed for each individual patient and the healthcare providers themselves can devote their time to delivering these therapies. 

As AI’s influence on customer-centric systems grows, issues of ethics and privacy will become increasingly prevalent. Nathan Black, Co-founder and Chief Data Scientist at QuantHub, claimed that the rise of “citizen data scientists, employees and business managers who apply data science methodologies in non-data science roles,” will make the use of AI commonplace across company departments. This may amplify the growth of which AI is capable of engineering, while also increasing the risks of technology misuse. Mediating these risks will require more and more diligence from data science teams. “There isn’t a decision made at FPL without considering how it could potentially impact customers,” said Arango. “We have extensive policies in place to help ensure our customers’ privacy.” 

Overall, industry influencers remain hopeful that AI’s integration into existing systems will lead to positive outcomes, especially if those on the forefront of innovation communicate consistently and effectively. In Bharati’s words, “The data science community will continue to grow, and while it is difficult to predict whether techniques and solutions will converge, I am highly optimistic about the collaboration opportunities it could present fuelled by knowledge exchange events such as Data Science Salon.”
