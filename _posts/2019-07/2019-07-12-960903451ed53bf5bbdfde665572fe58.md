**By Admond Lee, Micron Technology / AI Time Journal / Tech in Asia**

I always believe that in order to learn effectively, we have to learn from the best.

If youâ€™ve been following my work, I started out in data science as a physics student two years ago with **ZERO knowledge of data science.**

And I managed to transition from physics into data science within a year.

Indeed, I struggled a lot. I made a lot of mistakes.

I failed forward. Picked myself up. And moved forward again.

When I reflected back on my data science journey and how far Iâ€™ve come to this stage, what has actually brought me up to speed throughout my learning journey is that I learned (and still learning!) from the best data science leadersâ€Šâ€”â€Špeople who are experts in data science â€”through their sharing.

And that has tremendously helped my data science journey to become a data scientist as they regularly share their real life experience in data science, the latest technology and tools being used, the technical and non-technical knowledge, and many moreâ€¦

In fact, these data science leaders are just part of the awesome data science community on LinkedIn and they are the one who inspired me to give back to the community by sharing my experience and knowledge along the way on LinkedIn and Medium.

Hence this article (and other articles on Medium) youâ€™re reading now.

**If youâ€™re in the data science field, I strongly encourage you to follow these giantsâ€Š**â€”â€Šwhich Iâ€™ll list down in the section belowâ€Šâ€”â€Šand be a part of our data science community to learn from the best and share your experience and knowledge.

Letâ€™s get started!

 

### Top 10 Data Science Leaders You Should Follow

**1. Randy Lao**

Randy Lao is seriously awesome. In fact, he was the first data science leader that I followed when I first started out, knowing nothing about data science.

If youâ€™re an aspiring data scientist, I highly recommend you to check out his website that has all the useful **FREE data science and machine learning resources** shared with you.

Most importantly, he is also a Data Science Mentor at Data Science Dream Job, an E-Learning platform that helps aspiring data scientists grow and get jobsâ€Šâ€”â€Šfounded by Kyle McKiou.

With his sharing and broad experience in the data science space, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll learn a lot from him, which I did.

 **2. Kyle McKiou**

You may have already heard of his name before if youâ€™re active on LinkedIn.

As mentioned, Kyle is the founder of **Data Science Dream Job** that teaches aspiring data scientists from different backgrounds how to get jobs in data science space.

The course by itself is worth more than anything as he and other amazing mentors teach aspiring data scientists the mindset, technical and non-technical skills, job search techniques and how to ultimately get their careers started in this industry.

This is not just another online course on Udemy or Coursera that only teaches technical skills in programming or machine learning.

Kyle also regularly shares his experience and insights in data science on LinkedIn with the data science community.

If you want to get into data scienceâ€Šâ€”â€Ševen you have no background whatsoeverâ€Šâ€”â€Šthen follow Kyle and check out his course.

 **3. Kirill Eremenko**

Kirill Eremenko is the founder and CEO of SuperDataScience, an online educational portal for Data Scientists.

The companyâ€™s mission is to â€œMake The Complex Simpleâ€� with the vision of becoming the biggest learning portal for Data Science enthusiasts.

Also, the platform features dozens of analytics courses ranging from tool-based courses such as R Programming, Python, Tableau to over-arching courses like Machine Learning A-Z and introduction to Data Science.

My personal favourite course: Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks taught by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. This was my first exposure to deep learning and trust me, their course is truly one-of-a-kind with great emphasis on the instinctive level of understanding with hands-on coding tutorials on Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning.

And recently, I had the chance to read his bookâ€Šâ€”â€ŠConfident Data Skills****that helps you understand the complete data science workflow from start till the end of projects, all with zero code!

 **4. Favio VÃ¡zquez**

Favio VÃ¡zquez has deep experience in data science and he is always willing to share his thoughts and insights on LinkedIn with no reservation.

Personally, Iâ€™m a fan of one of his YouTube channelsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠData Science Office Hours, with other amazing data science leaders that shared their experience in different topics.

I canâ€™t tell you how much I learned just from their webinars alone.

Because at the end of the day, as an aspiring data scientist, you can take a lot of online courses and certificates and learn as much as you can. But if youâ€™re not able to understand how data scientists work in real working environment, youâ€™ll not be able to apply what youâ€™ve learned from those courses.

Youâ€™ll not be able to understand the role as a data scientist.

Therefore, learning from data scientists has always been my preferred way of learning and exploring.

 **5. Eric Weber**

Eric was a senior data scientist at LinkedIn and now is working at CoreLogic as the Principal of Data Management & Data Science.

One thing I really like about Eric is his sharp observation of the current landscape in data science.

He is always willing to share his knowledge and experience to demystify some of the common yet forgotten areas in data science that have never failed to amaze me.

Eric was one of the data science leaders whom Iâ€™ve been following ever since I joined the LinkedIn data science community. Thereâ€™s just so much to learn from him and I canâ€™t wait to share with you in future!

 **6. Kate Strachnyi**

Kate is famously known as Author of The Disruptors: Data Science Leaders.

She is also the host of Datacated Weeklyâ€Šâ€”â€Ša project dedicated to helping others learn about various topics in the data realmâ€” as well as the host of Humans of Data Science (HoDS) on my Story by Data YouTube channel.

She also interviewed some of the data science leaders in this article so I strongly encourage you to check out her YouTube channel if you want to learn about various topics in the data realm.

As you may have already realized, the data science community on LinkedIn is close-knit community where we interact with one another to share and learn together.

 **7. Tarry Singh**

Tarry Singh is the founder and CEO of deepkapha.ai that brings AI solutions to companies and enterprises besides contributing to AI research and philanthropy.

Tarryâ€™s passion in using deep learning and AI to solve real world problems inspired me to give back to the society using data when I first started out in data science.

Follow his work and sharing. Youâ€™ll be amazed by his thoughts and sharing, especially on the latest cutting edge technology in AI.

 **8. Imaad Mohamed Khan**

Imaad Mohamed Khan is currently a data scientist at Indegene.

His posts are always so inspiring and straight to the point on any topic in data science.

Besides, Imaad also organizes Mantissa Data Science meetups in India from time to time to give everyone an opportunity to share and voice their thoughts while learning together at the same time.

He is definitely one of the data scientist that I always look forward to learning from.

 **9. Andreas Kretz**

Whenever we talk about data science, most people tend to think that itâ€™s all about building cool machine learning models and making awesome predictions.

In reality, building models is just a part of the whole workflow and data engineering (aka plumber of data science) is the crucial part of this workflow that supports data science projects.

Without a stable and solid data engineering pipeline and platform, itâ€™ll be hard time to even get data to perform any analysis at the first place.

Andreas is truly an expert on his own when it comes to **data engineering and building up big data platforms** to support data science projects.

He is a data engineer and data science platform architect, building data science platforms that process and analyse insane amounts of data every day.

If you want to learn more about data engineering stuff like Hadoop, Spark and Kafka, go ahead and check out his YouTube channelâ€Šâ€”â€ŠPlumbers of Data Science.

 **10. Andriy Burkov**

Andriyâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe director of data science and machine learning team leader at Gartnerâ€Šâ€”â€Šcan be considered as one of the data science leaders and celebrities on LinkedIn with his well-known best-selling bookâ€Šâ€”â€ŠThe Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book.

His popular book has been translated to different languages for different countries (Even included in some universitiesâ€™ libraries and courses as teaching materials!).

He also shares tons of useful data science tips regularly (almost everyday!) on LinkedIn and Iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t want to miss that.
