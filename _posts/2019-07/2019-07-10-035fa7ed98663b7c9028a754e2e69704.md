Insurance fraud is a major issue that drives up healthcare costs for insurers, providers, taxpayers, and patients. The risk of unnecessary or nonexistent medical services due to misrepresentations by patients or providers is a costly one; in the U.S. the National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association estimates that payers spend up to $68 billion a year due to fraud. Using publicly available data (and Dataiku DSS,) we dove into exploring what Medicare fraud might include.

## The Data

Access to Medicare data is critical to understanding fraud. While many of these datasets require extensive cleaning to make them usable, they supply the knowledge base upon which understanding can grow. Some datasets that can help include:


Medicare Part D data sets are available here. These sets include annual prescriptions aggregated at the physician and drug level, as well as information on the physician (National Physician ID, name, city, postal code, ... etc.).


Additional PartD data is available on the Propublica website, and can help expand the date range under consideration. 


Physician kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies can influence what drugs are prescribed. US law requires physicians to publicly disclose payments they receive from pharmaceutical companies.


FDA datasets can expand a project's vocabulary of drug type and active ingredients. 


## A first model

A simplified first model focuses on physician fraudsters, and will be oversimplified to exclude patient fraud. Thus, the most interesting dataset for this is PartD, which contains the total number of times each physician prescribed a particular drug along with the total cost that represents. Using this information, we should be able to evaluate the statistical possibility of each physician to be a fraudster. We expect fraudulent physicians to have a higher average total prescription cost (because what would be the point of committing fraud for small amounts of money?)

But things are often not that simple: some physicians prescribe a lot of drugs (e.g. general practitioners) or highly expensive drugs (e.g. oncologists.) So a high total cost is not a clear indication of fraud. Thus, exploring the variance of the cost—is one expensive drug being prescribed along with a host of more quotidian medicines—against the maximum cost. 

By exploring fraudster motivations, perhaps we can further improve performance. Context is always critical in establishing accura

te models and industry insights go a long way towards that goal. How would a physician defraud Medicare? Either through fake prescriptions (likely with recreational drugs) or by charging Medicare too much for cheaper drugs.

Since some drugs will be easier (or more lucrative) to defraud Medicare, specific prescriptions can help establish fraud detection. By counting the number of times a drug was prescribed fraudulently, we can see which repeat prescriptions might indicate a higher probability of fraud.

## Context is Key

Many of these drugs fit expectations surrounding fraud. Lidocaine is used to dilute cocaine, while Opana, Suboxone, Oxycodone, Oxymorphone and Methadone are addictive opioids. Amphetamine has recreational purposes. 

Other ways context can inform this model would include a more rigorous examination of individual drugs or physician pharmaceutical relationships. If large pharmaceutical payouts are linked to fraud, that might improve prediction performance. When we added this information we found that payments are actually *negatively *correlated with fraud (perhaps because fraudsters want to stay under the radar).
