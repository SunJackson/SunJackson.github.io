### Introduction and Background

 I am an organizer for two New York city meetup groups: NYC Women in Machine Learning & Data Science and NYC PyLadies.

I attended college in the 90â€™s and mentorship is not something that was discussed at the time. In recent years, I have heard the conversation of â€œfind a mentor, you need a mentor to advance your career.â€�

In early 2018, when I first began writing and when my fastai_deep_learningGitHub repository of documentation received increased traffic, I received numerous requests from readers around the world to be their mentor. These requests encouraged me to think more closely about mentorship and the general expectations in the data science community.

 

### Survey on Mentoring

 I held certain beliefs about asking for mentorship, but thought I would ask around and see what others thought prior to writing a blog. In early 2019, I investigated this further by interviewing colleagues and conducting a survey on mentoring. The survey was distributed on Slack, Twitter and LinkedIn and 50 people responded. 70% of respondents did not have a mentor, 55% had never been a mentor and 90% wanted to obtain a mentor. **The demand for mentors is high; the supply is low.**

 

### Definitions

 This research elucidated that there are various understandings of what a â€œmentorâ€� is and the roles can be categorized primarily in five ways which are Mentor, Sponsor, Tutor, Career Coach and Therapist.

**Mentor**

Provides advice, support and guidance
Provides guidance on navigating work situations
Offers feedback; provide constructive criticism
Shares technical resources and expertise
Helps to find solutions
Shares different perspectives

**Sponsor**

Generally someone more senior and established in the field
Opens up new opportunities for people
Provides a connection to a valuable network of people and resources; provides introductions
Advocates for them at work or other professional situations
Provides opportunity for advancement to the next level

**Tutor**

specific, technical expertise (programming languages, algorithms, software engineering)

**Job / Career Coach**

Develops skills related to public speaking and networking effectively
Action-oriented
Provides guidance on emotional intelligence skills
Advises on navigating political situations
Managing stress

**Therapist / Psychologist**

Helps patients/clients make decisions and clarify feelings in order to solve problems
Provides support and guidance

The good news is that depending on the support needed, the last few roles, tutors, career coaches and therapists, are people who can be hired and are accessible.

CodementorX provides technical tutoring on a variety of programming languages. Even though the word â€œmentorâ€� is in its name, it is more accurately paid technical tutoring.

 

### Avenues to Obtain Mentorship

 These seem to be a few main avenues for obtaining mentorship:

Work, formal programs
Work, informal connection
School
Outside of work; community

Large companies have structured, established programs. For people who are seeking mentors, it is a good idea to work at a larger company.

Also, when choosing a job, choose a boss over the company because your direct supervisor and your relationship with your manager has the greatest influence over the direction of your career.


 

### What is the best way to find a mentor?

 This is advice from others:

Ask someone you know
Ask someone you know to recommend someone

 

### Understanding the Demand for Mentorship

 Looking back at the numerous companies where I worked, I was fortunate that at times, particularly earlier in my career, I had inspiring managers or colleagues who were knowledgeable, patient and generous with their time. But, for the majority of organizations, my managers were generally unavailable, uncommunicative and indifferent about offering opportunities or encouraging career growth. I think it is almost expected that one should leave the company for better opportunities. I think that could be due in large part to being in the field of statistics.

I was continuously searching for a supportive manager, just as the elusive, non-existent â€œFountain of Youthâ€�, there was an endless search for â€œInvolved and Supportive Manager.â€� The desire to progress in oneâ€™s career is perfectly natural, even a positive signal. And yet, so many workplaces do not have that process built into their management structure.

Traditionally, corporate America assigns managerial and leadership positions to those who have advanced degrees (preferably Ph.D.â€™s) and/or have attended top tier schools. Rarely are they assessed on their management, leadership or communication expertise. And yet, it is these skills that make a formidable and impactful leader. Companies do not consider allocating these positions to managers who have the requisite â€œpeople skills.â€� There are a few ways that companies can address this paucity of skills:

Train managers â€“> not easy
Hire technical managers with good people managing and support skillset â€“> not easy
Create a position for managers to actually manage, that is non-technical. Have 2 managers that can fulfill needs for technical and career support and advising.

Given the high cost of turnover, consider that this may actually be a cost-benefit to the company in retaining employees.

 

### Actionable Advice for Those Seeking Mentors

 There are a plethora of articles out there about why mentorship is important, but a dearth of resources that delve deeper into successfully obtaining a mentor. Until you find an official mentor, here is some advice.

 

### Look broadly for a mentor

 It may seems like someone who is highly visible is a good person to ask, but imagine how busy they are. Ask someone who is more available.

 

### Test the waters

 Some people are interested in mentoring, and others are on the verge of burnout. Find the right person.

 

### Time is a Commodity

 Time is an irreplaceable commodity. Valuing other peopleâ€™s time is an effective way to give and earn respect.

 

### Make SMART requests

 SMART requests are:

**S**pecific
**M**eaningful (why you need it)
**A**ction-oriented (ask for something to be done)
**R**eal (authentic, not made up)
**T**ime-bound (when you need it)

 

### Asking questions

 Do not ask questions that are easily found via a Google search.

A potential and effective â€œmentorâ€� will evaluate a request with the following criteria (from Adam Grant):

> Can I offer something of unique value to this person that will take me 5 minutes or less?â€� [low cost / high benefit â€”> win / win]

 

### Be open to feedback and advice

 Do not ask for assistance and then ignore the recommendations that are offered.

 

### Reciprocity

 Just like any relationship, the ones that work best are two-way. Find out what the need is on the other side and offer that.

> Remember that reciprocity is a two-way street. Giving and taking are essential for individual success and positive cultures.

Offer something of value in return. Ask what you can do first before making a request.

 

### Manage your expectations

 You will still have to do the hard work. Give up the idea of a â€œPrince Charmingâ€� who will step in, solve all problems and offer the perfect career opportunity. It is a fantasy, not reality.

**Adam Grant**

> Role models seem out of reach if you only see them at their peak. To make them relatable, rewind the clock. What looked like natural talent is revealed as hard-earned skill. Study the trials and tribulations that testedâ€”and shapedâ€”their character.

 

### My Story on Mentorship

 To share, I have never asked anyone to be my mentor. I have no official mentor. And yet, I feel abundandance with the resources available to me.

This is my advice:

 

### Think Differently About Who a Mentor Could Be

 You do not have to have a formal relationship with someone for them to be a mentor. They can be people you see (on tv, at conferences, YouTube) or people whose work you read.

I have not yet met or spoken to Jeremy Howard. Yet, I observed how he involved the community in contributing to fastai open source by his video lectures. Last fall, when I was feeling overwhelmed with the WiMLDS meetup group as all 3 of my co-organizers were on maternity leave, it occurred to me that I could reach out to the WiMLDS community to get assistance for the events. I learned from Jeremy without ever meeting him or speaking with him.

 

### Something to be Learned from Negative Role Models

 If you see behavior by someone which is not appealing, that is also educational. We cannot control the behavior of others. *But*, we can observe it and learn not to behave that way.

One of my previous supervisors exhibited these traits:

Lack of communication
Treating people unfairly, playing favorites
Being unavailable. On the rare occasions I saw her at work, she began every conversation with â€œI am so busy, I am so overwhelmed at workâ€¦.â€� That does not invite any fruitful discussion.

With my meetup co-organziers, whom I have been mentoring for the past year, I have adopted the following behavior:

Be available and invite questions and discussion
Communicate regularly
Treat all individuals on the team fairly; when a team functions well, it is because the leadership creates the environment where everyone feels supported and respected, rather than playing favorites and politics.
Check in regularly and ask:How are things going? What is working well, what is not, and what can I help with?â€�
Offer constructive feedback
Explain decisions, the rationale, possible outcomes
Communicate when I am away and unavailable by either emailing or blocking out my time away on a shared calendar

 

### Think Outside of Data Science: â€œTransfer Mentorshipâ€�

 A mentor does not have to be in data science. One of my key confidants is a college friend who works in government, hundreds of miles away from me, doing non-quantitative work. I often share workplace dilemnas with her via phone calls and her perspectives are insightful and useful.

Just as in transfer learning where we transfer knowledge from one machine learning task to another application, we can do the same with mentoring expertise.

 

### Think All Genders

 Men, women and gender minorities all offer uniquely valuable perspectives and a diversity of opinions.

 

### Think All Interaction

 Anytime I interact with someone and I learn something, anything, from them, that is mentorship. And the reverse holds true as well.

 

### Read and Read More

 These are all books that I have read and re-read. I have physical copies of these books which are on my bookshelf, and which I often reference:

Power, by Jeffrey Pfeffer
Crucial Conversations; Tools for Talking When the Stakes are - High, Patterson, Grenny et al
Micro Messaging, Stephen Young
Getting Things Done, David Allen
Your Job Survival Guide: A Manual for Thriving in Change, Gregory Shea
How Google Works, Eric Schmidt & Jonathan Rosenberg
Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg

 

### Observe

 You can learn quite a bit from observation. When you observe someone, whether on stage, in conversation, on video, in writing, observe what is appealing about that person and emulate it. Look at how they conduct themselves. Ask yourself:

What do I admire about them?
What do they do well?
How do they interact with others? In person, in writing, on social media?

That is available to all of us without requesting a coffee meeting.

 

### Embrace (Negative) Feedback

 While it can be instinctive to be defensive with negative feedback, recognize that it can also be a powerful form of mentorship. We do not have to agree with all feedback, but we can consider it and give it some space.

 

### Put Some Effort Into It

 People reach out via email, LinkedIn, Twitter and Slack because it is so easy:

low effort
low risk
thus, low return

Research what areas the person works in and see if there is something in common where a reciprocal relationship can be established.

 

### Open Sourcing Mentorship?

 There has been discussion in data science community organizations about offering mentorship programs. However, all of these organizations are operated primarily by volunteers who are already overworked and in high demand. They include meetup organizers, conference organizers, open source contributors, educators and more. It is recognized that there is a demand in the data science community for mentorship. But, the problem with open source is that it is not really free. They are products and services that are primarily created and maintained by volunteers. There is a challenge in obtaining funding by corporations and donations by users. So, if a Mentorship Program is offered, for free, someone is dedicating hours of their personal time for that.

Conferences (such as PyData, PyCon, NeurIPS, ICML, SciPy and others) are primarily organized by volunteers. If they were organized by a commercial organization, the registration prices would be exhorbitant and inaccessible to the majority of attendees.

Personally, I think that offering mentoring services by the data science community would be unsustainable.

 

### Get Involved in the Community / Volunteer

 People can interact with experienced people by becoming more involved in the data science communities:

help at meetups
review conference proposals
volunteer at conferences
ask busy people what they need help with and offer to do those tasks
contribute constructively to social media discussions in data science

 

### My Mentees

 As an organizer for two meetup groups in the bustling city of New York, I can use all the help I can get. For the past year, I have mentored 4 women:

The bonus for me is that I am able to obtain desperately needed help to effectively run these meetup groups. For the 4 women, they receive mentorship from me on communicating with companies, organizing events, dealing with last minute crises, strategically planning for the future and more.

I have asked all of them to add new volunteers to our committees and mentor them through the process so that there is a good pipeline of organizers so the community can benefit from regular meetup events. It has been a mutually beneficial relationship.

 

### Contact

 I encourage people to email me with questions: reshama at wimlds dot org. While I do not promise a response to every email, I do read them all and write blogs for the questions I receive over time.

 

### Coaching

 

 

 

### Mentorship Leads

 **Vicki Boykis, Data Science is Different Now**

> After fumbling on my own for a very long time, Iâ€™ve now been established in â€œdata scienceâ€� for the past 6 years, and, to serve as the mentor that I didnâ€™t have, Iâ€™ve been answering emails and having coffee meetings with people looking for advice to get into data science.

### On the Topic of Sponsorship

### Perspectives of Busy People

 

### Jeremy Howard, in fastai Lesson 10

 

> Youâ€™ve got to be a bit careful, right? Because sometimes I get messages from random people saying â€œIâ€™ve got lots of good ideas, can we have coffee?â€� I donâ€™t want toâ€¦ you know, I can have coffee in my office anytime, thank you. But itâ€™s very different to say, hey, I took your ideas and I wrote a paper and I did a bunch of experiments and I figured out how your code works. They added documentation to it. Should we submit this to a conference? You see what I mean? There is nothing to stop you doing amazing work and if you do amazing work that helps someone else, like in this case, ok, Iâ€™m happy that we have a paper. I donâ€™t particularly care about papers. But, I think itâ€™s cool that these ideas now have this rigorous study. Let me show you what he did.

 

### Cassie Kozyrkov

 

> If youâ€™re thinking about asking a stranger to mentor you, itâ€™s a bit like asking a stranger to marry you.


 

### Lisa Martinez of Google

 

> If youâ€™re in the room, add value.

 

### Bethany Crystal

 

> Like any meaningful relationship, mentorships are long-term, and loaded with mutual respect and benefits on both sides. They take time to cultivate and nurture.

 

### Tough Love from Becky Davis

 Becky Davis gives some blunt advice on mentorship in her article, Unable To Find The Right Mentor? Maybe Youâ€™re The Problem

**Do these**

Give before you get
Build a relationship
Commit to the process

**Donâ€™t do these**

Donâ€™t use the word â€œmentorâ€�
Donâ€™t ask a stranger
Donâ€™t ask to pick their brain over coffee
Donâ€™t ask for their blueprint, roadmap or strategies to success
Donâ€™t give the victim story
Donâ€™t quit

 

### Barron Hall on Mentorship

 

> Mentoring in a structured program is tough if the mentees donâ€™t take an active role by showing initiative and striving to grow.

> Finding time and commitment to the time is key to sustaining the mentorship relationship

> Itâ€™s painful to the mentor when they do listen and canâ€™t perform, or when they easily have potential but wonâ€™t listen. Itâ€™s painful when people want to mentor you for everything except the thing you actually need.

> I had another mentor before, but both of us did not really know what to do. The first session was great but then we were not able to maintain a contact, because I did not have specific aims for that particular interaction. Also, many people are ok with being mentors, but have no clue how to do it.

 

### Sheryl Sandberg Lean In | Chapter 5: â€œAre You My Mentor?â€�

 

> I realized that searching for a mentor has become the professional equivalent of waiting for Prince Charming

> The strongest relationships spring out of a real and often earned connection felt by both sides.

> Studies show that mentors select proteges based on performance and potential. Intuitively, people invest in those who stand out for their talent or who can really benefit from help.

> Mentors continue to invest when mentees use their time well and are truly open to feedback.

> Peers can also mentor and sponsor one another.
