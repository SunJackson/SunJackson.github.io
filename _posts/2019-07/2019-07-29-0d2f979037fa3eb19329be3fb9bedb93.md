**Lifelong GAN: Continual Learning for Conditional Image Generation**

Lifelong learning is challenging for deep neural networks due to their susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a trained network is not able to maintain its ability to accomplish previously learned tasks when it is trained to perform new tasks. We study the problem of lifelong learning for generative models, extending a trained network to new conditional generation tasks without forgetting previous tasks, while assuming access to the training data for the current task only. In contrast to state-of-the-art memory replay based approaches which are limited to label-conditioned image generation tasks, a more generic framework for continual learning of generative models under different conditional image generation settings is proposed in this paper. Lifelong GAN employs knowledge distillation to transfer learned knowledge from previous networks to the new network. This makes it possible to perform image-conditioned generation tasks in a lifelong learning setting. We validate Lifelong GAN for both image-conditioned and label-conditioned generation tasks, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show the generality and effectiveness of our method.

**SciPy 1.0–Fundamental Algorithms for Scientific Computing in Python**

SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python programming language. SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years after the original version 0.1 release. SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language, with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per year. This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical developments.

**Efficient Detection and Quantification of Timing Leaks with Neural Networks**

Detection and quantification of information leaks through timing side channels are important to guarantee confidentiality. Although static analysis remains the prevalent approach for detecting timing side channels, it is computationally challenging for real-world applications. In addition, the detection techniques are usually restricted to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers. In practice, real-world applications may need to leak information about the secret. Therefore, quantification techniques are necessary to evaluate the resulting threats of information leaks. Since both problems are very difficult or impossible for static analysis techniques, we propose a dynamic analysis method. Our novel approach is to split the problem into two tasks. First, we learn a timing model of the program as a neural network. Second, we analyze the neural network to quantify information leaks. As demonstrated in our experiments, both of these tasks are feasible in practice — making the approach a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art side channel detectors and quantifiers. Our key technical contributions are (a) a neural network architecture that enables side channel discovery and (b) an MILP-based algorithm to estimate the side-channel strength. On a set of micro-benchmarks and real-world applications, we show that neural network models learn timing behaviors of programs with thousands of methods. We also show that neural networks with thousands of neurons can be efficiently analyzed to detect and quantify information leaks through timing side channels.

**An Overview for Markov Decision Processes in Queues and Networks**

Markov decision processes (MDPs) in queues and networks have been an interesting topic in many practical areas since the 1960s. This paper provides a detailed overview on this topic and tracks the evolution of many basic results. Also, this paper summarizes several interesting directions in the future research. We hope that this overview can shed light to MDPs in queues and networks, and also to their extensive applications in various practical areas.

**Interpretable Classification of Time-Series Data using Efficient Enumerative Techniques**

Cyber-physical system applications such as autonomous vehicles, wearable devices, and avionic systems generate a large volume of time-series data. Designers often look for tools to help classify and categorize the data. Traditional machine learning techniques for time-series data offer several solutions to solve these problems; however, the artifacts trained by these algorithms often lack interpretability. On the other hand, temporal logics, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) have been successfully used in the formal methods community as specifications of time-series behaviors. In this work, we propose a new technique to automatically learn temporal logic formulae that are able to cluster and classify real-valued time-series data. Previous work on learning STL formulas from data either assumes a formula-template to be given by the user, or assumes some special fragment of STL that enables exploring the formula structure in a systematic fashion. In our technique, we relax these assumptions, and provide a way to systematically explore the space of all STL formulas. As the space of all STL formulas is very large, and contains many semantically equivalent formulas, we suggest a technique to heuristically prune the space of formulas considered. Finally, we illustrate our technique on various case studies from the automotive, transportation and healthcare domain.

**Backward-Forward Algorithm: An Improvement towards Extreme Learning Machine**

Extreme learning machine (ELM), a randomized learning paradigm for a single hidden layer feed-forward network, has gained significant attention for solving problems in diverse domains due to its faster learning ability. The output weights in ELM are determined by an analytic procedure, while the input weights and biases are randomly generated and fixed during the training phase. The learning performance of ELM is highly sensitive to many factors such as the number of nodes in the hidden layer, the initialization of input weight and the type of activation functions in the hidden layer. Moreover, the performance of ELM is affected due to the presence of random input weight and the model suffers from ill posed problem. Hence, here we propose a backward-forward algorithm for a single feed-forward neural network that improves the generalization capability of the network with fewer hidden nodes. Here, both input and output weights are determined mathematically which gives the network its performance advantages. The proposed model provides an improvement over extreme learning machine with respect to the number of nodes used for generalization.

**Fairness in Reinforcement Learning**

Decision support systems (e.g., for ecological conservation) and autonomous systems (e.g., adaptive controllers in smart cities) start to be deployed in real applications. Although their operations often impact many users or stakeholders, no fairness consideration is generally taken into account in their design, which could lead to completely unfair outcomes for some users or stakeholders. To tackle this issue, we advocate for the use of social welfare functions that encode fairness and present this general novel problem in the context of (deep) reinforcement learning, although it could possibly be extended to other machine learning tasks.

**Towards Logical Specification of Statistical Machine Learning**

We introduce a logical approach to formalizing statistical properties of machine learning. Specifically, we propose a formal model for statistical classification based on a Kripke model, and formalize various notions of classification performance, robustness, and fairness of classifiers by using epistemic logic. Then we show some relationships among properties of classifiers and those between classification performance and robustness, which suggests robustness-related properties that have not been formalized in the literature as far as we know. To formalize fairness properties, we define a notion of counterfactual knowledge and show techniques to formalize conditional indistinguishability by using counterfactual epistemic operators. As far as we know, this is the first work that uses logical formulas to express statistical properties of machine learning, and that provides epistemic (resp. counterfactually epistemic) views on robustness (resp. fairness) of classifiers.

**Anti-unification in Constraint Logic Programming**

Anti-unification refers to the process of generalizing two (or more) goals into a single, more general, goal that captures some of the structure that is common to all initial goals. In general one is typically interested in computing what is often called a most specific generalization, that is a generalization that captures a maximal amount of shared structure. In this work we address the problem of anti-unification in CLP, where goals can be seen as unordered sets of atoms and/or constraints. We show that while the concept of a most specific generalization can easily be defined in this context, computing it becomes an NP-complete problem. We subsequently introduce a generalization algorithm that computes a well-defined abstraction whose computation can be bound to a polynomial execution time. Initial experiments show that even a naive implementation of our algorithm produces acceptable generalizations in an efficient way. Under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

**Classified Regression for Bayesian Optimization: Robot Learning with Unknown Penalties**

Learning robot controllers by minimizing a black-box objective cost using Bayesian optimization (BO) can be time-consuming and challenging. It is very often the case that some roll-outs result in failure behaviors, causing premature experiment detention. In such cases, the designer is forced to decide on heuristic cost penalties because the acquired data is often scarce, or not comparable with that of the stable policies. To overcome this, we propose a Bayesian model that captures exactly what we know about the cost of unstable controllers prior to data collection: Nothing, except that it should be a somewhat large number. The resulting Bayesian model, approximated with a Gaussian process, predicts high cost values in regions where failures are likely to occur. In this way, the model guides the BO exploration toward regions of stability. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model in several illustrative and statistical synthetic benchmarks, and also in experiments on a real robotic platform. In addition, we propose and experimentally validate a new BO method to account for unknown constraints. Such method is an extension of Max-Value Entropy Search, a recent information-theoretic method, to solve unconstrained global optimization problems.

**Constrained K-means with General Pairwise and Cardinality Constraints**

In this work, we study constrained clustering, where constraints are utilized to guide the clustering process. In existing works, two categories of constraints have been widely explored, namely pairwise and cardinality constraints. Pairwise constraints enforce the cluster labels of two instances to be the same (must-link constraints) or different (cannot-link constraints). Cardinality constraints encourage cluster sizes to satisfy a user-specified distribution. However, most existing constrained clustering models can only utilize one category of constraints at a time. In this paper, we enforce the above two categories into a unified clustering model starting with the integer program formulation of the standard K-means. As these two categories provide useful information at different levels, utilizing both of them is expected to allow for better clustering performance. However, the optimization is difficult due to the binary and quadratic constraints in the proposed unified formulation. To alleviate this difficulty, we utilize two techniques: equivalently replacing the binary constraints by the intersection of two continuous constraints; the other is transforming the quadratic constraints into bi-linear constraints by introducing extra variables. Then we derive an equivalent continuous reformulation with simple constraints, which can be efficiently solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate: (1) when utilizing a single category of constraint, the proposed model is superior to or competitive with state-of-the-art constrained clustering models, and (2) when utilizing both categories of constraints jointly, the proposed model shows better performance than the case of the single category.

**A Nonlinear Perron-Frobenius Approach for Stability and Consensus of Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems**

In this paper we propose a novel method to establish stability and, in addition, convergence to a consensus state for a class of discrete-time Multi-Agent System (MAS) evolving according to nonlinear heterogeneous local interaction rules which is not based on Lyapunov function arguments. In particular, we focus on a class of discrete-time MASs whose global dynamics can be represented by sub-homogeneous and order-preserving nonlinear maps. This paper directly generalizes results for sub-homogeneous and order-preserving linear maps which are shown to be the counterpart to stochastic matrices thanks to nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. We provide sufficient conditions on the structure of local interaction rules among agents to establish convergence to a fixed point and study the consensus problem in this generalized framework as a particular case. Examples to show the effectiveness of the method are provided to corroborate the theoretical analysis.

**The sameAs Problem: A Survey on Identity Management in the Web of Data**

In a decentralised knowledge representation system such as the Web of Data, it is common and indeed desirable for different knowledge graphs to overlap. Whenever multiple names are used to denote the same thing, owl:sameAs statements are needed in order to link the data and foster reuse. Whilst the deductive value of such identity statements can be extremely useful in enhancing various knowledge-based systems, incorrect use of identity can have wide-ranging effects in a global knowledge space like the Web of Data. With several works already proven that identity in the Web is broken, this survey investigates the current state of this ‘sameAs problem’. An open discussion highlights the main weaknesses suffered by solutions in the literature, and draws open challenges to be faced in the future.

**SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting Spans**

We present SpanBERT, a pre-training method that is designed to better represent and predict spans of text. Our approach extends BERT by (1) masking contiguous random spans, rather than random tokens, and (2) training the span boundary representations to predict the entire content of the masked span, without relying on the individual token representations within it. SpanBERT consistently outperforms BERT and our better-tuned baselines, with substantial gains on span selection tasks such as question answering and coreference resolution. In particular, with the same training data and model size as BERT-large, our single model obtains 94.6% and 88.7% F1 on SQuAD 1.1 and 2.0, respectively. We also achieve a new state of the art on the OntoNotes coreference resolution task (79.6% F1) and the TACRED relation extraction benchmark (70.8% F1), and even show gains on GLUE.

**Robust and Communication-Efficient Collaborative Learning**

We consider a decentralized learning problem, where a set of computing nodes aim at solving a non-convex optimization problem collaboratively. It is well-known that decentralized optimization schemes face two major system bottlenecks: stragglers’ delay and communication overhead. In this paper, we tackle these bottlenecks by proposing a novel decentralized and gradient-based optimization algorithm named as QuanTimed-DSGD. Our algorithm stands on two main ideas: (i) we impose a deadline on the local gradient computations of each node at each iteration of the algorithm, and (ii) the nodes exchange quantized versions of their local models. The first idea robustifies to straggling nodes and the second alleviates communication efficiency. The key technical contribution of our work is to prove that with non-vanishing noises for quantization and stochastic gradients, the proposed method exactly converges to the global optimal for convex loss functions, and finds a first-order stationary point in non-convex scenarios. Our numerical evaluations of the QuanTimed-DSGD on training benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate speedups of up to 3x in run-time, compared to state-of-the-art decentralized optimization methods.

**A Fine-Grained Spectral Perspective on Neural Networks**

Are neural networks biased toward simple functions? Does depth always help learn more complex features? Is training the last layer of a network as good as training all layers? These questions seem unrelated at face value, but in this work we give all of them a common treatment from the spectral perspective. We will study the spectra of the *Conjugate Kernel*, CK, (also called the *Neural Network-Gaussian Process Kernel*), and the *Neural Tangent Kernel*, NTK. Roughly, the CK and the NTK tell us respectively ‘what a network looks like at initialization’and ‘what a network looks like during and after training.’ Their spectra then encode valuable information about the initial distribution and the training and generalization properties of neural networks. By analyzing the eigenvalues, we lend novel insights into the questions put forth at the beginning, and we verify these insights by extensive experiments of neural networks. We believe the computational tools we develop here for analyzing the spectra of CK and NTK serve as a solid foundation for future studies of deep neural networks. We have open-sourced the code for it and for generating the plots in this paper at github.com/thegregyang/NNspectra.
