**The Finite-Horizon Two-Armed Bandit Problem with Binary Responses: A Multidisciplinary Survey of the History, State of the Art, and Myths**

In this paper we consider the two-armed bandit problem, which often naturally appears per se or as a subproblem in some multi-armed generalizations, and serves as a starting point for introducing additional problem features. The consideration of binary responses is motivated by its widespread applicability and by being one of the most studied settings. We focus on the undiscounted finite-horizon objective, which is the most relevant in many applications. We make an attempt to unify the terminology as this is different across disciplines that have considered this problem, and present a unified model cast in the Markov decision process framework, with subject responses modelled using the Bernoulli distribution, and the corresponding Beta distribution for Bayesian updating. We give an extensive account of the history and state of the art of approaches from several disciplines, including design of experiments, Bayesian decision theory, naive designs, reinforcement learning, biostatistics, and combination designs. We evaluate these designs, together with a few newly proposed, accurately computationally (using a newly written package in Julia programming language by the author) in order to compare their performance. We show that conclusions are different for moderate horizons (typical in practice) than for small horizons (typical in academic literature reporting computational results). We further list and clarify a number of myths about this problem, e.g., we show that, computationally, much larger problems can be designed to Bayes-optimality than what is commonly believed.

**The Coming Age of Pervasive Data Processing**

Emerging Big Data analytics and machine learning applications require a significant amount of computational power. While there exists a plethora of large-scale data processing frameworks which thrive in handling the various complexities of data-intensive workloads, the ever-increasing demand of applications have made us reconsider the traditional ways of scaling (e.g., scale-out) and seek new opportunities for improving the performance. In order to prepare for an era where data collection and processing occur on a wide range of devices, from powerful HPC machines to small embedded devices, it is crucial to investigate and eliminate the potential sources of inefficiency in the current state of the art platforms. In this paper, we address the current and upcoming challenges of pervasive data processing and present directions for designing the next generation of large-scale data processing systems.

**Beneficial perturbation network for continual learning**

Sequential learning of multiple tasks in artificial neural networks using gradient descent leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereby previously learned knowledge is erased during learning of new, disjoint knowledge. Here, we propose a fundamentally new type of method – Beneficial Perturbation Network (BPN). We add task-dependent memory (biasing) units to allow the network to operate in different regimes for different tasks. We compute the most beneficial directions to train these units, in a manner inspired by recent work on adversarial examples. At test time, beneficial perturbations for a given task bias the network toward that task to overcome catastrophic forgetting. BPN is not only more parameter-efficient than network expansion methods, but also does not need to store any data from previous tasks, in contrast with episodic memory methods. Experiments on variants of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate strong performance of BPN when compared to the state-of-the-art.

**Parametric versus Semi and Nonparametric Regression Models**

Three types of regression models researchers need to be familiar with and know the requirements of each: parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric regression models. The type of modeling used is based on how much information are available about the form of the relationship between response variable and explanatory variables, and the random error distribution. In this article, differences between models, common methods of estimation, robust estimation, and applications are introduced. The R code for all the graphs and analyses presented here, in this article, is available in the Appendix.

**Generating User-friendly Explanations for Loan Denials using GANs**

Financial decisions impact our lives, and thus everyone from the regulator to the consumer is interested in fair, sound, and explainable decisions. There is increasing competitive desire and regulatory incentive to deploy AI mindfully within financial services. An important mechanism towards that end is to explain AI decisions to various stakeholders. State-of-the-art explainable AI systems mostly serve AI engineers and offer little to no value to business decision makers, customers, and other stakeholders. Towards addressing this gap, in this work we consider the scenario of explaining loan denials. We build the first-of-its-kind dataset that is representative of loan-applicant friendly explanations. We design a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can accommodate smaller datasets, to generate user-friendly textual explanations. We demonstrate how our system can also generate explanations serving different purposes: those that help educate the loan applicants, or help them take appropriate action towards a future approval.

**Datalog Materialisation in Distributed RDF Stores with Dynamic Data Exchange**

Several centralised RDF systems support datalog reasoning by precomputing and storing all logically implied triples using the wellknown seminaive algorithm. Large RDF datasets often exceed the capacity of centralised RDF systems, and a common solution is to distribute the datasets in a cluster of shared-nothing servers. While numerous distributed query answering techniques are known, distributed seminaive evaluation of arbitrary datalog rules is less understood. In fact, most distributed RDF stores either support no reasoning or can handle only limited datalog fragments. In this paper we extend the dynamic data exchange approach for distributed query answering by Potter et al. [12] to a reasoning algorithm that can handle arbitrary rules while preserving important properties such as nonrepetition of inferences. We also show empirically that our algorithm scales well to very large RDF datasets

**DLIME: A Deterministic Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations Approach for Computer-Aided Diagnosis Systems**

Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular technique used to increase the interpretability and explainability of black box Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. LIME typically generates an explanation for a single prediction by any ML model by learning a simpler interpretable model (e.g. linear classifier) around the prediction through generating simulated data around the instance by random perturbation, and obtaining feature importance through applying some form of feature selection. While LIME and similar local algorithms have gained popularity due to their simplicity, the random perturbation and feature selection methods result in ‘instability’ in the generated explanations, where for the same prediction, different explanations can be generated. This is a critical issue that can prevent deployment of LIME in a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, where stability is of utmost importance to earn the trust of medical professionals. In this paper, we propose a deterministic version of LIME. Instead of random perturbation, we utilize agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (HC) to group the training data together and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) to select the relevant cluster of the new instance that is being explained. After finding the relevant cluster, a linear model is trained over the selected cluster to generate the explanations. Experimental results on three different medical datasets show the superiority for Deterministic Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (DLIME), where we quantitatively determine the stability of DLIME compared to LIME utilizing the Jaccard similarity among multiple generated explanations.

**Sequential Neural Processes**

Neural processes combine the strengths of neural networks and Gaussian processes to achieve both flexible learning and fast prediction of stochastic processes. However, neural processes do not consider the temporal dependency structure of underlying processes and thus are limited in modeling a large class of problems with temporal structure. In this paper, we propose Sequential Neural Processes (SNP). By incorporating temporal state-transition model into neural processes, the proposed model extends the potential of neural processes to modeling dynamic stochastic processes. In applying SNP to dynamic 3D scene modeling, we also introduce the Temporal Generative Query Networks. To our knowledge, this is the first 4D model that can deal with temporal dynamics of 3D scenes. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods in dynamic (non-stationary) regression and 4D scene inference and rendering.

**Example-Driven Query Intent Discovery: Abductive Reasoning using Semantic Similarity**

Traditional relational data interfaces require precise structured queries over potentially complex schemas. These rigid data retrieval mechanisms pose hurdles for non-expert users, who typically lack language expertise and are unfamiliar with the details of the schema. Query by Example (QBE) methods offer an alternative mechanism: users provide examples of their intended query output and the QBE system needs to infer the intended query. However, these approaches focus on the structural similarity of the examples and ignore the richer context present in the data. As a result, they typically produce queries that are too general, and fail to capture the user’s intent effectively. In this paper, we present SQuID, a system that performs semantic similarity-aware query intent discovery. Our work makes the following contributions: (1) We design an end-to-end system that automatically formulates select-project-join queries in an open-world setting, with optional group-by aggregation and intersection operators; a much larger class than prior QBE techniques. (2) We express the problem of query intent discovery using a probabilistic abduction model, that infers a query as the most likely explanation of the provided examples. (3) We introduce the notion of an abduction-ready database, which precomputes semantic properties and related statistics, allowing SQuID to achieve real-time performance. (4) We present an extensive empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets, including user-intent case studies, demonstrating that SQuID is efficient and effective, and outperforms machine learning methods, as well as the state-of-the-art in the related query reverse engineering problem.

**TS-CHIEF: A Scalable and Accurate Forest Algorithm for Time Series Classification**

Time Series Classification (TSC) has seen enormous progress over the last two decades. HIVE-COTE (Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles) is the current state of the art in terms of classification accuracy. HIVE-COTE recognizes that time series are a specific data type for which the traditional attribute-value representation, used predominantly in machine learning, fails to provide a relevant representation. HIVE-COTE combines multiple types of classifiers: each extracting information about a specific aspect of a time series, be it in the time domain, frequency domain or summarization of intervals within the series. However, HIVE-COTE (and its predecessor, FLAT-COTE) is often infeasible to run on even modest amounts of data. For instance, training HIVE-COTE on a dataset with only 1,500 time series can require 8 days of CPU time. It has polynomial runtime w.r.t training set size, so this problem compounds as data quantity increases. We propose a novel TSC algorithm, TS-CHIEF, which is highly competitive to HIVE-COTE in accuracy, but requires only a fraction of the runtime. TS-CHIEF constructs an ensemble classifier that integrates the most effective embeddings of time series that research has developed in the last decade. It uses tree-structured classifiers to do so efficiently. We assess TS-CHIEF on 85 datasets of the UCR archive, where it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with scalability and efficiency. We demonstrate that TS-CHIEF can be trained on 130k time series in 2 days, a data quantity that is beyond the reach of any TSC algorithm with comparable accuracy.

**Semi-Supervised Learning with Self-Supervised Networks**

**Dynamic time series clustering via volatility change-points**

This note outlines a method for clustering time series based on a statistical model in which volatility shifts at unobserved change-points. The model accommodates some classical stylized features of returns and its relation to GARCH is discussed. Clustering is performed using a probability metric evaluated between posterior distributions of the most recent change-point associated with each series. This implies series are grouped together at a given time if there is evidence the most recent shifts in their respective volatilities were coincident or closely timed. The clustering method is dynamic, in that groupings may be updated in an online manner as data arrive. Numerical results are given analyzing daily returns of constituents of the S&P 500.

**Future of Computing is Boring (and that is exciting!) or How to get to Computing Nirvana in 20 years or less**

We see a trend where computing becomes a metered utility similar to how the electric grid evolved. Initially electricity was generated locally but economies of scale (and standardization) made it more efficient and economical to have utility companies managing the electric grid. Similar developments can be seen in computing where scientific grids paved the way for commercial cloud computing offerings. However, in our opinion, that evolution is far from finished and in this paper we bring forward the remaining challenges and propose a vision for the future of computing. In particular we focus on changes in cost of computing and high cost of human time in comparison that indicates that saving developer time is the most important for future of computing.

**BPM for the masses: empowering participants of Cognitive Business Processes**

Authoring, developing, monitoring, and analyzing business processes has requires both domain and IT expertise since Business Process Management tools and practices have focused on enterprise applications and not end users. There are trends, however, that can greatly lower the bar for users to author and analyze their own processes. One emerging trend is the attention on blockchains as a shared ledger for parties collaborating on a process. Transaction logs recorded in a standard schema and stored in the open significantly reduces the effort to monitor and apply advanced process analytics. A second trend is the rapid maturity of machine learning algorithms, in particular deep learning models, and their increasing use in enterprise applications. These cognitive technologies can be used to generate views and processes customized for an end user so they can modify them and incorporate best practices learned from other users’ processes.

**A Framework for Evaluating Agricultural Ontologies**

An ontology is a formal representation of domain knowledge, which can be interpreted by machines. In recent years, ontologies have become a major tool for domain knowledge representation and a core component of many knowledge management systems, decision support systems and other intelligent systems, inter alia, in the context of agriculture. A review of the existing literature on agricultural ontologies, however, reveals that most of the studies, which propose agricultural ontologies, are lacking an explicit evaluation procedure. This is undesired because without well-structured evaluation processes, it is difficult to consider the value of ontologies to research and practice. Moreover, it is difficult to rely on such ontologies and share them on the Semantic Web or between semantic aware applications. With the growing number of ontology-based agricultural systems and the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web, it becomes essential that such development and evaluation methods are put forward to guide future efforts of ontology development. Our work contributes to the literature on agricultural ontologies, by presenting a method for evaluating agricultural ontologies, which seems to be missing from most existing studies on agricultural ontologies. The framework supports the matching of appropriate evaluation methods for a given ontology based on the ontology’s purpose.

**AMF: Aggregated Mondrian Forests for Online Learning**

Random Forests (RF) is one of the algorithms of choice in many supervised learning applications, be it classification or regression. The appeal of such methods comes from a combination of several characteristics: a remarkable accuracy in a variety of tasks, a small number of parameters to tune, robustness with respect to features scaling, a reasonable computational cost for training and prediction, and their suitability in high-dimensional settings. The most commonly used RF variants however are ‘offline’ algorithms, which require the availability of the whole dataset at once. In this paper, we introduce AMF, an online random forest algorithm based on Mondrian Forests. Using a variant of the Context Tree Weighting algorithm, we show that it is possible to efficiently perform an exact aggregation over all prunings of the trees; in particular, this enables to obtain a truly online parameter-free algorithm which is competitive with the optimal pruning of the Mondrian tree, and thus adaptive to the unknown regularity of the regression function. Numerical experiments show that AMF is competitive with respect to several strong baselines on a large number of datasets for multi-class classification.

**A Self-supervised Approach to Hierarchical Forecasting with Applications to Groupwise Synthetic Controls**

When forecasting time series with a hierarchical structure, the existing state of the art is to forecast each time series independently, and, in a post-treatment step, to reconcile the time series in a way that respects the hierarchy (Hyndman et al., 2011; Wickramasuriya et al., 2018). We propose a new loss function that can be incorporated into any maximum likelihood objective with hierarchical data, resulting in reconciled estimates with confidence intervals that correctly account for additional uncertainty due to imperfect reconciliation. We evaluate our method using a non-linear model and synthetic data on a counterfactual forecasting problem, where we have access to the ground truth and contemporaneous covariates, and show that we largely improve over the existing state-of-the-art method.

**Pyramid: A General Framework for Distributed Similarity Search**

Similarity search is a core component in various applications such as image matching, product recommendation and low-shot classification. However, single machine solutions are usually insufficient due to the large cardinality of modern datasets and stringent latency requirement of on-line query processing. We present Pyramid, a general and efficient framework for distributed similarity search. Pyramid supports search with popular similarity functions including Euclidean distance, angular distance and inner product. Different from existing distributed solutions that are based on KD-tree or locality sensitive hashing (LSH), Pyramid is based on Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph (HNSW), which is the state of the art similarity search algorithm on a single machine. To achieve high query processing throughput, Pyramid partitions a dataset into sub-datasets containing similar items for index building and assigns a query to only some of the sub-datasets for query processing. To provide the robustness required by production deployment, Pyramid also supports failure recovery and straggler mitigation. Pyramid offers a set of concise API such that users can easily use Pyramid without knowing the details of distributed execution. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that Pyramid produces quality results for similarity search, achieves high query processing throughput and is robust under node failure and straggler.

**Monte Carlo Gradient Estimation in Machine Learning**

This paper is a broad and accessible survey of the methods we have at our disposal for Monte Carlo gradient estimation in machine learning and across the statistical sciences: the problem of computing the gradient of an expectation of a function with respect to parameters defining the distribution that is integrated; the problem of sensitivity analysis. In machine learning research, this gradient problem lies at the core of many learning problems, in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. We will generally seek to rewrite such gradients in a form that allows for Monte Carlo estimation, allowing them to be easily and efficiently used and analysed. We explore three strategies–the pathwise, score function, and measure-valued gradient estimators–exploring their historical developments, derivation, and underlying assumptions. We describe their use in other fields, show how they are related and can be combined, and expand on their possible generalisations. Wherever Monte Carlo gradient estimators have been derived and deployed in the past, important advances have followed. A deeper and more widely-held understanding of this problem will lead to further advances, and it is these advances that we wish to support.

**ReachNN: Reachability Analysis of Neural-Network Controlled Systems**

Applying neural networks as controllers in dynamical systems has shown great promises. However, it is critical yet challenging to verify the safety of such control systems with neural-network controllers in the loop. Previous methods for verifying neural network controlled systems are limited to a few specific activation functions. In this work, we propose a new reachability analysis approach based on Bernstein polynomials that can verify neural-network controlled systems with a more general form of activation functions, i.e., as long as they ensure that the neural networks are Lipschitz continuous. Specifically, we consider abstracting feedforward neural networks with Bernstein polynomials for a small subset of inputs. To quantify the error introduced by abstraction, we provide both theoretical error bound estimation based on the theory of Bernstein polynomials and more practical sampling based error bound estimation, following a tight Lipschitz constant estimation approach based on forward reachability analysis. Compared with previous methods, our approach addresses a much broader set of neural networks, including heterogeneous neural networks that contain multiple types of activation functions. Experiment results on a variety of benchmarks show the effectiveness of our approach.

**Explaining Deep Learning Models with Constrained Adversarial Examples**

Machine learning algorithms generally suffer from a problem of explainability. Given a classification result from a model, it is typically hard to determine what caused the decision to be made, and to give an informative explanation. We explore a new method of generating counterfactual explanations, which instead of explaining why a particular classification was made explain how a different outcome can be achieved. This gives the recipients of the explanation a better way to understand the outcome, and provides an actionable suggestion. We show that the introduced method of Constrained Adversarial Examples (CADEX) can be used in real world applications, and yields explanations which incorporate business or domain constraints such as handling categorical attributes and range constraints.

**Learning Fair and Transferable Representations**

Developing learning methods which do not discriminate subgroups in the population is a central goal of algorithmic fairness. One way to reach this goal is by modifying the data representation in order to meet certain fairness constraints. In this work we measure fairness according to demographic parity. This requires the probability of the possible model decisions to be independent of the sensitive information. We argue that the goal of imposing demographic parity can be substantially facilitated within a multitask learning setting. We leverage task similarities by encouraging a shared fair representation across the tasks via low rank matrix factorization. We derive learning bounds establishing that the learned representation transfers well to novel tasks both in terms of prediction performance and fairness metrics. We present experiments on three real world datasets, showing that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.
