However, Masters degrees typically take 12 to 24 months, and in today's accelerated world many prospective Data Scientists wants to start sooner and are interested in Data Science/ML certificates which can be obtained in a few weeks.
Others have been working for a while but want a credential - a certification - to validate their knowledge of Analytics / Data Science. 


This blog presents the our survey of Top Certificates and Certifications in Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.
Note: All the hard work of data collection for this post was done by Dan Clark, and I added visualizations and introduction. All data was current when collected but all costs and other information is obviously subject to change.
We use 

Certification to refer to an assessment provided by a professional society, such as INFORMS, or a company, such as Microsoft. This generally certifies that a person has achieved a high level of professional knowledge. Some companies call their certificates "certifications" but we included them with other certificates in Tables 2a and 2b below.


A Certificate is usually provided a college or another educational institution upon a completion of a course or a set of courses.
