Listening to podcasts during your daily commute or while taking a break from the bustle of your day is an efficient and effective way to stay current on the field of data science and make sure you are always learning more.

The following *KDnuggets Top 10 list* highlights the most active and popular podcasts so far in 2019 that feature data science and machine learning conversations. We reviewed many more podcasts, so this list drills down to only those published on iTunes with the highest ratings (4.5+), the most reviews, and at least one recent episode within the current month. All show descriptions are adapted from the podcast listing.

We also share a few new and notable podcasts that are either too fresh for competing with the big list, haven’t published in a while but are still an excellent resource, or cover broader topics.  You should still consider checking out these shows as they might bring you just the tidbit of knowledge that will lead you to your next big data adventure!

Let us know what you think about our selections and please share your favorite podcasts you believe should be considered in a future best-of list.

### **The Top 10 in Podcasts**

 

**#1.**The Data Skeptic from Kyle Polich | 276 episodes, 2014 – 2019, iTunes

**#4.** Linear Digressions from Udacity | 237 episodes, 2014 – 2019, iTunes

An exploration of machine learning and data science through interesting (and often very unusual) applications.

Latest episode: (16 min.) If you’re Google or Netflix, and you have a recommendation or search system as part of your bread and butter, what’s the best way to test improvements to your algorithm? A/B testing is the canonical answer for testing how users respond to software changes, but it gets tricky fast to think about what an A/B test means in the context of an algorithm that returns a ranked list. That’s why we’re talking about interleaving this week—it’s a simple modification to A/B testing that makes it much easier to race two algorithms against each other and find the winner, and it allows you to do it with much less data than a traditional A/B test.

 

**#5.** TWiML&AI from Sam Charrington | 300 episodes, 2016 – 2019, iTunes

**#9.**The Digital Analytics Power Hour from Michael Helbling, Tim Wilson, and Moe Kiss | 126 episodes, 2015 – 2019, iTunes

Attend any conference, and you will hear people say that the most informative discussions happened in the bar after the show. Read any business magazine, and you will find an article saying something along the lines of "Business Analytics is the hottest job category out there, and there is a significant lack of people, process and best practice." In this case, the conference was eMetrics, the bar was… multiple, and the attendees were Michael Helbling, Tim Wilson, and Jim Cain (Co-host Emeritus). After a few pints and a few hours of discussion about the cutting edge of digital analytics, they realized they might have something to contribute back to the community. This podcast is one of those contributions. Each episode is a closed topic and an open forum - the goal is for listeners to enjoy listening to Michael, Tim, and Moe share their thoughts and experiences and hopefully take away something to try at work the next day.

Latest episode: (45 min.) Have you ever thought it would be a great idea to have a drink or two, grab a microphone, and then air your grievances in a public forum? Well, we did! This episode of the show was recorded in front of a live audience (No laugh tracks! No canned applause!) at the Marketing Analytics Summit (MAS) in Las Vegas. Moe, Michael, and Tim used a “What Grinds Our Gears?” application to discuss a range of challenges and frustrations that analysts face. They (well, Moe and Tim, of course) disagreed on a few of them, but they occasionally even proposed some ways to address the challenges, too.

 

**#10.** Artificial Intelligence in Industry from Daniel Faggella | 99 episodes, 2017 – 2019, iTunes

Learn what's possible - and what's working - with artificial intelligence in the enterprise through interviews with top AI and machine learning-focused executives and researchers in sectors like Pharma, Banking, Retail, and Defense. Discover trends, learn about what's working now, and learn how to adapt and thrive in an era of AI disruption.

Latest episode: (21 min.) When we polled our audience about what they were interested in, the most selected response was "business intelligence." As a follow-up, we asked them what business intelligence meant to them, and their responses boiled down to anything about understanding the data businesses are already collecting. That kind of broad definition gets to the heart of the confusion surrounding the differences between business intelligence and artificial intelligence. The line is starting to get blurry. Our guest this week is Elif Tutuk, Senior Director at Qlik. Tutuk talks about how business intelligence is evolving and how we might define it now that a lot of BI is becoming AI. Tutuk discusses where AI is making its way into business intelligence and what that might enable for businesses.
