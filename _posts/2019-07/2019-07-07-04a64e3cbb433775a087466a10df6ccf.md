Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t had as much time to make blog postsin the past year or so.I started taking classes as part ofGeorgia Techâ€™s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA)program last summer (2018) while continuing to work full-time, so extra timeto code and write hasnâ€™t been abundant for me.

Anyways, I figured I would share one neat thing I learnedas a consequence of taking classesâ€”writing compactâ€œcheat sheetsâ€�with `{rmarkdown}`. 

Writing with `{rmarkdown}` is fairly straightforwardâ€”mostlythanks to an abundance of freely available learning resources, like the***R Markdown: The Definitive Guide***â€”and usingCSS to customize your Rmarkdown output to your likingis not too difficult either.(By the way, huge shout-out to Yihui Xieand everyone else who has contributedto the development of the `{rmarkdown}` package.)My objective was to make an **extremely** compact PDFthat minimizes all white space .Despite my knowledge of CSS,I had a hard time getting an output that I liked purely from CSS,so I looked online to see if I could find some good LaTex templates.(After all, I would be knitting the Rmarkdown document to PDF,and LaTex would be incorporatedvia the equations on the cheat sheet.)Some templates I found worked fine but werenâ€™t completely to my liking. 

In my search for an â€œidealâ€� template, I stumbled upon a small tidbitin the very last portion of thePDF chapter of the ***R Markdown*** bookstating â€œYou can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the template optionâ€�. ğŸ¤”

At first, I was a bit intimidated by the idea of writing my own template.(â€œI have to write my own template from scratchusing a framework (LaTeX) that Iâ€™ve hardly even touched before now! ğŸ˜¨â€�)But alas, the task became less intimidating when I realized thatI could use the tried-and-true method of copying-pasting-modifyingfrom Stack Overflow!

## The Template

Using the template fromthis Stack Overflow post as a basis, I endedup creating a relatively minimal template.For the curious reader, see this GitHub repo,for the latest version of my template. It also includes an example cheat sheet.

The â€œgistâ€� of my template is shown below.

```
% Packages and preamble
% ...

\begin{document}

\begin{multicols*}{4}

$body$

\end{multicols*}

\end{document}

```

The key for me was to understand how pandoc variableslike `$body$` are used as placeholders for user-supplied content.(I know I havenâ€™t mentioned pandoc up to this point,but suffice it to say thatitâ€”along with the R package `{knitr}`â€”are what power the `{rmarkdown}` package.)

The `multicols` command shown in the snippet above is also noteworthy. ThisLaTex command provides the functionality for I wanted most for mycheat sheetâ€”multiple columns of content!I should point out that there are `in_header`, `before_body`, and `after_body` YAML options for customizing PDF output with `{rmarkdown}`. 

These options are probably sufficient for most peopleâ€™s customization needs(so using a custom template would not be necessary).But for me personally, the appeal of having â€œcompleteâ€� controlof my output by using a template convinced me to forego these options. 

## Usage

So, exactly how do you use a custom template with `{rmarkdown}`?Itâ€™s as simple as specifying the path to your template file with the `template`option in the YAML header of your Rmarkdown document. 

o an alternative LaTex engine with `latex_engine`.

```

output:
 pdf_document:
 includes:
 template: {/path/to/template.tex}

```

## Why This Way?

Before I was using Rstudio and `{rmarkdown}` to write my cheat sheets,I tried out a couple of LaTex editors .First, I tried the very popular Overleaf.It is well known and commonly used becauseit is web-based, allows the user to collaborate in real-time, andprovides real-time previewing .However, there was just something that felt â€œclunkyâ€� about the editor, andthe ambiguity over package versions and usage was bothersome to me. The other editor I tried for some time was TeXworks(with the pdftex distribution)Using the â€œTypsetâ€� command to generate my PDF output on an ad-hoc basis seemed to meto be a satisfactory workflow, but, among other things, I felt limited by the customizationoffered by TeXworks. 

And so I turned to Rstudio and `{rmarkdown}` and didnâ€™t look back.While learning how to create a custom template was a (minor) inconvenience,it has paid off in a number of ways:


I can use a familiar editorâ€”Rstudio.


I can use a familiar workflowâ€”writing in an Rmarkdown document and `knit`ting to create my desired output.


Because Iâ€™m using `{rmarkdown}`, I can use `{rmarkdown}` functionality that is not available when solely writing in LaTex.


This last point is huge.**The whole world of markdown syntax is valid!**For example,I can add emphasis to text with markdownâ€™s `**` and `__` tokens (instead of LaTexâ€™s more â€œverboseâ€� syntax);I can use `#` to define section headers (which I just think is super â€œelegantâ€�);and I can use HTML comments to comments out multiple lines of text.(Note that native LaTex only has a single-line comment tokenâ€”`%`. )Additionally, beyond just the markdown functionality, I can include `R` codethanks to added layer of functionality offered by `{rmarkdown}`.

The one big thing that I feel like I â€œsacrificedâ€� by moving to Rstudio and `{rmarkdown}`is the live preview feature that comes with Overleaf (and can be emulatedwith some configuration in other LaTex editors). Nonetheless, I feel like I geta reasonable facsimile of this feature with Rstudioâ€™s functionalityfor inline previews of equations. Below are examples of the preview capabilities for both single- andmulti-line equations.

##What Works for Me May Not Work For You

Although what Iâ€™ve described in this post has been working well for meâ€”andIâ€™d encourage others to try it outâ€”I donâ€™t claim itto be the â€œbestâ€� solution for all of your cheat sheet needs. If youâ€™ve got a workflow that works for you, thatâ€™s great! Keep using it!Be pragmatic.
