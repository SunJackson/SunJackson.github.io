This morning, digest version 0.6.20 went to CRAN, and I will send a package to Debian shortly as well.

digest creates hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the `md5`, `sha-1`, `sha-256`, `sha-512`, `crc32`, `xxhash32`, `xxhash64`, `murmur32`, and `spookyhash` algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects.

This version contains only internal changes with a switch to the (excellent) tinytest package. This now allows you, dear user of the package, to run `tinytest::test_package("digest")` at any point post-installation to reassure yourself that all standard assertions and tests are still met in *your* installation. No other changes were made.

CRANberries provides the usual summary of changes to the previous version.

For questions or comments use the issue tracker off the GitHub repo.
