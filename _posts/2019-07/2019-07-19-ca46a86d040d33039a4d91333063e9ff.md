You’ll have access to quality research, infrastructure and learning facilities, opportunities to collaborate internationally, as well as the grants you’ll need to publish your work. We’re a university full of energetic and enthusiastic minds, driven to challenge what’s expected, expand what we know, and learn from other inspiring, empowering thinkers.

**The Opportunity**

Monash University Faculty of IT currently has a requirement for **2 x Lecturer / Senior Lecturer **within the space of** Digital Health - Image Analytics**. 

Digital Health is a fascinating cross-university, cross-faculty, multidisciplinary space with enormous practical real-world and societal benefits that draws from and contributes to a multiplicity of research areas. 

As part of the work done, Monash University has a range of strategic partnerships, including the big 4 health organisations in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne; and with the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM), whose underlying philosophy is “learn from the dead to help the living”. In practice, this includes investigative forensic science as well as using advanced machine learning techniques and technologies to improve the performance and practices around imaging: X-Rays, CT scans, MRI etc. Image Analytics in this context is primarily concerned with using such advanced techniques to extract meaningful information from such imaging.

This enterprise at Monash is led by the inaugural Professor of Practice in Digital Health Chris Bain. Whilst he has extensive experience across medicine and healthcare, the position sits within the Faculty of IT, and is heavily focused on working in strategic partnerships with the disparate areas that make up the disciplinary whole. 

We are looking to talk to anyone who is interested in contributing to such a transformational field. Expertise in medical and healthcare is welcomed, but it is essential that there is primary proficiency around IT focused academia, demonstrated by such indicators as:

Papers
Contributions to highly-regarded IT academic journals
Demonstrated grant income
Citations
Other such academic KPI’s

These academic indicators should be focused around Information Technology.

The positions will operate within the space of Data Science and AI, and the successful candidates will be able to demonstrate a track record of both teaching and research within relevant fields.

This role is a full-time position; however, flexible working arrangements may be negotiated.At Monash University, we are committed to being a Child Safe organisation. This position at the University will require the incumbent to hold a valid Working with Children Check.
