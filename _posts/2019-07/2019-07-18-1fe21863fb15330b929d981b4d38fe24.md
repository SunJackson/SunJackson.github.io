Rewind to 2006 when Hans Rosling’s talk using moving bubbles was at peak attention. Researchers studied whether animation in visualization was a good thing. Danyel Fisher revisits their research a decade later. 

While they found that readers didn’t get much more accuracy from the movement versus other method, there was a big but:

> But we also found that users *really liked* the animation view: Study participants described it as “fun”, “exciting”, and even “emotionally touching.” At the same time, though, some participants found it confusing: “the dots flew everywhere.”
This is a dilemma. Do we make users *happy*, or do we help them be *effective*? After the novelty effect wears off, will we all wake up with an animation hangover and just want our graphs to stay still so we can read them?
