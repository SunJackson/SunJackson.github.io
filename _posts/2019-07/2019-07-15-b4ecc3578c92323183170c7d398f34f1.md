## Conference: Wednesday-Thursday, Jan 29-30

Join me, your host and Chief Scientist of RStudio, for our keynote speakers:

Along with 80 other talks in four parallel tracks.

As well as RStudio data scientists and engineers, you’ll also hear from and interact with outstanding speakers drawn from the wider R and data science communities. Stay tuned for announcements about our invited speakers, and our call for contributed talks.

Check out our videos from the last conference to get a sense of the depth and breadth of the typical content.

## Training days: Monday-Tuesday, Jan 27-28

Preceding the conference, RStudio will offer two days of optional in-person training. This year, we’ve expanded our training program to include 19 workshops taught by experts throughout the R community. These workshops span 3 categories of learning:

- Introductory: Workshops that require minimal or no R experience

- Intermediate/Advanced: Workshops that expand your existing R knowledge and focus on a specialized area of R

- Professional Development: Workshops focusing on professional skills that complement your R knowledge.


Your workshop choices this year include:

|**6 Introductory Workshops**|**Instructor(s)**
|------
|Designing The Data Science Classroom|Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel|
|Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse|Alison Hill & Garrett Grolemund|

|R for Excel Users|Julia Lowndes & Allison Horst|
|Shiny From Start To Finish|Danny Kaplan|

While we’ve expanded the number of workshop attendees we can accommodate by nearly 50%, RStudio::conf workshops are very popular and do sell out quickly. We encourage attendees who would like to attend workshops to register well in advance of the conference registration deadline.

## Who should go?

rstudio::conf is for RStudio users, R administrators, and RStudio partners who want to learn how to write better Shiny applications, explore all the capabilities of R Markdown, work effectively with Spark or TensorFlow, build predictive models, understand the tidyverse of tools for data science, build tidy tools themselves, discover production-ready development & deployment practices, earn certification as a trainer for Shiny or the Tidyverse, or become a certified administrator of RStudio professional products.

## Why do people go to rstudio::conf?

Because there is simply no better way to learn about all things R & RStudio.

After #rstudioconf, I shut my laptop for four days to decompress, marinateand spend some time with family. It’s back to work tomorrow and I couldn’tbe more excited to start coding again and *this feeling* is why I love theR community so much.— Caitlyn Hudon
Thing I learned at #Rstudioconf that sticks out to me the most: it turns outthat this group of people who are so kind and welcoming online are also kindand welcoming in real life. More than any library or api that’s what makes#rstats great.— Nick Strayer
Wrote a little poston why #rstudioconf is the best conference experience i have had. No kidding.I am on a high!— Athanasia Mowinckel
