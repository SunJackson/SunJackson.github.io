Online courses are a great way to share knowledge with others; that is why I have decided to launch a few courses. The first course is **Intro to Azure ML Studio – Regression**. This is a smaller course and should take about 2 hours to complete. 

Azure ML Studio is a drag-and-drop interface for doing machine learning. 

Topics are all based upon Azure ML Studio, and they include:
- Linear Regression
- Linear Correlation
- Feature Selection
- Splitting Data
- Evaluating a model

Use the code **BLOGREADER** to save 30%.
