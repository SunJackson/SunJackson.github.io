I recently wrote about the release of tidytext 0.2.1, and one of the most useful new features in this release is a couple of helper functions for making plots with ggplot2. These helper functions address a class of challenges that often arises when dealing with text data, so weâ€™ve included them in the tidytext package.

## Letâ€™s work through an example

To show how to use these new functions, letâ€™s walk through a more general example that does not deal with results that come from unstructured, free text. These helper functions are very often helpful in text analysis, but thatâ€™s not the only time I find myself reaching for them.

For this example, letâ€™s use the babynames dataset of names given to children in the US, and find which names were most common in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)

top_names <- babynames %>%
 filter(year >= 1950,
 year < 1990) %>%
 mutate(decade = (year %/% 10) * 10) %>%
 group_by(decade) %>%
 count(name, wt = n, sort = TRUE) %>%
 ungroup

top_names
```

```
## # A tibble: 100,527 x 3
## decade name n
## 
## 1 1950 James 846042
## 2 1950 Michael 839459
## 3 1960 Michael 836934
## 4 1950 Robert 832336
## 5 1950 John 799658
## 6 1950 David 771242
## 7 1960 David 736583
## 8 1960 John 716284
## 9 1970 Michael 712722
## 10 1960 James 687905
## # â€¦ with 100,517 more rows
```

Notice that we can already tell that some of the top names in these adjacent decades are the same (Michael, John, David) but are in different orders. Letâ€™s try to make a plot looking at these top names. What does the plot look like if we donâ€™t try to order the names at all?

```
top_names %>%
 group_by(decade) %>%
 top_n(15) %>%
 ungroup %>%
 mutate(decade = as.factor(decade)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(name, n, fill = decade)) +
 geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
 facet_wrap(~decade, scales = "free_y") +
 coord_flip() +
 scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 labs(y = "Number of babies per decade",
 x = NULL,
 title = "What were the most common baby names in each decade?",
 subtitle = "Via US Social Security Administration")
```

Here, ggplot2 puts the names in alphabetical order, because they are of type character. This isâ€¦ not so useful or pleasing, I think most people would agree. ğŸ˜© What if **instead** we order the names by `n`, the number of babies per decade?

```
top_names %>%
 group_by(decade) %>%
 top_n(15) %>%
 ungroup %>%
 mutate(decade = as.factor(decade),
 name = fct_reorder(name, n)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(name, n, fill = decade)) +
 geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
 facet_wrap(~decade, scales = "free_y") +
 coord_flip() +
 scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 labs(y = "Number of babies per decade",
 x = NULL,
 title = "What were the most common baby names in each decade?",
 subtitle = "Via US Social Security Administration")
```

Well, this **sort of** worked. ğŸ˜� **Mostly** worked, one might say. What `fct_reorder()` and the similar `reorder()` function from base R do is to reorder all of these together, not reorder these names individually within some category and keep track of that.

## Enter `reorder_within()`

Back in 2016, Tyler Rinker put together a solution for this problem, and David Robinson has had this wrapped up in some functions in his personal R package for a while now. Thanks to a PR from Tim Mastny, this functionality is now available in tidytext, as of version 0.2.1.

How does it work? We need to add *two* new functions.

```
library(tidytext)

top_names %>%
 group_by(decade) %>%
 top_n(15) %>%
 ungroup %>%
 mutate(decade = as.factor(decade),
 name = reorder_within(name, n, decade)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(name, n, fill = decade)) +
 geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
 facet_wrap(~decade, scales = "free_y") +
 coord_flip() +
 scale_x_reordered() +
 scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 labs(y = "Number of babies per decade",
 x = NULL,
 title = "What were the most common baby names in each decade?",
 subtitle = "Via US Social Security Administration")
```

Aaaaaaah, much better! ğŸ˜� Notice that first, we used `reorder_within()` with three arguments:

- the item we want to reorder

- what we want to reorder by

- the groups or categories we want to reorder within


Then we used `scale_x_reordered()` to finish up making this plot. This `scale()` function can take all the usual arguments you might want to pass along to such a thing in ggplot2, like `expand` or anything like that.

I use this approach whenever I have counts, tf-idf, or another quantity I want to plot across facets when there are overlapping values but I want each facet to display in rank order. Iâ€™m glad that these helper functions are now easily available in a package on CRAN, because I have found them quite helpful in my own day-to-day work.

It was interesting work to get this into tidytext and supported there, as it is the first function for plotting we have included. I got to learn about building some tests for ggplot2 objects, including how to test actual plots using vdiffr. I hope the results of that work are useful to lots of folks!
