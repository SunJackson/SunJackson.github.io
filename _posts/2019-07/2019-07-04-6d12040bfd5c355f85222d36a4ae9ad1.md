We are happy to announce the R package compareWith, providing user-friendly RStudio addins that simplify diff and merge tasks.



Just ahead of the upcoming useR!2019 Toulouse, where Miraier Nikki will be introducing the package in a short talk during one of the lightning sessions (Thursday morning – July 11), we are pleased to put this small utility out here, which has brought some noticeable enhancement to our day-to-day R development process over the past year.

Integration of version control tools in R and RStudio is still significantly behind what is desirable. With the uprise of GitHub and git for open-source R package development, issues are being tackled through separate branches and contributors are more numerous and heterogeneous. compareWith is a R package that allows users to interact with Meld from within RStudio through addins, making it easier to perform **diff** and **merge** tasks. Examples include:

- compare differences prior to commit, for single active files or the whole project;

- editing files or directories;

- resolve merge conflicts via three-way comparison.

#### Installation

You can install the latest **compareWith** from GitHub using the **remotes** package

```
remotes::install_github("miraisolutions/compareWith")

```

The required dependency Meld is available for most Linux/Unix distributions and can be easily installed there, e.g. via `sudo apt install meld` on **Debian/Ubuntu**.

On **Windows**, its installation is supported by an MSI installer, downloadable from the Meld website. We recommend using the **3.18.3** installer (as hinted on the website), since newer versions seem to have Gtk issues. After installation, you may have to add the location of the installed `meld.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable.

Meld is not yet officially supported on **MacOS**. However, pre-built binaries are available as `meldmerge.dmg` images for new and old releases of Meld. We currently recommend using Meld **3.16.0**, as newer versions do not appear to be stable. After installation, you need to make sure `meld` can be launched from the command line, e.g. via:

```
ln -s /Applications/Meld.app/Contents/MacOS/Meld /usr/local/bin/meld

```

Meld can also be installed via MacPorts, Fink or Brew, where you may also have to switch to an older stable version.

#### Usage

The functionality of compareWith is accessible in RStudio using the *Addins* menu or the command-line functions. Examples include:

- `compare_with_repo(path)` allows to track changes in file(s) under `path` (belonging to a version-control repository);

- `compare_active_file_with_other(location)` allows the user to compare the currently opened file with another (browsing from `location`).


In case Meld is not installed, the current version is not working properly, or `path` or `location` are not specified correctly, an error is displayed.
