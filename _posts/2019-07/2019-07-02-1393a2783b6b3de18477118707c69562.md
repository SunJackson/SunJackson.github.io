### **Introduction**

 Let’s agree for a moment that data is the new game changer in business strategy. 

But pause for a moment and think; if everybody has access to and makes use of the same data readily available on the Internet, how can anybody get a competitive edge?

Ready access to the traditional web data neutralizes its value as competitive advantage. 

This is why there’s a growing thrust on harnessing alternative data. 

Yes, alternative data is the new game changer. 

It’s data which is curated from a variety of non-traditional sources. Alternative data basically implies data that is created with the advent of connected devices, varied sensors, transactional systems, social networking sites and of course, the Internet.

Data derived from online browsing activity, satellite images, credit card transactions, social media posts etc. all fall under the category of alternative data. 

What matters here is how you can make use of alternative data derived from these different sources and leverage it to forge a competitive advantage and edge. 

To start with, you might even wonder from where you can get hold of alternative data that can give such a competitive advantage. 

No worries. 

We have put together an extensive list of alternative data sources that you can exploit to the fullest.

 

### **Alternative Data Sources: **

 **1. ****Sensors**

There’s a huge pool of alternative data which is getting created out there. The more you pay attention to these non-traditional sources, the more you are likely to acquire an advantage. For instance, with Internet of Things, you have a number of sources from where alternative data can be obtained. A host of sensors connected to all sorts of electronic devices keep churning out this data which can be accessed and processed from new insights. The more powerful these sensors are, the more they can provide real-time information in a much more efficient manner.
