In this script, we define a custom Dataset object that loads the MRNet data in the main program.

To create the dataset, we define a class called MRDataset that inherits from the class torch.utils.data.Dataset

In the constructor of MRDataset, we define a set of arguments:

- root_dir: ./data/

- task: either acl, meniscus or abnormal. we'll focus on **acl** in this post

- plane: either sagittal, coronal or axial

- train: a boolean variable that indicates whether we are processing train data or not (validation)

- transform: the series of data augmentation operations. If None, no data augmentation

- weights: custom weights for each class (default to None): this is used to adjust the loss function. When None, weights are computed automatically.


In the remaining part of the constructor, we prepare the paths, the labels, and the weights that correspond to each data sample.

In the __len__ function, we return the length of the data

In the __getitem__ function we return the MRI scan .npy file, the label and the weight after applying minor preprocessing and eventual data augmentation.
