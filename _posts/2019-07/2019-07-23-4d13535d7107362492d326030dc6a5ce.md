**Deciphering Dynamical Nonlinearities in Short Time Series Using Recurrent Neural Networks**

Surrogate testing techniques have been used widely to investigate the presence of dynamical nonlinearities, an essential ingredient of deterministic chaotic processes. Traditional surrogate testing subscribes to statistical hypothesis testing and investigates potential differences in discriminant statistics between the given empirical sample and its surrogate counterparts. The choice and estimation of the discriminant statistics can be challenging across short time series. Also, conclusion based on a single empirical sample is an inherent limitation. The present study proposes a recurrent neural network classification framework that uses the raw time series obviating the need for discriminant statistic while accommodating multiple time series realizations for enhanced generalizability of the findings. The results are demonstrated on short time series with lengths (L = 32, 64, 128) from continuous and discrete dynamical systems in chaotic regimes, nonlinear transform of linearly correlated noise and experimental data. Accuracy of the classifier is shown to be markedly higher than >> 50% for the processes in chaotic regimes whereas those of nonlinearly correlated noise were around ~50% similar to that of random guess from a one-sample binomial test. These results are promising and elucidate the usefulness of the proposed framework in identifying potential dynamical nonlinearities from short experimental time series.

This short piece defines a Markov basis. The aim is to introduce the statistical concept to mathematicians.

**MedCATTrainer: A Biomedical Free Text Annotation Interface with Active Learning and Research Use Case Specific Customisation**

We present MedCATTrainer an interface for building, improving and customising a given Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+L) model for biomedical domain text. NER+L is often used as a first step in deriving value from clinical text. Collecting labelled data for training models is difficult due to the need for specialist domain knowledge. MedCATTrainer offers an interactive web-interface to inspect and improve recognised entities from an underlying NER+L model via active learning. Secondary use of data for clinical research often has task and context specific criteria. MedCATTrainer provides a further interface to define and collect supervised learning training data for researcher specific use cases. Initial results suggest our approach allows for efficient and accurate collection of research use case specific training data.

**Fairness-enhancing interventions in stream classification**

The wide spread usage of automated data-driven decision support systems has raised a lot of concerns regarding accountability and fairness of the employed models in the absence of human supervision. Existing fairness-aware approaches tackle fairness as a batch learning problem and aim at learning a fair model which can then be applied to future instances of the problem. In many applications, however, the data comes sequentially and its characteristics might evolve with time. In such a setting, it is counter-intuitive to ‘fix’ a (fair) model over the data stream as changes in the data might incur changes in the underlying model therefore, affecting its fairness. In this work, we propose fairness-enhancing interventions that modify the input data so that the outcome of any stream classifier applied to that data will be fair. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our approach achieves good predictive performance and low discrimination scores over the course of the stream.

**DeepTrax: Embedding Graphs of Financial Transactions**

Financial transactions can be considered edges in a heterogeneous graph between entities sending money and entities receiving money. For financial institutions, such a graph is likely large (with millions or billions of edges) while also sparsely connected. It becomes challenging to apply machine learning to such large and sparse graphs. Graph representation learning seeks to embed the nodes of a graph into a Euclidean vector space such that graph topological properties are preserved after the transformation. In this paper, we present a novel application of representation learning to bipartite graphs of credit card transactions in order to learn embeddings of account and merchant entities. Our framework is inspired by popular approaches in graph embeddings and is trained on two internal transaction datasets. This approach yields highly effective embeddings, as quantified by link prediction AUC and F1 score. Further, the resulting entity vectors retain intuitive semantic similarity that is explored through visualizations and other qualitative analyses. Finally, we show how these embeddings can be used as features in downstream machine learning business applications such as fraud detection.

**Modeling Human Annotation Errors to Design Bias-Aware Systems for Social Stream Processing**

High-quality human annotations are necessary to create effective machine learning systems for social media. Low-quality human annotations indirectly contribute to the creation of inaccurate or biased learning systems. We show that human annotation quality is dependent on the ordering of instances shown to annotators (referred as ‘annotation schedule’), and can be improved by local changes in the instance ordering provided to the annotators, yielding a more accurate annotation of the data stream for efficient real-time social media analytics. We propose an error-mitigating active learning algorithm that is robust with respect to some cases of human errors when deciding an annotation schedule. We validate the human error model and evaluate the proposed algorithm against strong baselines by experimenting on classification tasks of relevant social media posts during crises. According to these experiments, considering the order in which data instances are presented to human annotators leads to both an increase in accuracy for machine learning and awareness toward some potential biases in human learning that may affect the automated classifier.

**FAHT: An Adaptive Fairness-aware Decision Tree Classifier**

Automated data-driven decision-making systems are ubiquitous across a wide spread of online as well as offline services. These systems, depend on sophisticated learning algorithms and available data, to optimize the service function for decision support assistance. However, there is a growing concern about the accountability and fairness of the employed models by the fact that often the available historic data is intrinsically discriminatory, i.e., the proportion of members sharing one or more sensitive attributes is higher than the proportion in the population as a whole when receiving positive classification, which leads to a lack of fairness in decision support system. A number of fairness-aware learning methods have been proposed to handle this concern. However, these methods tackle fairness as a static problem and do not take the evolution of the underlying stream population into consideration. In this paper, we introduce a learning mechanism to design a fair classifier for online stream based decision-making. Our learning model, FAHT (Fairness-Aware Hoeffding Tree), is an extension of the well-known Hoeffding Tree algorithm for decision tree induction over streams, that also accounts for fairness. Our experiments show that our algorithm is able to deal with discrimination in streaming environments, while maintaining a moderate predictive performance over the stream.

**Relevancy Classification of Multimodal Social Media Streams for Emergency Services**

Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. During time-critical events, the public shares a variety of posts on social media including reports for resource needs, damages, and help offerings for the affected community. Such posts can be relevant and may contain valuable situational awareness information. However, the information overload of social media challenges the timely processing and extraction of relevant information by the emergency services. Furthermore, the growing usage of multimedia content in the social media posts in recent years further adds to the challenge in timely mining relevant information from social media. In this paper, we present a novel method for multimodal relevancy classification of social media posts, where relevancy is defined with respect to the information needs of emergency management agencies. Specifically, we experiment with the combination of semantic textual features with the image features to efficiently classify a relevant multimodal social media post. We validate our method using an evaluation of classifying the data from three real-world crisis events. Our experiments demonstrate that features based on the proposed hybrid framework of exploiting both textual and image content improve the performance of identifying relevant posts. In the light of these experiments, the application of the proposed classification method could reduce cognitive load on emergency services, in filtering multimodal public posts at large scale.

**An Inductive Synthesis Framework for Verifiable Reinforcement Learning**

Despite the tremendous advances that have been made in the last decade on developing useful machine-learning applications, their wider adoption has been hindered by the lack of strong assurance guarantees that can be made about their behavior. In this paper, we consider how formal verification techniques developed for traditional software systems can be repurposed for verification of reinforcement learning-enabled ones, a particularly important class of machine learning systems. Rather than enforcing safety by examining and altering the structure of a complex neural network implementation, our technique uses blackbox methods to synthesizes deterministic programs, simpler, more interpretable, approximations of the network that can nonetheless guarantee desired safety properties are preserved, even when the network is deployed in unanticipated or previously unobserved environments. Our methodology frames the problem of neural network verification in terms of a counterexample and syntax-guided inductive synthesis procedure over these programs. The synthesis procedure searches for both a deterministic program and an inductive invariant over an infinite state transition system that represents a specification of an application’s control logic. Additional specifications defining environment-based constraints can also be provided to further refine the search space. Synthesized programs deployed in conjunction with a neural network implementation dynamically enforce safety conditions by monitoring and preventing potentially unsafe actions proposed by neural policies. Experimental results over a wide range of cyber-physical applications demonstrate that software-inspired formal verification techniques can be used to realize trustworthy reinforcement learning systems with low overhead.

**Towards Understanding Generalization in Gradient-Based Meta-Learning**

In this work we study generalization of neural networks in gradient-based meta-learning by analyzing various properties of the objective landscapes. We experimentally demonstrate that as meta-training progresses, the meta-test solutions, obtained after adapting the meta-train solution of the model, to new tasks via few steps of gradient-based fine-tuning, become flatter, lower in loss, and further away from the meta-train solution. We also show that those meta-test solutions become flatter even as generalization starts to degrade, thus providing an experimental evidence against the correlation between generalization and flat minima in the paradigm of gradient-based meta-leaning. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that generalization to new tasks is correlated with the coherence between their adaptation trajectories in parameter space, measured by the average cosine similarity between task-specific trajectory directions, starting from a same meta-train solution. We also show that coherence of meta-test gradients, measured by the average inner product between the task-specific gradient vectors evaluated at meta-train solution, is also correlated with generalization. Based on these observations, we propose a novel regularizer for MAML and provide experimental evidence for its effectiveness.

**Explaining Vulnerabilities to Adversarial Machine Learning through Visual Analytics**

Machine learning models are currently being deployed in a variety of real-world applications where model predictions are used to make decisions about healthcare, bank loans, and numerous other critical tasks. As the deployment of artificial intelligence technologies becomes ubiquitous, it is unsurprising that adversaries have begun developing methods to manipulate machine learning models to their advantage. While the visual analytics community has developed methods for opening the black box of machine learning models, little work has focused on helping the user understand their model vulnerabilities in the context of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring model vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Our framework employs a multi-faceted visualization scheme designed to support the analysis of data poisoning attacks from the perspective of models, data instances, features, and local structures. We demonstrate our framework through two case studies on binary classifiers and illustrate model vulnerabilities with respect to varying attack strategies.

**Dynamic optimization with side information**

We present a data-driven framework for incorporating side information in dynamic optimization under uncertainty. Specifically, our approach uses predictive machine learning methods (such as k-nearest neighbors, kernel regression, and random forests) to weight the relative importance of various data-driven uncertainty sets in a robust optimization formulation. Through a novel measure concentration result for local machine learning methods, we prove that the proposed framework is asymptotically optimal for stochastic dynamic optimization with covariates. We also describe a general-purpose approximation for the proposed framework, based on overlapping linear decision rules, which is computationally tractable and produces high-quality solutions for dynamic problems with many stages. Across a variety of examples in shipment planning, inventory management, and finance, our method achieves improvements of up to 15% over alternatives and requires less than one minute of computation time on problems with twelve stages.

**Half a Percent of Labels is Enough: Efficient Animal Detection in UAV Imagery using Deep CNNs and Active Learning**

We present an Active Learning (AL) strategy for re-using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based object detector on a new dataset. This is of particular interest for wildlife conservation: given a set of images acquired with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and manually labeled gound truth, our goal is to train an animal detector that can be re-used for repeated acquisitions, e.g. in follow-up years. Domain shifts between datasets typically prevent such a direct model application. We thus propose to bridge this gap using AL and introduce a new criterion called Transfer Sampling (TS). TS uses Optimal Transport to find corresponding regions between the source and the target datasets in the space of CNN activations. The CNN scores in the source dataset are used to rank the samples according to their likelihood of being animals, and this ranking is transferred to the target dataset. Unlike conventional AL criteria that exploit model uncertainty, TS focuses on very confident samples, thus allowing a quick retrieval of true positives in the target dataset, where positives are typically extremely rare and difficult to find by visual inspection. We extend TS with a new window cropping strategy that further accelerates sample retrieval. Our experiments show that with both strategies combined, less than half a percent of oracle-provided labels are enough to find almost 80% of the animals in challenging sets of UAV images, beating all baselines by a margin.

**A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Towards Medical XAI**

Recently, artificial intelligence, especially machine learning has demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning. Along with research progress, machine learning has encroached into many different fields and disciplines. Some of them, such as the medical field, require high level of accountability, and thus transparency, which means we need to be able to explain machine decisions, predictions and justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of the deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them, with the intention of providing alternative perspective that is hopefully more tractable for future adoption of interpretability standard. We explore further into interpretability in the medical field, illustrating the complexity of interpretability issue.

**Feature Selection via Mutual Information: New Theoretical Insights**

Mutual information has been successfully adopted in filter feature-selection methods to assess both the relevancy of a subset of features in predicting the target variable and the redundancy with respect to other variables. However, existing algorithms are mostly heuristic and do not offer any guarantee on the proposed solution. In this paper, we provide novel theoretical results showing that conditional mutual information naturally arises when bounding the ideal regression/classification errors achieved by different subsets of features. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel stopping condition for backward and forward greedy methods which ensures that the ideal prediction error using the selected feature subset remains bounded by a user-specified threshold. We provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical claims and compare to common heuristic methods.

**SUMBT: Slot-Utterance Matching for Universal and Scalable Belief Tracking**

In goal-oriented dialog systems, belief trackers estimate the probability distribution of slot-values at every dialog turn. Previous neural approaches have modeled domain- and slot-dependent belief trackers, and have difficulty in adding new slot-values, resulting in lack of flexibility of domain ontology configurations. In this paper, we propose a new approach to universal and scalable belief tracker, called slot-utterance matching belief tracker (SUMBT). The model learns the relations between domain-slot-types and slot-values appearing in utterances through attention mechanisms based on contextual semantic vectors. Furthermore, the model predicts slot-value labels in a non-parametric way. From our experiments on two dialog corpora, WOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ, the proposed model showed performance improvement in comparison with slot-dependent methods and achieved the state-of-the-art joint accuracy.

**Towards Blockchain-based Multi-Agent Robotic Systems: Analysis, Classification and Applications**

Decentralization, immutability and transparency make of Blockchain one of the most innovative technology of recent years. This paper presents an overview of solutions based on Blockchain technology for multi-agent robotic systems, and provide an analysis and classification of this emerging field. The reasons for implementing Blockchain in a multi-robot network may be to increase the interaction efficiency between agents by providing more trusted information exchange, reaching a consensus in trustless conditions, assessing robot productivity or detecting performance problems, identifying intruders, allocating plans and tasks, deploying distributed solutions and joint missions. Blockchain-based applications are discussed to demonstrate how distributed ledger can be used to extend the number of research platforms and libraries for multi-agent robotic systems.

**Photonic architecture for reinforcement learning**

The last decade has seen an unprecedented growth in artificial intelligence and photonic technologies, both of which drive the limits of modern-day computing devices. In line with these recent developments, this work brings together the state of the art of both fields within the framework of reinforcement learning. We present the blueprint for a photonic implementation of an active learning machine incorporating contemporary algorithms such as SARSA, Q-learning, and projective simulation. We numerically investigate its performance within typical reinforcement learning environments, showing that realistic levels of experimental noise can be tolerated or even be beneficial for the learning process. Remarkably, the architecture itself enables mechanisms of abstraction and generalization, two features which are often considered key ingredients for artificial intelligence. The proposed architecture, based on single-photon evolution on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters, is simple, scalable, and a first integration in portable systems appears to be within the reach of near-term technology.

**Low-Shot Classification: A Comparison of Classical and Deep Transfer Machine Learning Approaches**

Despite the recent success of deep transfer learning approaches in NLP, there is a lack of quantitative studies demonstrating the gains these models offer in low-shot text classification tasks over existing paradigms. Deep transfer learning approaches such as BERT and ULMFiT demonstrate that they can beat state-of-the-art results on larger datasets, however when one has only 100-1000 labelled examples per class, the choice of approach is less clear, with classical machine learning and deep transfer learning representing valid options. This paper compares the current best transfer learning approach with top classical machine learning approaches on a trinary sentiment classification task to assess the best paradigm. We find that BERT, representing the best of deep transfer learning, is the best performing approach, outperforming top classical machine learning algorithms by 9.7% on average when trained with 100 examples per class, narrowing to 1.8% at 1000 labels per class. We also show the robustness of deep transfer learning in moving across domains, where the maximum loss in accuracy is only 0.7% in similar domain tasks and 3.2% cross domain, compared to classical machine learning which loses up to 20.6%.

**Testing for Unobserved Heterogeneity via k-means Clustering**

Clustering methods such as k-means have found widespread use in a variety of applications. This paper proposes a formal testing procedure to determine whether a null hypothesis of a single cluster, indicating homogeneity of the data, can be rejected in favor of multiple clusters. The test is simple to implement, valid under relatively mild conditions (including non-normality, and heterogeneity of the data in aspects beyond those in the clustering analysis), and applicable in a range of contexts (including clustering when the time series dimension is small, or clustering on parameters other than the mean). We verify that the test has good size control in finite samples, and we illustrate the test in applications to clustering vehicle manufacturers and U.S. mutual funds.

**Robustness properties of Facebook’s ResNeXt WSL models**

We investigate the robustness properties of ResNeXt image recognition models trained with billion scale weakly-supervised data (ResNeXt WSL models). These models, recently made public by Facebook AI, were trained on ~1B images from Instagram and fine-tuned on ImageNet. We show that these models display an unprecedented degree of robustness against common image corruptions and perturbations, as measured by the ImageNet-C and ImageNet-P benchmarks. The largest of the released models, in particular, achieves state-of-the-art results on both ImageNet-C and ImageNet-P by a large margin. The gains on ImageNet-C and ImageNet-P far outpace the gains on ImageNet validation accuracy, suggesting the former as more useful benchmarks to measure further progress in image recognition. Remarkably, the ResNeXt WSL models even achieve a limited degree of adversarial robustness against state-of-the-art white-box attacks (10-step PGD attacks). However, in contrast to adversarially trained models, the robustness of the ResNeXt WSL models rapidly declines with the number of PGD steps, suggesting that these models do not achieve genuine adversarial robustness. Visualization of the learned features also confirms this conclusion. Finally, we show that although the ResNeXt WSL models are more shape-biased in their predictions than comparable ImageNet-trained models, they still remain much more texture-biased than humans.
