## Introduction

In a previous post,we had introduced our R package rfmbut did not go into the conceptual details of RFM analysis. In this post, wewill explore RFM in much more depth and work through a case study as well.**RFM** (Recency, Frequency & Monetary) analysis is a behavior based techniqueused to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as:

- how recently a customer has purchased?

- how often do they purchase?

- how much the customer spends?


It is based on the marketing axiom that **80% of your business comes from 20%of your customers**. RFM helps to identify customers who are more likely torespond to promotions by segmenting them into various categories.

## Case Study

We will work through a case study to better understand the underlying conceptsof RFM analysis. To pique your curiosity, we will start with the results orthe final outcome of the case study as shown below:

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segments.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segments.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


The table has the following details:

- name or id of the customer

- number of days since the last transaction of the customer

- number of transactions of the customer

- total value of the all the transactions of the customer

- RFM score

- customer segment


The rest of this post will focus on generating a similar result for our casestudy and along the way we will learn to:

- structure data for RFM analysis

- generate RFM score

- and segment customers using RFM score


## Applications

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_applications.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us talk about applications. Though largely identified with retail orecommerce, RFM analysis can be applied in a lot of other domains or industry aswell. In social media and apps, RFM can be used to segment users as well. Theonly difference is instead of using monetary value as the third metric, we willuse the amount of time spent (or some other metric based on it) on the site/app.The more time we spend on the platform and consume the content, the more adscan be displayed by the platform. So in those cases, the amount of time wespend will be the third metric.

## RFM Workflow

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_work_flow.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_work_flow.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


The typical workflow for RFM analysis is shown above. It can be broadly dividedinto the following:


In the first step of the workflow, we **collect transaction data**. Thisshould include a unique customer id, transaction date and transaction amount. Incase of ecommerce, we need to decide how to treat visits that did not result ina transaction. If data is aggregated and made available at the customer level,it must include a unique customer id, last transaction date and total revenuefrom the customer. The last transaction date may be replaced by days since lastvisit as well. The details available in data supplied depends on the datapipeline and the `rfm` package can handle any of the above 3 scenarios.


In the second step, we **generate RFM table** from the raw data available. TheRFM table aggregates data at the customer level. It includes the unique customerid, days since last transaction/visit, frequency of transactions/visits and thetotal revenue from all the transactions of the customer.


In the third step, we **generate scores** for recency, frequency and monetaryvalue, and use them to create the RFM score for each customer.


In the final step, we use the recency, frequency and monetary scores to**define customer segments** and design customised campaigns, promotions,offers & discounts to retain and reactivate customers.


## RFM Table

Let us assume we have completed the first step in RFM analysis by collectingtransaction data. Now, we have to generate the RFM table from the transactiondata. In the transaction data, each row represents a transaction and we may getthe transaction details in any of the following ways:

- according to transaction date

- sorted by customer id

- or in a random order


The first two cases are more likely but if we get the transaction data in arandom order, the first order of business is to sort them by customer id. Inthe below example, we have transaction details for 3 customers Lionel, Jaineeland Taj but they are not sorted by transaction date or customer id. Since wewant to create the RFM table from this data, we sort it by customer id.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_raw_sorted.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_raw_sorted.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


From the sorted data, we aggregate the transaction details at the customer levelas shown below.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_raw_sorted_aggregate.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_raw_sorted_aggregate.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


From the above step, we have created the RFM table which contains recency (dayssince last visit), frequency (frequency of visits) and monetary (total revenuefrom the customer) data for each customer.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_table.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_table.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


## Metrics

Time to talk about the key metrics **R**ecency, **F**requency and **M**onetaryin more detail. In this section, we will understand how they are calculated,and in the next section, we will learn how they are used for generating theRFM score.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segment_4.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segment_4.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


### Recency

Let us begin with recency. Earlier, we defined it as the number of days sincethe last transaction of the customer. How do we calculate this metric? Apartfrom the date of the last transaction of the customer, what other informationdo we need? In all the discussions till now, we have missed out on a key pointi.e. the time frame of the analysis.

The most crucial step in RFM analysis is to select a time frame from whichwe use the transaction data. How do we decide on this time frame? It dependson the domain to which we are applying this analysis. Customers visit a grocerystore more often than they visit a consumer durables store. Similarly, peopleconsume content from news & blogs more frequently while they may visit ane-commerce website only when they have to purchase something. Keeping in mindthe domain to which the analysis is being applied, select an appropriate timeframe. To calculate recency, compute the difference between the last transactiondate and the analysis date i.e. the last date of the selected time frame.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_recency_computation.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_recency_computation.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


In the above example, the analysis date is `2016-12-31`. To compute recency,we first extract all the transaction date of customer Taj and then select thelast transaction date, `2015-04-21`, and subtract if from the analysisdate to get the number of days since the last transaction date, `620`.

### Frequency

Frequency is the count of transactions. In the online/digital world, we need todecide whether we will consider all the visits to a website or app as thefrequency or only those which resulted in a transaction/conversion. In thebelow example, we count the transactions for each customer and use it asfrequency. Lionel has 6 transactions, Jaineel has 9 transactions and Taj has4 transactions.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_frequency_computation.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_frequency_computation.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


### Monetary Value

Monetary value is the total revenue from each customer in the selected timeframe. It is computed by summing up the transaction amount. In our case study,Jaineel has spent the highest amount of `$843`, followed by Lionel who hasspent `$472` and Taj has spent the lowest, `$196`. As you can observe, we havearrived at these figures by summing the values in the third column of thesecond table, `Order Amount`.

If we are applying this analysis to the digital world, we may think of usinga metric such as time spent on the website/app instead of transaction/orderamount.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_monetary_computation.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_monetary_computation.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


## RFM Score

As shown in the workflow, the third step in RFM analysis is to generate theindividual score for each metric and then use them to generate the RFM score. Inthis section, we will explain in detail how the scores are computed for recency,frequency and monetary. This section is slightly complex (we received a lot ofmails from readers after we published the previous post) and we have tried ourbest to break down the complexity as much as possible. Still, if you have anyquestions feel free to write to us at [email protected].

We follow the below steps to create the score:

- use quantiles to generate cut off points

- create intervals based on the cut off points

- use the intervals to assign score


### Monetary Score

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_monetary_score_interval.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_monetary_score_interval.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us generate the monetary score in our case study. The first step is tocompute the quantiles using the `quantile()` function. We use the revenuecolumn from the RFM table to compute the quantiles. If you look at the example,it gives us the cut off below which a certain percentage of customers arepresent.

- the bottom 20% of customers spend below `$254.8`.

- the next 20% of customers spend between `$254.8` and `$381.0`.

- the top 20% of customers spend above `$665.0`.


Using these cut off points we have created intervals which can then be convertedto `if else` statements. The intervals are then used to assign scores. Forexample, Lionel falls in the interval `> 381.0 & <= 505.4` and hence is assignedthe score `3`. Similarly, Jaineel and Taj are assigned the scores `5` and `1`.How do we interpret the scores? The score is more like a rank. A customer witha score of 3 is ranked higher than a customer with score of 1 as his transactionamount is higher. In the `rfm` package, we use the above method to assign thescores.

Some users reverse the order of the score i.e. top 20% customers by transactionamountare assigned the score 1 and the bottom 20% are assigned the score 5.

### Frequency Score

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_frequency_score_interval.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_frequency_score_interval.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


The frequency score is computed in the same way as the monetary score. Insteadof using the revenue column from the RFM table, we use the frequency column.Using quantiles, we arrive at the cut off points below which a certainpercentage of customer are present. If you observe the example, the first tableshows the quantiles and the associated cut off points.

- the bottom 20% of customers visit/transact less than 3 times.

- the next 20% of customers visit/transact around 4 times.

- the top 20% of customers visit/transact more than 7 times.


The cut off points are then used to create the intervals and assign the scoresas shown in the second table. We assign a higher score to those who visit morefrequently and a lower score to those who visit less frequently.

In our case study, Jaineel has visited 9 times and hence assigned the score 5where as Taj has visited only 4 times and hence the score 2.

### Recency Score

The recency score follows the same methodology but uses a slightly differentconcept while assigning the score. If you look at the metrics, the higher thevalues of frequency and monetary, the better as we want customers to transactfrequently and spend higher amount but it is not the case with recency. Sincerecency represents the number of days since the last transaction, the lower itsvalue the better i.e. customers who visited in the recent past are more likelyto visit again whereas customers who visited long back may be as good as lost.Hence in the case of recency, higher score is assigned to those with lowerrecency value and vice versa.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_recency_score_interval.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_recency_score_interval.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


In the above example, we have used quantiles to compute the cut off point forrecency. The first table shows the quantiles and the associated cut off points:

- the bottom 20% of customers visited more than `481` days back.

- the next 20% of customers visited between `296.4` and `481` days back.

- the top 20% of customers visited less than 114 days back.


The above statements will become clear if you study the second table whichincludes the interval and the score. We have assigned a higher score to thosewho visited in the recent past (< 114 days) compared to those who visited wayback (> 481 days). In our case study, Jaineel visited in the past 3 months andhence the score of 5 where as Taj visited almost 20 months back and has beenassigned the score 1.

### RFM Score

Now that we have calculated the individual scores, let us compute the RFM scoreusing the below formula:

`RFM Score = Recency Score * 100 + Frequency Score * 10 + Monetary Score`

The below table shows the individal scores of recency, frequency and monetary aswell as the RFM score. All of them are computed from the RFM table which initself is based on the transaction data.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_score_table.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_score_table.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


## Segments

Great! We have finally computed the RFM score. Now what? How do we define thesegments using this score? In this section, we will learn how to define customersegments using the RFM score. The below table is an example of how segments aredefined. It has the following details:

- the name of the segment

- the definition of the segment

- the intervals for the recency, frequency & monetary scores


We should be careful while creating the intervals for the scores in thesegments table. Look at this Wkipedia article to understand how intervals work.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segments_table.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segments_table.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us apply the above rules to our case study.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segments.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/rfm_segments.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Defining segments is another crucial step in RFM analysis. We need to ensurethat there is no duplication or large number of customers get classified into`Others` segment. In the case study, we will show you some of the mistakesthat can happen while defining the segments.

## Case Study

It is time to work through the case study. Let us first load all the libraries wewill use as shown below:

```
library(rfm)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(lubridate)
```

### Data

To calculate the RFM score for each customer we need transaction data which should include the following:

- a unique customer id

- date of transaction/order

- transaction/order amount


`rfm` includes a sample data set `rfm_data_orders` which includes the abovedetails:

```
rfm_data_orders
```

```

### RFM Score

Use `rfm_table_order()` to generate the score for each customer from the sampledata set `rfm_data_orders`.

`rfm_table_order()` takes 8 inputs:

`data`: a data set with

- unique customer id

- date of transaction

- and amount


### RFM Table

```
analysis_date <- lubridate::as_date("2006-12-31", tz = "UTC")
rfm_result <- rfm_table_order(rfm_data_orders, customer_id, order_date, revenue, analysis_date)
rfm_result
```

`rfm_table_order()` will return the following columns as seen in the above table:

- `customer_id`: unique customer id

- `date_most_recent`: date of most recent visit

- `recency_days`: days since the most recent visit

- `transaction_count`: number of transactions of the customer

- `amount`: total revenue generated by the customer

- `recency_score`: recency score of the customer

- `frequency_score`: frequency score of the customer

- `monetary_score`: monetary score of the customer

- `rfm_score`: RFM score of the customer


### Segments

Let us classify our customers based on the individual recency, frequency andmonetary scores.

SegmentDescriptionRFM
|------
|Champions|Bought recently, buy often and spend the most|4 – 5|4 – 5|4 – 5|
|Loyal Customers|Spend good money. Responsive to promotions|2 – 4|3 – 4|4 – 5|
|Potential Loyalist|Recent customers, spent good amount, bought more than once|3 – 5|1 – 3|1 – 3|
|New Customers|Bought more recently, but not often|4 – 5|< 2|< 2|
|Promising|Recent shoppers, but haven’t spent much|3 – 4|< 2|< 2|
|Need Attention|Above average recency, frequency & monetary values|3 – 4|3 – 4|3 – 4|
|About To Sleep|Below average recency, frequency & monetary values|2 – 3|< 3|< 3|
|At Risk|Spent big money, purchased often but long time ago|< 3|2 – 5|2 – 5|
|Can’t Lose Them|Made big purchases and often, but long time ago|< 2|4 – 5|4 – 5|
|Hibernating|Low spenders, low frequency, purchased long time ago|2 – 3|2 – 3|2 – 3|
|Lost|Lowest recency, frequency & monetary scores|< 2|< 2|< 2|

### Segmented Customer Data

We can use the segmented data to identify

- champion customers

- loyal customers

- at risk customers

- and lost customers


Once we have classified a customer into a particular segment, we can takeappropriate action to increase his/her lifetime value.

### Bar Chart

Use `rfm_bar_chart()` to generate the distribution of monetary scores for thedifferent combinations of frequency and recency scores.

```
rfm_bar_chart(rfm_result)
```

### Histogram

Use `rfm_histograms()` to examine the relative distribution of

- monetary value (total revenue generated by each customer)

- recency days (days since the most recent visit for each customer)

- frequency (transaction count for each customer)


```
rfm_histograms(rfm_result)

### Scatter Plots

The best customers are those who:

- bought most recently

- most often

- and spend the most


Now let us examine the relationship between the above.

#### Recency vs Monetary Value

Customers who visited more recently generated more revenue compared to thosewho visited in the distant past. The customers who visited in the recent pastare more likely to return compared to those who visited long time ago as mostof those would be lost customers. As such, higher revenue would be associatedwith most recent visits.

```

```

#### Frequency vs Monetary Value

As the frequency of visits increases, the revenue generated also increases.Customers who visit more frquently are your champion customers, loyal customersor potential loyalists and they drive higher revenue.

```
rfm_fm_plot(rfm_result)
```

#### Recency vs Frequency

Customers with low frequency visited in the distant past while those with highfrequency have visited in the recent past. Again, the customers who visited inthe recent past are more likely to return compared to those who visited longtime ago. As such, higher frequency would be associated with the most recentvisits.

### Your Turn…


if you look at the distribution of segments, around 13% of the customersare in the `Others` segment For segmentation to be effective and optimal, the`Others` segment should be eliminated or should have few customers only.Redefine the segments and try to reduce the number of customers in the `Others`segment.


we have defined 11 segments. Try to combine some of the existing segmentsand bring down the total segments to around 6 or 8.


the RFM score we generated uses score between 1 and 5. Try to create segmentsby using a score between 1 and 3 i.e. the lowest RFM should be 111 and thehighest should be 333 instead of 555.


reverse the scores i.e. so far we have assigned a score of 5 to customers whovisited recently, frequently and had higher transaction amount and 1 tocustomers who visited way back, rarely and have low transaction amount. Reversethis score pattern and create the segments.
