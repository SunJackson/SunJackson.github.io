Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a kind of neural network that specialize in processing **sequences**. Theyâ€™re often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks because of their effectiveness in handling text. In this post, weâ€™ll **explore what RNNs are, understand how they work, and build a real one from scratch** (using only numpy) in Python.

**This post assumes a basic knowledge of neural networks**. My introduction to Neural Networks covers everything youâ€™ll need to know, so Iâ€™d recommend reading that first.

Letâ€™s get into it!

## 1. The Why

One issue with vanilla neural nets (and also CNNs) is that they only work with pre-determined sizes: they take **fixed-size inputs** and produce **fixed-size outputs**. RNNs are useful because they let us have **variable-length sequences** as both inputs and outputs. Here are a few examples of what RNNs can look like:






 This ability to process sequences makes RNNs very useful. For example:

- **Machine Translation** (e.g. Google Translate) is done with â€œmany to manyâ€� RNNs. The original text sequence is fed into an RNN, which then produces translated text as output.

- **Sentiment Analysis** (e.g. *Is this a positive or negative review?*) is often done with â€œmany to oneâ€� RNNs. The text to be analyzed is fed into an RNN, which then produces a single output classification (e.g. *This is a positive review*).


Later in this post, weâ€™ll build a â€œmany to oneâ€� RNN from scratch to perform basic Sentiment Analysis.

## 2. The How

Letâ€™s consider a â€œmany to manyâ€� RNN with inputs x0,x1,â€¦xnx_0, x_1, \ldots x_nx0â€‹,x1â€‹,â€¦xnâ€‹ that wants to produce outputs y0,y1,â€¦yny_0, y_1, \ldots y_ny0â€‹,y1â€‹,â€¦ynâ€‹. These xix_ixiâ€‹ and yiy_iyiâ€‹ are **vectors** and can have arbitrary dimensions.

RNNs work by iteratively updating a hidden state hhh, which is a vector that can also have arbitrary dimension. At any given step ttt,

1. The next hidden state hth_thtâ€‹ is calculated using the previous hidden state htâˆ’1h_{t-1}htâˆ’1â€‹ and the next input xtx_txtâ€‹.

1. The next output yty_tytâ€‹ is calculated using hth_thtâ€‹.

A many to many RNN

Hereâ€™s what makes a RNN *recurrent*: **it uses the same weights for each step**. More specifically, a typical vanilla RNN uses only 3 sets of weights to perform its calculations:

- WxhW_{xh}Wxhâ€‹, used for all xtx_txtâ€‹ â†’ hth_thtâ€‹ links.

- WhhW_{hh}Whhâ€‹, used for all htâˆ’1h_{t-1}htâˆ’1â€‹ â†’ hth_thtâ€‹ links.

- WhyW_{hy}Whyâ€‹, used for all hth_thtâ€‹ â†’ yty_tytâ€‹ links.


Weâ€™ll also use two biases for our RNN:

- bhb_hbhâ€‹, added when calculating hth_thtâ€‹.

- byb_ybyâ€‹, added when calculating yty_tytâ€‹.


Weâ€™ll represent the weights as *matrices* and the biases as *vectors*. These 3 weights and 2 biases make up the entire RNN!

**Here are the equations that put everything together:**

All the weights are applied using matrix multiplication, and the biases are added to the resulting products. We then use tanh as an activation function for the first equation (but other activations like sigmoid can also be used).

> 
No idea what an activation function is? Read my introduction to Neural Networks like I mentioned. Seriously.


## 3. The Problem

Letâ€™s get our hands dirty! Weâ€™ll implement an RNN from scratch to perform a simple Sentiment Analysis task: **determining whether a given text string is positive or negative.**

Here are a few samples from the small dataset I put together for this post:

|Text|Positive?
|------
|i am good|âœ“|
|i am bad|â�Œ|
|this is very good|âœ“|
|this is not bad|âœ“|
|i am bad not good|â�Œ|
|i am not at all happy|â�Œ|
|this was good earlier|âœ“|
|i am not at all bad or sad right now|âœ“|

## 4. The Plan

Since this is a classification problem, weâ€™ll use a â€œmany to oneâ€� RNN. This is similar to the â€œmany to manyâ€� RNN we discussed earlier, but it only uses the final hidden state to produce the one output yyy:

![](https://victorzhou.com/media/rnn-post/many-to-one.svg)
A many to one RNN

Each xix_ixiâ€‹ will be a vector representing a word from the text. The output yyy will be a vector containing two numbers, one representing positive and the other negative. Weâ€™ll apply Softmax to turn those values into probabilities and ultimately decide between positive / negative.

Letâ€™s start building our RNN!

## 5. The Pre-Processing

The dataset I mentioned earlier consists of two Python dictionaries:

```
train_data = {
 'good': True,
 'bad': False,
 
}

test_data = {
 'this is happy': True,
 'i am good': True,
 
}
```

Weâ€™ll have to do some pre-processing to get the data into a usable format. To start, weâ€™ll construct a **vocabulary** of all words that exist in our data:

```
from data import train_data, test_data


vocab = list(set([w for text in train_data.keys() for w in text.split(' ')]))
vocab_size = len(vocab)
print('%d unique words found' % vocab_size) 
```

`vocab` now holds a list of all words that appear in at least one training text. Next, weâ€™ll **assign an integer index** to represent each word in our vocab.

```

word_to_idx = { w: i for i, w in enumerate(vocab) }
idx_to_word = { i: w for i, w in enumerate(vocab) }
print(word_to_idx['good']) 
print(idx_to_word[0]) 
```

We can now represent any given word with its corresponding integer index! This is necessary because RNNs canâ€™t understand words - we have to give them numbers.

Finally, recall that each input xix_ixiâ€‹ to our RNN is a *vector*. Weâ€™ll use **one-hot vectors**, which contain all zeros except for a single one. The â€œoneâ€� in each one-hot vector will be **at the wordâ€™s corresponding integer index.**

Since we have 18 unique words in our vocabulary, each xix_ixiâ€‹ will be a 18-dimensional one-hot vector.

```
import numpy as np

def createInputs(text):
 '''
 Returns an array of one-hot vectors representing the words
 in the input text string.
 - text is a string
 - Each one-hot vector has shape (vocab_size, 1)
 '''
 inputs = []
 for w in text.split(' '):
 v = np.zeros((vocab_size, 1))
 v[word_to_idx[w]] = 1
 inputs.append(v)
 return inputs
```

Weâ€™ll use `createInputs()` later to create vector inputs to pass in to our RNN.

## 6. The Forward Phase

Itâ€™s time to start implementing our RNN! Weâ€™ll start by initializing the 3 weights and 2 biases our RNN needs:

```
import numpy as np
from numpy.random import randn

class RNN:
 

 def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, hidden_size=64):
 
 self.Whh = randn(hidden_size, hidden_size) / 1000
 self.Wxh = randn(hidden_size, input_size) / 1000
 self.Why = randn(output_size, hidden_size) / 1000

 
 self.bh = np.zeros((hidden_size, 1))
 self.by = np.zeros((output_size, 1))
```

We use np.random.randn() to initialize our weights from the standard normal distribution.

Next, letâ€™s implement our RNNâ€™s forward pass. Remember these two equations we saw earlier?

Here are those same equations put into code:

```
class RNN:
 

 def forward(self, inputs):
 '''
 Perform a forward pass of the RNN using the given inputs.
 Returns the final output and hidden state.
 - inputs is an array of one hot vectors with shape (input_size, 1).
 '''
 h = np.zeros((self.Whh.shape[0], 1))

 
 for i, x in enumerate(inputs):
 h = np.tanh(self.Wxh @ x + self.Whh @ h + self.bh)

 
 y = self.Why @ h + self.by

 return y, h
```

Pretty simple, right? Note that we initialized initialized hhh to the zero vector for the first step, since thereâ€™s no previous hhh we can use at that point.

Letâ€™s try it out:

```


def softmax(xs):
 
 return np.exp(xs) / sum(np.exp(xs))


rnn = RNN(vocab_size, 2)

inputs = createInputs('i am very good')
out, h = rnn.forward(inputs)
probs = softmax(out)
print(out) 
```

> 
Need a refresher on Softmax? Read my quick explanation of Softmax.


Our RNN works, but itâ€™s not very useful yet. Letâ€™s change thatâ€¦

## 7. The Backward Phase

In order to train our RNN, we first need a loss function. Weâ€™ll use **cross-entropy loss**, which is often paired with Softmax. Hereâ€™s how we calculate it:

where pcp_cpcâ€‹ is our RNNâ€™s predicted probability for the *correct* class (positive or negative). For example, if a positive text is predicted to be 90% positive by our RNN, the loss is:

> 
Want a longer explanation? Read the Cross-Entropy Loss section of my introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).


Now that we have a loss, weâ€™ll train our RNN using gradient descent to minimize loss. That means itâ€™s time to derive some gradients!

âš ï¸� **The following section assumes a basic knowledge of multivariable calculus**. You can skip it if you want, but I recommend giving it a skim even if you donâ€™t understand much. **Weâ€™ll incrementally write code as we derive results**, and even a surface-level understanding can be helpful.

If you want some extra background for this section, I recommend first reading the Training a Neural Network section of my introduction to Neural Networks. Also, all of the code for this post is on Github, so you can follow along there if youâ€™d like.


Ready? Here we go.

### 7.1 Definitions

First, some definitions:

- Let yyy represent the raw outputs from our RNN.

- Let ppp represent the final probabilities: p=softmax(y)p = \text{softmax}(y)p=softmax(y).

- Let ccc refer to the true label of a certain text sample, a.k.a. the â€œcorrectâ€� class. 

- Let LLL be the cross-entropy loss: L=âˆ’lnâ�¡(pc)L = -\ln(p_c)L=âˆ’ln(pcâ€‹).

- Let WxhW_{xh}Wxhâ€‹, WhhW_{hh}Whhâ€‹, and WhyW_{hy}Whyâ€‹ be the 3 weight matrices in our RNN.

- Let bhb_hbhâ€‹ and byb_ybyâ€‹ be the 2 bias vectors in our RNN.


### 7.2 Setup

Next, we need to edit our forward phase to cache some data for use in the backward phase. While weâ€™re at it, weâ€™ll also setup the skeleton for our backwards phase. Hereâ€™s what that looks like:

```
class RNN:
 

 def forward(self, inputs):
 '''
 Perform a forward pass of the RNN using the given inputs.
 Returns the final output and hidden state.
 - inputs is an array of one hot vectors with shape (input_size, 1).
 '''
 h = np.zeros((self.Whh.shape[0], 1))

 self.last_inputs = inputs self.last_hs = { 0: h }
 
 for i, x in enumerate(inputs):
 h = np.tanh(self.Wxh @ x + self.Whh @ h + self.bh)
 self.last_hs[i + 1] = h
 
 y = self.Why @ h + self.by

 return y, h

 def backprop(self, d_y, learn_rate=2e-2): ''' Perform a backward pass of the RNN. - d_y (dL/dy) has shape (output_size, 1). - learn_rate is a float. ''' pass
```

> 
Curious about why weâ€™re doing this caching? Read my explanation in the Training Overview of my introduction to CNNs, in which we do the same thing.


### 7.3 Gradients

Itâ€™s math time! Weâ€™ll start by calculating âˆ‚Lâˆ‚y\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}âˆ‚yâˆ‚Lâ€‹. We know:

Iâ€™ll leave the actual derivation of âˆ‚Lâˆ‚y\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}âˆ‚yâˆ‚Lâ€‹ using the Chain Rule as an exercise for you ğŸ˜‰, but the result comes out really nice:

For example, if we have p=[0.2,0.2,0.6]p = [0.2, 0.2, 0.6]p=[0.2,0.2,0.6] and the correct class is c=0c = 0c=0, then weâ€™d get âˆ‚Lâˆ‚y=[âˆ’0.8,0.2,0.6]\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = [-0.8, 0.2, 0.6]âˆ‚yâˆ‚Lâ€‹=[âˆ’0.8,0.2,0.6]. This is also quite easy to turn into code:

```

for x, y in train_data.items():
 inputs = createInputs(x)
 target = int(y)

 
 out, _ = rnn.forward(inputs)
 probs = softmax(out)

 d_L_d_y = probs d_L_d_y[target] -= 1
 
 rnn.backprop(d_L_d_y)
```

Nice. Next up, letâ€™s take a crack at gradients for WhyW_{hy}Whyâ€‹ and byb_ybyâ€‹, which are only used to turn the final hidden state into the RNNâ€™s output. We have:

where hnh_nhnâ€‹ is the final hidden state. Thus,

Similarly,

We can now start implementing `backprop()`!

```
class RNN:
 

 def backprop(self, d_y, learn_rate=2e-2):
 '''
 Perform a backward pass of the RNN.
 - d_y (dL/dy) has shape (output_size, 1).
 - learn_rate is a float.
 '''
 n = len(self.last_inputs)

 
 d_Why = d_y @ self.last_hs[n].T d_by = d_y
```

> 
Reminder: We created `self.last_hs` in `forward()` earlier.


Finally, we need the gradients for WhhW_{hh}Whhâ€‹, WxhW_{xh}Wxhâ€‹, and bhb_hbhâ€‹, which are used *every* step during the RNN. We have:

because changing WxhW_{xh}Wxhâ€‹ affects *every* hth_thtâ€‹, which all affect yyy and ultimately LLL. In order to fully calculate the gradient of WxhW_{xh}Wxhâ€‹, weâ€™ll need to backpropagate through *all* timesteps, which is known as **Backpropagation Through Time** (BPTT):

![](https://victorzhou.com/media/rnn-post/bptt.svg)
Backpropagation Through Time

WxhW_{xh}Wxhâ€‹ is used for all xtx_txtâ€‹ â†’ hth_thtâ€‹ forward links, so we have to backpropagate back to each of those links.

{% raw %}
Once we arrive at a given step ttt, we need to calculate âˆ‚htâˆ‚Wxh\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial W_{xh}}âˆ‚Wxhâ€‹âˆ‚htâ€‹â€‹:
{% endraw %}

The derivative of tanhâ�¡\tanhtanh is well-known:

We use Chain Rule like usual:

Similarly,

The last thing we need is âˆ‚yâˆ‚ht\frac{\partial y}{\partial h_t}âˆ‚htâ€‹âˆ‚yâ€‹. We can calculate this recursively:

{% raw %}
Weâ€™ll implement BPTT starting from the last hidden state and working backwards, so weâ€™ll already have âˆ‚yâˆ‚ht+1\frac{\partial y}{\partial h_{t+1}}âˆ‚ht+1â€‹âˆ‚yâ€‹ by the time we want to calculate âˆ‚yâˆ‚ht\frac{\partial y}{\partial h_t}âˆ‚htâ€‹âˆ‚yâ€‹! The exception is the last hidden state, hnh_nhnâ€‹:
{% endraw %}

We now have everything we need to finally implement BPTT and finish `backprop()`:

```
class RNN:
 

 def backprop(self, d_y, learn_rate=2e-2):
 '''
 Perform a backward pass of the RNN.
 - d_y (dL/dy) has shape (output_size, 1).
 - learn_rate is a float.
 '''
 n = len(self.last_inputs)

 
 d_Why = d_y @ self.last_hs[n].T
 d_by = d_y

 
 d_Whh = np.zeros(self.Whh.shape)
 d_Wxh = np.zeros(self.Wxh.shape)
 d_bh = np.zeros(self.bh.shape)

 
 d_h = self.Why.T @ d_y

 for t in reversed(range(n)):
 
 temp = ((1 - self.last_hs[t + 1] ** 2) * d_h)

 d_bh += temp
 d_Whh += temp @ self.last_hs[t].T
 d_Wxh += temp @ self.last_inputs[t].T
 
 d_h = self.Whh @ temp

 
 for d in [d_Wxh, d_Whh, d_Why, d_bh, d_by]:
 np.clip(d, -1, 1, out=d)

 
 self.Whh -= learn_rate * d_Whh
 self.Wxh -= learn_rate * d_Wxh
 self.Why -= learn_rate * d_Why
 self.bh -= learn_rate * d_bh
 self.by -= learn_rate * d_by
```

A few things to note:

- Weâ€™ve merged âˆ‚Lâˆ‚yâˆ—âˆ‚yâˆ‚h\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} * \frac{\partial y}{\partial h}âˆ‚yâˆ‚Lâ€‹âˆ—âˆ‚hâˆ‚yâ€‹ into âˆ‚Lâˆ‚h\frac{\partial L}{\partial h}âˆ‚hâˆ‚Lâ€‹ for convenience.

{% raw %}
- Weâ€™re constantly updating a `d_h` variable that holds the most recent âˆ‚Lâˆ‚ht+1\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_{t+1}}âˆ‚ht+1â€‹âˆ‚Lâ€‹, which we need to calculate âˆ‚Lâˆ‚ht\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t}âˆ‚htâ€‹âˆ‚Lâ€‹.
{% endraw %}

- After finishing BPTT, we np.clip() gradient values that are below -1 or above 1. This helps mitigate the **exploding gradient** problem, which is when gradients become very large due to having lots of multiplied terms. Exploding or vanishing gradients are quite problematic for vanilla RNNs - more complex RNNs like LSTMs are generally better-equipped to handle them.

- Once all gradients are calculated, we update weights and biases using **gradient descent**.


Weâ€™ve done it! Our RNN is complete.

## 8. The Culmination

Itâ€™s finally the moment we been waiting for - letâ€™s test our RNN!

First, weâ€™ll write a helper function to process data with our RNN:

```
import random

def processData(data, backprop=True):
 '''
 Returns the RNN's loss and accuracy for the given data.
 - data is a dictionary mapping text to True or False.
 - backprop determines if the backward phase should be run.
 '''
 items = list(data.items())
 random.shuffle(items)

 loss = 0
 num_correct = 0

 for x, y in items:
 inputs = createInputs(x)
 target = int(y)

 
 out, _ = rnn.forward(inputs)
 probs = softmax(out)

 
 loss -= np.log(probs[target])
 num_correct += int(np.argmax(probs) == target)

 if backprop:
 
 d_L_d_y = probs
 d_L_d_y[target] -= 1

 
 rnn.backprop(d_L_d_y)

 return loss / len(data), num_correct / len(data)
```

Now, we can write the training loop:

```

for epoch in range(1000):
 train_loss, train_acc = processData(train_data)

 if epoch % 100 == 99:
 print('--- Epoch %d' % (epoch + 1))
 print('Train:\tLoss %.3f | Accuracy: %.3f' % (train_loss, train_acc))

 test_loss, test_acc = processData(test_data, backprop=False)
 print('Test:\tLoss %.3f | Accuracy: %.3f' % (test_loss, test_acc))
```

Running `main.py` should output something like this:

```
--- Epoch 100
Train: Loss 0.688 | Accuracy: 0.517
Test: Loss 0.700 | Accuracy: 0.500
--- Epoch 200
Train: Loss 0.680 | Accuracy: 0.552
Test: Loss 0.717 | Accuracy: 0.450
--- Epoch 300
Train: Loss 0.593 | Accuracy: 0.655
Test: Loss 0.657 | Accuracy: 0.650
--- Epoch 400
Train: Loss 0.401 | Accuracy: 0.810
Test: Loss 0.689 | Accuracy: 0.650
--- Epoch 500
Train: Loss 0.312 | Accuracy: 0.862
Test: Loss 0.693 | Accuracy: 0.550
--- Epoch 600
Train: Loss 0.148 | Accuracy: 0.914
Test: Loss 0.404 | Accuracy: 0.800
--- Epoch 700
Train: Loss 0.008 | Accuracy: 1.000
Test: Loss 0.016 | Accuracy: 1.000
--- Epoch 800
Train: Loss 0.004 | Accuracy: 1.000
Test: Loss 0.007 | Accuracy: 1.000
--- Epoch 900
Train: Loss 0.002 | Accuracy: 1.000
Test: Loss 0.004 | Accuracy: 1.000
--- Epoch 1000
Train: Loss 0.002 | Accuracy: 1.000
Test: Loss 0.003 | Accuracy: 1.000
```

Not bad from a RNN we built ourselves. ğŸ’¯
