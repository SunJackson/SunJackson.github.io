Have you ever wanted to try out a speech recognition project but found it all just too intimidating?

What about creating something a few steps beyond and a bit more complex, like a full audio chatbot or a voice assistant? 

Putting together skeleton code for this type of a project is actually quite straightforward, thanks to a few open source libraries which we can lean on. With that in mind, let's have a look at how to start creating a basic toy speech recognition app with Python. Once we get the basics down we can discuss ways to make it much more useful.

Our toy Python app will be pretty useless, to be honest. But it will introduce us to a few concepts which will be useful for building more complex things afterwards. If we build this toy properly, modifying it to do anything more should be relatively painless. At least, to an extent.

Here's *exactly* what our app will do when we're done: it will listen to what we say and parrot it back to us. That's it! The pair of useful things we will take away are building speech recognition and audio playback into our app.

First, let's import the few libraries that we need:



 

Here's the reasoning:

**`speech_recognition`** - "Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline"
**`pydub`** - "Manipulate audio with a simple and easy high level interface"
**`gTTS`** - "Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API"

The next thing to do — and likely most importantly for a speech recognition app — is to recognize speech. To do so, we'll need to first capture incoming audio from the microphone, and then perform the speech recognition. This is all handled via the `speech_recognition` library.

Here's a function to capture speech.



 

That's it. Speech captured and recognized. Still think this is intimidating?

Note that once this app starts running, it will listen in 5 seconds intervals, and process these 5 second intervals one at a time. Practical? No, not really, but once we do something more complex we can tweak this to, perhaps, listen for an activation keyword, and then listen for the full duration of our speaking, regardless of length. However, this is a simple enough way to start.

So, what will we do after we capture speech? We'll process it. What exactly does this mean?

What kind of app you are building will largely determine what "process it" means. This time around, our processing will more or less be a placeholder function to do other things in the future. So for now, our toy app will process captured speech by parroting it back to us (and outputting it to the console, for good measure).

Here's a simple function for our processing.



 

We also want our app to speak, so let's write a function which uses the Google text-to-speech engine to accomplish this.



 

First we print out what was passed to the function to the console; then Google text-to-speech is used to create an audio file from the text; the audio file is saved to disk; and then the file is re-opened and played using the `pydub` library.

That's the "difficult" stuff taken care of. Now we just need a few lines to drive the process.



 

Both the `speak()` and `capture()` functions are used to get the user's name when prompted, and then greet them. Then a while loop is entered which cycles between capturing speech input and performing some very elementary checks to ensure that *something* was captured and the user did not say 'quit' to exit. The captured text is passed to the `process_text()` function, which echoes what was said. This is then repeated *ad infinitum*.

I'll say it again: there isn't anything of much complexity going on here.

Save all of the above code to a file, `voice_recognition_test.py`.

Now let's check out a conversation with our minimalist speech recognition app. Run it with the following line and see the results below (while imagining I'm talking and having my words repeated back to me, of course).
