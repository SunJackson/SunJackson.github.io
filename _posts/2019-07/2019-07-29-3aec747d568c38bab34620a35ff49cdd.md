This incredibly exciting enterprise will entrench Monash as the pre-eminent Australian institute for blockchain technology.

Drawing upon expertise from the Faculty of IT (FIT) as well as other key research areas University-wide, Monash BTC will focus on 3 key streams of activity; namely: Research, Education, and Training.  Led by experts in the underlying technology, with engagement from researchers from across the University and industry, and powered by expertise across the fields of cybersecurity, cryptography, digital health, finance, and the social sciences, the Centre will deliver unprecedented development of blockchain technology, and represents one of the most exciting blockchain opportunities yet seen.

As part of the teaching and research role, the successful applicant will form an integral part of the emergent Monash BTC, and will engage in teaching, including the development of education resources and new course units; and research of cutting-edge blockchain technologies and practices.

This role is a full-time position; however, flexible working arrangements may be negotiated.
