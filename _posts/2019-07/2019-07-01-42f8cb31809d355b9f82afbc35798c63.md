My new book, *Probability and Statistics for Data Science: Math + R + Data,* pub. by the CRC Press, was released on June 24!

This book arose from an open-source text I wrote and have been teaching from. The open source version will still be available, though rather different from the published one. 

This is a math stat book, but different from all others, as the subtitle states: Math + R + Data. Even the topic ordering is rather different, with a goal of bringing in data science-relevant material as early as possible. 

I’ve placed an excerpt from the book at http://tinyurl.com/y6hf7x66. I believe it epitomizes the intent and style of the book. Also, I’ve placed the front matter at http://tinyurl.com/yy9hx6db
