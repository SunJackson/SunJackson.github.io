In my previous post https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2019/02/03/sobol-sequence-vs-uniform-random-in-hyper-parameter-optimization/, I’ve shown the difference between the uniform pseudo random and the quasi random number generators in the hyper-parameter optimization of machine learning. 

Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is another interesting way to generate near-random sequences with a very simple idea. Let’s assume that we’d like to perform LHS for 10 data points in the 1-dimension data space. We first partition the whole data space into 10 equal intervals and then randomly select a data point from each interval. For the N-dimension LHS with N > 1, we just need to independently repeat the 1-dimension LHS for N times and then randomly combine these sequences into a list of N-tuples. 

LHS is similar to the Uniform Random in the sense that the Uniform Random number is drawn within each equal-space interval. On the other hand, LHS covers the data space more evenly in a way similar to the Quasi Random, such as Sobol Sequence. A comparison below shows how each of three looks like in the 2-dimension data space.

In the example below, three types of random numbers are applied to the hyper-parameter optimization of General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) in the 1-dimension case. While both Latin Hypercube and Sobol Sequence generate similar averages of CV R-squares, the variance of CV R-squares for Latin Hypercube is much lower. With no surprise, the performance of simple Uniform Random remains the lowest, e.g. lower mean and higher variance.
