In Tableau, a waffle chart is NOT one of the off-the-shelf charts that you can make by clicking the â€œShow Meâ€� panel. If you want to create one, youâ€™ll need to be, err, creative.

## Setting Up

For this tutorial I will use the famous iris dataset. You can find it *anywhere*, but it is primarily hosted at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. Download it and get it into Tableau. **Important** â€“ Make sure that your spreadsheet software creates an â€œIDâ€� variable for each row (a row number for each row), and read it as a dimension.

**Some things to figure out:**

1. How to make a grid with your data (conventionally, a 10 x 10).

1. How to assign color to the squares/marks in that grid.

1. The calculation that will be used to create the color assignment.


Of course, thereâ€™s always more than one way to do things in Tableau. Iâ€™ll show my unique way of building a waffle chart which serves my data needs quite well.

We start by creating an index. To do so, all you have to do is make a calculated field with INDEX() in it.

Next up, use INDEX to partition the whole dataset into 10 rows to build out the x-axis. So letâ€™s figure out how many rows are in a â€œtenthâ€� of the data â€“ divide the maximum value of the index by 10 or multiply by 0.1. **Note** it is important to use ROUND to square off the value. If not, you will have rows of unequal lengths later.

To make the X-axis from here, I simply assign values based off of where their index stands in relation to each tenth percentile.

![](https://i2.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/%5Bx%5D.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/%5Bx%5D.png?w=456)


At this point, you place your newly created X variable on the rows shelf and choose to â€œcompute using ____â€� (your dimension/row-level ID variable), and doing so you can see a neat little row of marks as such:

![](https://i1.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/%5Bx%5D%20row.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/%5Bx%5D%20row.png?w=456)


Now we need to expand this single row into 10 Y-values. If you guessed that we will now partition the X-values into 10 different rows, you are right. To do this I multiply the index value by 100 and divide by the maximum index value. This is exactly what it sounds like â€“ a percentage. Note that rounding the values to the nearest integer is very important. Without doing so we wonâ€™t achieve a neatly separated 10 x 10 grid but a continuous line of marks instead.

![](https://i2.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/%5By%5D.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/%5By%5D.png?w=456)


The result is not a beautiful 10Ã—10 grid, but a beautiful 11 x 11 grid.

![](https://i1.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/11x11%20grid.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)

This is because of the rounding we did earlier â€“ for each tenth percentile partiion of X, the bottom portion of the Y values were closer to 0 than 1, which means they were rounded down. Other tutorials may have a workaround, however, they seem to employ other means which require their own unique workarounds as well. At the end of the day, youâ€™re probably going to need a workaround. Here is mine:

Simply fold the 0 and 1 Y values into each other with another calculated field, as such.

![](https://i1.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/Y.png?w=456)
 **And we get ====>**![](https://i0.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/10x10%20grid.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)

Voila! Now we have our â€œtemplateâ€� for a waffle chart! Not that it was necessary to fold all the values of our data into the chart.

**But we canâ€™t eat waffles yet** â€“ we need to assign color to it first. I suppose Iâ€™ll color the waffle chart based off of the percentage of Virginica species in the Iris dataset. Notice that I need to use fixed LOD calculations for this. Since the â€œViewâ€� influences calculations, it is best to work with an LOD which will compute the calculation first in spite of whatever is happening in the view.

![](https://i1.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/Total%20Virginica.png?w=456)
![](https://i2.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/Percentage%20Virginica.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/Percentage%20Virginica.png?w=456)


Now we are ready to assign a color using the percentage variable. The logic is profoundly simple once you figure out the concept. Essentially, you need to tell Tableau to color a mark based off of the values it is less than. That means, multiplying X values by 10, Y values by 1, and starting by looking at the previous row. This calculation handles all possibilities, except of course doing partial squares.

![](https://i1.wp.com/jjohn987.rbind.io/post/2019-07-08-tableau-creating-a-waffle-chart_files/Waffle%20Color.png?w=456)


Presto! Now we can finalize the beautiful waffle chart!

33% of the flowers in the iris dataset belong to the virginica species.



The End â€“ Enjoy your Waffles!
