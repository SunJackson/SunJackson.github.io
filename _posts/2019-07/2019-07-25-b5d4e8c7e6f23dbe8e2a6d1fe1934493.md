I often make images of Raspberry Pi sdcards for easy installation and cloning. 
Unfortunately the size of the image will always be that of the size of the card, 
which is usually much larger than the amount of actual data.
Thankfully there is a way to shrink an image, though every tutorial i’ve seen
online is cumbersome and manual (e.g. using gparted). Instead I 
wrote a script
that does it automatically and shrinks the image to it’s minimal size.

NOTE: USE AT OWN RISK - THIS IS UNTESTED. ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR IMAGE BEFORE TRYING
THIS.

## Clone the script

```
git clone https://github.com/mtyka/shrinkwrap.git
cd shrinkwrap

```

## Copy the sd card over

Find your sdcard device, might be /dev/sdb or /dev/mmcblk0 or other.

Copy the image locally to an img file

```
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=myimage.img conv=fsync status=progress

```

## Shrink the image

```
./shrinkwrap.sh myimage.img

```

## Copy the image to new sd card

```
sudo dd bs=4M if=myimage.img of=/dev/mmcblk0.img conv=fsync status=progress

```

## Boot from the card

You can now resize the image back to take the full SD card size by going to:

And then choose “Expand root partition to fill SD card” option under Advanced 
Options.
