Python is one of the easiest programming languages to get started with, but environment setup can still be both frustrating and time consuming. When it comes to driving, we don’t make the student assemble the car before learning how to drive. Yet when it comes to learning Python, you first need to learn how to:

Install Python, preferably in a virtual environment
Use pip to install all requirements
Resolve any dependency conflicts, as needed

You need to learn all this before you can even start your Python course. This approach assumes you have some familiarity with Python before you’ve even installed it, which can be both a false assumption by the course creator, and intimidating for you.

There is an easier way to start coding with Python whether you’re new to the language or are an advanced developer. Learn how data scientists and anyone coding with Python can set up a made-to-order runtime in minutes - not days. Read the 3-minute blog post.
