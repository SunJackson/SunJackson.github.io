The *Rosetta* mission of the *European Space Agency (ESA)* is one of the greatest (yet underappreciated) triumphs of humankind: it was launched in 2004 and landed the spacecraft *Philae* ten years later on a small comet, named 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (for the whole timeline of the mission see here: Timeline of *Rosetta* spacecraft). 

ESA provided the world with datasets of the comet which we will use to create an animated gif in R… so read on!

The only prerequisites that we need is the `rgl` package (on CRAN) and an installed version of *ImageMagick*: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php.

The script itself is very short due to the powerful functions of the `rgl` package, the dataset is loaded directly from the internet site of ESA:

The result is quite impressive:

I also used the dataset to create a 3D printout which is now on my desk in the office at my university:

What a symbol of the power of science to have a 3D printout of a cosmic roamer on your desk and an animated image of it on your computer!
