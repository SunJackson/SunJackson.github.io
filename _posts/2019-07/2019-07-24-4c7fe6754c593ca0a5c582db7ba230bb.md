Generators are very powerful feature in python and help you write better and organized code.

**WHY I use them**

As a developer, more than often I have to deal with sequential data. That could mean processing every item in the sequence either to prepare it for the next process or storing into some sort of database.

One of the most common data structure in python is list. And I use it a lot in my code. But it's not a good choice if number of items in sequence is unpredictable. For example, the length of list could be 5, 100, 10,000 or 5,00,0000 or even more.

```
def scale_to_log10(till_number):
 log10_number_seq = []
 for num in range(1, till_number):
 log10_number_seq.append(math.log10(num))
 return log10_number_seq

```

Code above is just nice and will give the expected output, If at all ![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f603.png)
.But again, think of the value of the "till_number" passed into the function. By nature, range function will create a list and load into memory and if your program is lucky enough to be running in a eternal memory space then everything will be fine, but. Now imagine this, the size of list generated by range function is 4GB and total memory space is 2GB, ouch. Process will crash with out-of-memory error and they will think you are bad developer ![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f615.png)
.

As a good, if not the great, developer we need to make sure that the function we are writing works as expected while utilizing physical reaources wisely, RAM and CPU mainly.

**HOW I use them**

To avoid the worst case scenario of process crashing and overloading the memory, which could be utilized by other processes, I use generators.

Here is the code.

```
def scale_to_log10(till_number):
 for num in xrange(till_number):
 yield math.log10(num)

```

Difference in between two code snippet is obvious. The generators version uses yield istead of return and also using xrange in place of range function. This is the example of lazy loading or lazy processing. Which means only the element being processed is loaded into memory not everything.

**P.S.** In python3, function range is same as xrange in python2. which means, range function in python3 returns generator object and python2 it returns a list.

**Conclusion**: Consider using generators when dealing with potentially large sequential data.
