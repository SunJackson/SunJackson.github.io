## Introduction

In this post, I introduce 2 new functions in my R package ‘cricketr’ (cricketr v0.22) see Re-introducing cricketr! : An R package to analyze performances of cricketers which enable granular analysis of batsmen and bowlers. They are

1. **Step 1**: getPlayerDataHA – This function is a wrapper around getPlayerData(), getPlayerDataOD() and getPlayerDataTT(), and adds an extra column ‘homeOrAway’ which says whether the match was played at home/away/neutral venues. A CSV file is created with this new column.

1. **Setp 2**: getPlayerDataOppnHA – This function allows you to slice & dice the data for batsmen and bowlers against specific oppositions, at home/away/neutral venues and between certain periods. This reduced subset of data can be used to perform analyses. A CSV file is created as an output based on the parameters of opposition, home or away and the interval of time


**Note** All the existing cricketr functions can be used on this smaller fine-grained data set for a closer analysis of players

**Note 1**: You have to call the above functions only once. You can reuse the CSV files in other functions

**Important note**: Don’t go too fine-grained by choosing just one opposition, in one of home/away/neutral and for too short a period. Too small a dataset may defeat the purpose of the analysis!

If you are passionate about cricket, and love analyzing cricket performances, then check out my racy book on cricket ‘Cricket analytics with cricketr and cricpy – Analytics harmony with R & Python’! This book discusses and shows how to use my R package ‘cricketr’ and my Python package ‘cricpy’ to analyze batsmen and bowlers in all formats of the game (Test, ODI and T20). The paperback is available on Amazon at $21.99 and  the kindle version at $9.99/Rs 449/-. A must read for any cricket lover! Check it out!!

## 1. Analyzing Tendulkar at 3 different stages of his career

The following functions analyze Sachin Tendulkar during 3 different periods of his illustrious career. a) 1st Jan 2001-1st Jan 2002 b) 1st Jan 2005-1st Jan 2006 c) 1st Jan 2012-1st Jan 2013

```
#Note: I have commented the lines to getPlayerDataHA() as I already have 
# CSV file



df1=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="tendulkarHA.csv",outfile="tendulkarTest2001.csv",

## 1b. Plot the performance of Tendulkar at venues during 2001,2005,2012

On an average Tendulkar score 60+ in 2001 and is really blazing. This performance decreases in 2005 and later in 2012

```
par(mfrow=c(1,3))

batsmanAvgRunsGround("tendulkarTest2001.csv","Tendulkar-2001")
batsmanAvgRunsGround("tendulkarTest2005.csv","Tendulkar-2005")
batsmanAvgRunsGround("tendulkarTest2012.csv","Tendulkar-2012")
```

## 3a. Compare the performances of Ganguly, Dravid and VVS Laxman against opposition in ‘away’ matches in Tests

```

## 6. Compute and performances of Anil Kumble, Muralitharan and Warne in ‘away’ test matches

```







df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="kumbleTestHA.csv",outfile="kumbleTest-NZWISAEng.csv"
 ,opposition=c("New Zealand", "West Indies", "South Africa","England"),
 homeOrAway=c("away"))

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="warneTestHA.csv",outfile="warneTest-NZWISAEng.csv"

 homeOrAway=c("away"))

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="muraliTestHA.csv",outfile="muraliTest-NZWISAEng.csv"
 ,opposition=c("New Zealand", "West Indies", "South Africa","England"),

```

## 7. Compute and plot the performances of Bumrah in 2016, 2017 and 2018 in ODIs

```

df=getPlayerDataHA(625383,tfile="bumrahODIHA.csv",type="bowling",matchType="ODI")
```

```
## [1] "Working..."
```

```

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="bumrahODIHA.csv",outfile="bumrahODI2016.csv",
 startDate="2016-01-01",endDate="2017-01-01")

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="bumrahODIHA.csv",outfile="bumrahODI2017.csv",
 startDate="2017-01-01",endDate="2018-01-01")

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="bumrahODIHA.csv",outfile="bumrahODI2018.csv",
 startDate="2018-01-01",endDate="2019-01-01")
```

## 8. Compute and plot the performances of Shakib, Bumrah and Jadeja in T20 matches for bowling

```

df=getPlayerDataHA(56143,tfile="shakibT20HA.csv",type="bowling",matchType="T20")
```

```
## [1] "Working..."
```

```
df=getPlayerDataHA(625383,tfile="bumrahT20HA.csv",type="bowling",matchType="T20")
```

```
## [1] "Working..."
```

```
df=getPlayerDataHA(234675,tfile="jadejaT20HA.csv",type="bowling",matchType="T20")
```

```
## [1] "Working..."
```

```

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="shakibT20HA.csv",outfile="shakibT20-SLAusSAEng.csv"
 ,opposition=c("Sri Lanka","Australia", "South Africa","England"),
 homeOrAway=c("all"))
df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="bumrahT20HA.csv",outfile="bumrahT20-SLAusSAEng.csv"
 ,opposition=c("Sri Lanka","Australia", "South Africa","England"),
 homeOrAway=c("all"))

df=getPlayerDataOppnHA(infile="jadejaT20HA.csv",outfile="jadejaT20-SLAusSAEng.csv"
 ,opposition=c("Sri Lanka","Australia", "South Africa","England"),
 homeOrAway=c("all"))
```

## Conclusion

By getting the homeOrAway data for players using the profileNo, you can slice and dice the data based on your choice of opposition, whether you want matches that were played at home/away/neutral venues. Finally by specifying the period for which the data has to be subsetted you can create fine grained analysis.

Hope you have a great time with cricketr!!!
