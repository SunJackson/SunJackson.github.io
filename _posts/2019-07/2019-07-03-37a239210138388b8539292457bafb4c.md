Yesterday, Microsoft's AI Customer Engineering Team posted the first in a series of blog posts on the state and future of support for R in Azure. Check out that post for some details on the forthcoming capabilities to support R and Python-based deployments in the Azure cloud service. 

The post references this guide to the machine learning services in Azure, along with their supported languages. Services that currently support R include Azure Machine Learning Studio, SQL Server Microsoft Machine Learning Service, Microsoft Machine Learning Server, Azure Data Science Virtual Machine, Azure Databricks, and more.

The post also notes that Microsoft is committed to bring R support to Azure Machine Learning Services. (I'll have further news about that in my talk at the useR conference in Toulouse.)

Future posts in the series will cover:

- A deeper dive on R operationalization options

- Big Data architectural topologies with R

- Orchestrating mixed R and Python Machine Learning pipelines with Azure Machine Learning Services


I'll provide links to those posts on this blog when they're published as well.
