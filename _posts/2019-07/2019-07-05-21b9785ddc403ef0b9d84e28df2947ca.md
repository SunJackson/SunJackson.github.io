In line with my previous round up posts:

I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my effortswill help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider Rcommunity. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links fromother sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic ofa certain talk. You can follow **TokyoR** by searching for the#TokyoR hashtag on Twitter.

Anyways…

Let’s get started!

As with every TokyoR meetup, we beganwith a set of beginner user focused talks:

## yutannihilation: tidyr 1.0.0

`@yutannihilation`, co-author of `ggplot2`, gave a talk about the newtidyr 1.0.0 version with special focus on the `pivot_longer()` and`pivot_wider()` functions that are to take over from (but not erase) the`gather()` and `spread()` functions respectively.

**1.** `pivot_longer(data, columns, ...)`: Make datasets **longer** (morerows, less columns)

- You can use the various `select()` helper functions to selectcolumns

- ex. `starts_with("col")`, `contains("july")`, `matches(".t.")`


- if the column name does not already exist in the dataframe youhave to wrap them in quotes, `""`


The above are pretty similar to what we had in `gather()` but some newarguments I found interesting were:

`names_prefix =` argument which lets you remove

- Ex. Values in column look like “day1”, “day2”, “day3”, etc., ifyou set `names_prefix = 'day'` it will remove “day” from thevalues in the column.


- Ex. After taking out “day” from the values in the above example,the number values in the column are still class “character”. Set`names_ptype = list(day = integer())` to specify that the columnshould be an integer class (see below image).

- `names_pattern =` and `names_sep =` work similarly in that youspecify a regex or symbol on which you want to separate the valuesinto the `names_to` columns you want to create.


**2.** `pivot_wider(columns, ...)`: Make datasets **wider** (less rows,more columns)

- `names_from =` and `values_from =` are like in `pivot_longer()`except the opposite way as we combine the column names and specifywhich column the values for the new column comes from.

- `values_fill =`: use this argument to specify what each value shouldbe when missing.

- `names_sep =` and `names_prefix =`: Much like their counterparts in`pivot_longer()` except they create new column names using “sep” valueto separate names and add a prefix, respectively

- When there are multiple values for a certain row/group (see belowimage) you can now wrap up these values into a list. A definiteupgrade from `spread()/gather()` where this action was not possible.

An alternative to the above is to use `values_fn =` argument to specifya function to summarize a set of values in a column (such as taking the `mean()` of the three values),this may be the optimal strategy if you do not want list-columns everywhere in your data frame.

Some discussion followed on the `#TokyoR` hashtag as some questionedwhether the complicated gamut of arguments to the new `pivot_*()`functions differs from the tidyverse style of simple verbs describingthe user’s action. Others commented that the very messy nature of realworld data necessitates the extra layer of complexity in the`spread()/gather()/pivot_*()` functions.

It has been speculated that `tidyr 1.0.0` was going to be released by theuseR! Conference in early July, however more likely it will be the lateJuly if not early August. As this was only a 20 minute talk,`@yutannihilation` wasn’t able to talk about every change such asinformation regarding `specs` but I’ve listed resources for furtherreading below. Do keep in mind that the vignettes below are still in development andexplanations and examples may change.

## flaty13: RMarkdown Template for Analytics Teams!

`@flaty13`, who has previously presented at both `Tokyo.R` and`Japan.R`, gave a presentation on creating RMarkdown templates at hisworkplace. The usual workflow at his company is that those that use `R` knit a RMD into a`.html` file then upload it to their web server to share. However, everyteam member has a different level of expertise of RMarkdown and as suchit can be difficult for others to understand the structure and flow ofanother person’s report. To remedy this `@flaty13` decided to create aRMarkdown **template** for everybody to use!

One of the main differences that needed to be standardized was howpeople loaded packages as well as read in data so after a **“Summary”**section at the top the next two sections were:

- **“Preparation”** section: Loaded all the libraries, configured RMDoptions, and defined any custom functions

- **“Data Load & Check”** sections: Reads in all the data, does theprocessing and checking as well. This sections makes it clear **where**the data is coming from.

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/flaty13-1.PNG?w=350)


He also took advantage of the “Table of Contents”, “Code folding”, and“Tabset” options to create a report template that is easy to navigateand reduces the amount of clutter. These options were all called in viathe template’s YAML header:

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/flaty13-2.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/flaty13-2.PNG?w=350)


As a result of creating a standard template, `@flaty13` found that itbecame a lot easier to understand other team members’ reports and italso became easier for new employees to get integrated into theRMarkdown reports workflow.

## igjit: Creating images from RAW data using R!

`@igjit` has come to present at `Tokyo.R` yet again, cooking upanother interesting way to use R, this time for processing/editingimages from RAW data! RAW is a certain file format that captures**all** of the image data recorded by a camera’s sensor when youtake a photo. As no data is compressed in this format (compared tosay, a JPEG) you are able to get very high quality images. Oneadvantage of RAW is that it is able to record more levels ofbrightness (“bits”) which means you can make more adjustments interms of exposure, contrast, and brightness when producing yourimage.

To do this `@igjit` primarily used the `{imager}`, `{reticulate}`,`{tidyverse}` packages while also using the Python library `rawpy` toactually load the RAW data into R.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/igjit-1.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/igjit-1.PNG?w=350)


After loading in the data you can use functions from `{imager}` to editand process the image in different ways such as demosaic-ing and whitebalance editing.

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/igjit-2.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/igjit-2.PNG?w=350)


`@igjit` has created a `bookdown` of the how-to and various tutorials ofmanipulating RAW images with R which you can findhere!

In conclusion, `@igjit` talked about how R isn’t **just** a tool forstatistical work and it can be used for other tasks too! Also, frompursuing this project he realized that using R for RAW image processingcan be quite an advantage due to R’s non-standard evaluation capabilities,the `%>%`, and the ability to use vector operations on objects.

## soriente: R Coding Styles

At her first `Tokyo.R`, `@soriente`, talked about different R codingstyles. Coming from a PHP background she wondered if there were any“official” or certain guidelines in writing R code. The resource shecame across was Google’s StyleGuide.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/soriente-1.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/soriente-1.PNG?w=350)


One of the things she noted was that in R it doesn’t seem to matter ifyou wrap characters using single-quotes `'blah'` or double-quotes`"blahblah"` which was odd for her as a PHP person as in that languagethere is a significant difference. Another style guide many R usersmaybe familiar with is the tidyverse styleguide:

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup_files/soriente-2.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)

Below are some other resources for coding styles:

This month’s food & drinks was an Italian-themed dinner with anassortment of pasta and pizza available. With a loud rendition of“kampai!” (cheers!) R users from all over Tokyo began to talk abouttheir successes and struggles with R. A fun tradition at `TokyoR` is a**Rock-Paper-Scissors** tournament with the prize being **free** datascience books:

Unfortunately, there was an incident at the Rock-Paper-ScissorsTournament when there was some “booing” heard when the `Python` book wasannounced as one of the prizes. Although seemingly made in joking mannerit was still disrespectful not only to other Pythonistas at the meetupbut also to the person who took the time and effort to donate the bookfor this event. What was good to see was that the organizers and otherscame out to admonish this kind of behavior. In the time that I’ve beengoing to `Tokyo.R`, the meetup has always been very welcoming of peoplefrom all backgrounds including Python, Excel (many R users in Japan havebeen trying to move their companies away from Excel to mixed success…), etc.We have also had presentations featuring Python alongside R via`reticulate` in the past, including a presentation in this session!

Despite this blip, it was another educational and fun-filled `TokyoR`session where I again lost in the Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament in thefirst round… repeatedly. Someday I’ll win a book…someday! `TokyoR` happensalmost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle with Japanese R users asit’s the largest regular meetup here in Japan. Talks in English are alsowelcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
