A new online conference focused on cloud data technologies is coming this fall. It is not just a conference or webinar, it will be an interactive online platform. The focus of the event is***data in the cloud*** (migrating, storing and machine learning). You can pre-register for the conference now. 

Some of the topics from the summit include:
- Data Science
- IoT
- Streaming Data
- AI
- Data Visualization

Here is an excerpt from the website:

>  The public cloud has drastically changed systems design, enabled microservices, and lowered the barrier to entry for big data & analytics. Learn from companies which have migrated data platforms from on-premise to the cloud. See how they were redesigned to take advantage of endless storage and compute power. Immerse yourself with the platforms which make modern Data Science and Machine Learning possible. Join your peers to see how their data platforms knocked down the old barriers and transformed how they work 

What: Cloud Data SummitWhere: Online (a new conference platform)When: October 16-17, 2019How to pre-register: Register Online

I hope to see you there.
