The useR! Conference was held in Toulouse, France and for me thiswas my second useR! after my first in Brisbane last year. This timearound I wanted to write about my experiences and some highlightssimilar to my post on the RStudio::Conference 2019 & Tidyverse DevDayearlier this year. This blog post will be divided into 4 sections: **Programming**, **Shiny**, **{Packages}**, and **Touring Toulouse**.

You can find slides and videos (in a week or so) in:

As usual there were many talks that I didn’t get to go to as there arearound 3~5 tracks across different rooms featuring talks on a certainaspect of R such as Shiny, Modelling, Data handling, DevOps, Education,etc. In the coming weeks I’ll also add video links tothe presentations below when they become available from R Consortium’sYoutube channel.

Let’s begin!

## Enhancements to data tidying: Hadley Wickham

Acknowledging the difficulty of `spread()` and `gather()` you might have heard of the creation of the `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` functions in recentmonths. You really should take a look at the work-in-progressVignette for a comprehensive understanding of the new functions but thetalk featured some live-coding by Hadley(Code)and some cool spread/gather animations via Charco Hui’s masters’thesis.

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/wide-long.gif?w=450)


For more material you might be interested in Hiroaki Yutani’s tidyr1.0.0 presentationfrom June’s Tokyo.R meetup. It’s mainly in Japanese but there are lotsof code and explanatory graphics that may aid you in visualizing how thenew functions work. You can also read a short English summary of thetalk here.

## n() cool dplyr things: Romain Francois

Taking the tidy data principles into account but for **grouped data**,Romain Francois talked about the new `group_*()` functions in the{dplyr} package.

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-hug.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-hug.PNG?w=450)


While in previous versions of {dplyr} working in a tidy manner withgroups was done with `group_by()` then `dplyr::do()`, the latterfunction has been deprecated and have been largely replaced by the{purrr} family of functions instead. In this context the `group_map()`,`group_modify()`, and `group_walk()` functions iterate like the {purrr}functions but instead over groups. You can apply the functions you wantto apply to each group inline via a lambda, `~` (as below), or you canspecify a function directly without the lambda.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-map.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-map.PNG?w=350)


The `group_split()` operates similarly to `base::split()` but splits bygroups, the output being a list of sliced groups. The `group_keys()`function returns you the exact grouping structure of the data you used`group_by()` on, allowing you to check that the structure is rightbefore you start applying functions on your data. `group_data()` and`group_rows()` gives you different kind of information about yourgrouped data as can be seen below.


![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-data.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-data.PNG?w=49%25)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-rows.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/group-rows.PNG?w=49%25)




To shorten the `group_by() %>% summarize()` workflow you could insteaduse the `summarize_at()` function. You can select specific columns with`vars()`, then actions via a lambda, `~`, and you can specify multiplefunctions with `list()`.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/summarize-at.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/summarize-at.PNG?w=450)


Romain also talked about the {dance} package which is mainly used to experiment and test out possible new {dplyr} functions by leveraging therelatively new {vctrs} and {rlang} packages’ features. The package has a theme of using famous dance moves as the function names!

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/dance-pkg.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/dance-pkg.PNG?w=450)


## Reusing tidyverse code – Lionel Henry

Lionel Henry talked about programming using {tidyverse} functions. As anintroduction he went over data masking in {dplyr} and how it isoptimized for interactive coding and single-use `%>%`s. The usage ofnon-standard evaluation (NSE) makes analyses easy as you can focus on the data rather than thedata structure. However, we hit a stumbling block when it comes to whenwe want to create custom functions to program with {dplyr}. This is thedifference between computing in the work space (as needed) versuscomputing in a data mask.


![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/data-mask.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/data-mask.PNG?w=49%25)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/data-mask2.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/data-mask2.PNG?w=49%25)




This is where `tidyeval` comes into play via {rlang} for flexible and robust programming in the tidyverse. However {rlang} confused a lot ofpeople due to the strange new syntax it introduced such as the `!!`,`!!!`, and `enquo()`. Also, it introduced new concepts such asquasi-quotation and quosures that made it hard to learn for peopleespecially with those without a programming background. Acknowledgingthis obstacle, `was introduced to make creating tidyevalfunctions easier. The new` (read as “curly-curly”) operator wasinspired by the {glue} package and is a short cut for `!!enquo(var)`.

## Keynote #2: Shiny apps and Reproducibility – Joe Cheng

Compared to a R script or R Markdown document, reproducibility suffersin Shiny apps as the outputs are transient and **not** archivable.RStudio’s Joe Cheng talked about how reproducible analysis with Shiny is inconvenient as reenacting theuser’s interaction steps is necessary. A case for having a simple**CLICK** button to view/download a reproducible artifact can be seen invarious industries such as:

- ex. Drug research/pharma validation (workflow)

- ex. Teaching: statistical concepts and code snippets

- ex. Gadgets/add-ins: building `ggplots`, regex, and SQL queries theninsert the code into source/console editor


The different possible outputs we might want from a Shiny app are:

- To download the RMD or R file as the artifact

- To download a ZIP with source code & data, other supporting files,and the actual rendered result


From there Joe talks about how there are a number of options availablesuch as :

Copy-paste: Have a Shiny app **and** RMD report

1. Pros: Copy-pasted code is high fidelity and easy to understand

1. Cons: Two copies must be kept in sync and method will not work formore dynamic apps



1. Lexical analysis: automatically generate scripts from app sourcecode (static analysis and heuristics)

- Pros: Easy to add to app

- Cons: Not ALL apps can be translated automatically

- Generated code may **not** be camera ready as it may contain lots ofcode relating to the Shiny app’s structure


- Pros: Flexible

- Cons: **High** learning curve and significant effort needed to adaptold Shiny apps


In light of the various pros and cons of the above options Joe with thehelp of Carson Sievert created the…

### {shinymeta} package

There are four main steps to follow when using {shinymeta}:

1. Identify the domain logic inside the code and separate it fromShiny’s reactive structure

- Activate meta mode with `withMetaMode()` or `expandChain()`

- Use `metaReactive()` to create a `reactive()` that returns a codeexpression

- Other functions to return code include `metaObserve()`,`metaRender()`, etc.

- You can also wrap the code you want with `metaExpr()` insidefunction


![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta.PNG?w=450)


1. Within the domain logic you identified, identify references toreactive values and expressions that need to be replaced with staticvalues and static code

- De-reference reactive values with `!!`

- Replace reactive values with the **actual** values


![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta2.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta2.PNG?w=450)


1. At run time, choose **which** pieces of domain logic to expose tothe user

- `expandChain()`: turns `!!` code into variable and introduces codesnippet above the function

- The chain of variable declarations grow upwards as you sequentiallyexpand the meta-objects


![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta3.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta3.PNG?w=450)


Present the code to the user!

1. Use `outputCodeButton()` to add a button for a specific output

1. Use `displayCodeModal()` to display underlying code

1. Use `downloadButton()` to allow people to click and download a Rscript or RMD report

1. Use `buildScriptBundle` or `buidlRmdBundle()` to generate .zipbundles dynamically




![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta4.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymeta4.PNG?w=450)


Some of the limitations and future directions Joe, Carson, and the restof the Shiny team acknowledge are that:

- The formatting of the code can be improved (whitespace not preserved)

- Future compatibility with Shiny async

- So far {shinymeta} only covers reproducing “snapshots” of the appstate

- More work and thinking needs to be done to reproduce a “notebook”style record of the how/why/what of the multiple iterations ofinteractive usage that was needed to get to a certain result andoutput


There’s a lot to take in (this was probably the toughest talk for me toexplain in this post…), so besides watching the keynotetalk yourself youcan also take a look at the shinymeta packagewebsite.

## {golem}: Shiny apps in production – Vincent Guyader

Vincent Guyader, from another French R organizationThinkR, talked about the new {golem}package which creates a nice framework for building robustproduction-ready Shiny apps.

One of the key principles in R is when you are repeatedly writing orusing the same code or functions then you should write a package, andthis is no different for Shiny apps as well. The reasons Vincent statedwere:

- Easy dependency, version, documentation management

- Easy installation and deployment


![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/golem.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/golem.PNG?w=450)


With the package infrastructure, you need to have the `ui.R` and`server.R` (`app_ui.R` and `app_server.R` respectively in {golem}) inthe R directory and all you need to run your app is the `run_app()`function.

{golem} also has functions that make it easy to deploy your app via RStudio Connect, shinyproxy, Shiny server, heroku, etc.

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/golemDeploy.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/golemDeploy.PNG?w=450)


For styling your app with customized JavaScript and CSS files you caneasily add them to your Shiny app package directory via the`add_js_file()` and `add_css_file()` functions. You can do similar butwith modules with `add_module()`. As {golem} is a package you have allthe great attributes of an R package available to you such as unittesting, documentation, and continuous integration/deployment!

## Our journey with Shiny: Some packages to enhance your applications – Victor Perrier & Fanny Meyer

Victor Perrier and Fanny Meyer from dreamRs talked aboutthe various Shiny packages that can extend the functionality of yourShiny applications!

The first and probably the most well-known of this group is the{shinyWidgets} package which gives you a variety of cool custom widgets that you can add to make your Shiny app via JavaScript and CSS.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinywidgets.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinywidgets.PNG?w=350)


Next, wondering about how exactly users interacted with their Shiny appsand whether they used the included widgets the dreamRs team created the{shinylogs} package. This packages records any and all inputs that are changed as well as the outputs and errors. This is done by storing theJavaScript objects via thelocalForage JavaScriptlibrary. With this in place shiny developers can see the number ofconnections per day, the user agent family, most viewed tabs, etc.

The {shinybusy} package gives a user feedback when a server operation running or busy such as a spinning circle, a moving bar, or even anykind of gif you choose!

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinybusy-gif.gif?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinybusy-gif.gif?w=450)


Last but not least is the {shinymanager} package which allows you to administrate and manage who can access your application and protects the source code of your app until authentication is successful!

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymanager.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/shinymanager.PNG?w=350)


The dreamRs organization are also the organization that created the{esquisse} package that lets you interactively make ggplot2 graphs with an RStudio addin!

Talking about packages leads me to the next section…

## Summary of developments in R’s data.table package – Arun Srinivasan

I’ve been curious about data.table so I decided to go to this talkto learn more from Arun Srinivasan, one of the authors of the package. Starting offwith some trivia, I finally learned that the reason for the seal on thehex sticker is because seals make an “aR! aR! aR!” sound according to{data.table} creator Matt Dowle, which I thought was pretty great!

Compared to a year ago there has been a lot of change and progress in{data.table}:

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableNOW.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableNOW.PNG?w=350)


A key principle of {data.table} is that there are **no** dependencies orimports in the package!

The general form of using {data.table} is as follows:

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableFORM.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableFORM.PNG?w=450)


Arun also showed us some examples:


![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx1.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx1.PNG?w=49%25)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx1-1.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx1-1.PNG?w=49%25)





![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx2.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx2.PNG?w=49%25)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx2-1.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableEx2-1.PNG?w=49%25)




At the end he also talked about the new optimization and functionalitiesin the package.

- for ‘i’: auto-indexing and parallel subsets (columns processed inparallel)

- for ‘j’: using GForce

- for ‘by’: parallelization of radix ordering

- new functionality: `froll()`, `coalesce()`, and `nafill()`


![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableOPT.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/datatableOPT.PNG?w=350)


At the end of the talk Arun thanked the 69 people (among them MichaelChirico, Philippe Chataignon, Jan Gorecki, etc.) who have contributed alot to what {data.table} is today!

## {polite} – Dmytro Perepolkin

The {polite} package is one I’ve been used for over a year now (youmight’ve seen me use it in my soccer or TV data viz) and I was delightedto hear that the creator was giving a LT on it! Dmytro began with a few do’s and don’ts concerning user-agents and being explicit about them:

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/polite1.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/polite1.PNG?w=450)


Secondly, you should always check the `robots.txt` for the website which is a file thatstipulates various conditions for scraping activity. This can be donevia Peter Meissner’s {robotstxt} package or by checking the output from `polite::bow("theWebsiteYouAreScraping.com")`(`polite::bow()` functionis what establishes the {polite} session)!

After getting permission you also need to limit the rate at which youscrape, you don’t want to overload the servers of the website you areusing, so **no** parallelization! This can be done with the {ratelimitr}package, `purrr::slowly()` while the {polite} package automaticallydelays by 5 seconds when you run `polite::scrape()`.

After scraping, you should definitely cache your responses with {memoise}, which is what is used inside the `polite::scrape()` function. Also, wrap your scraper functionwith something like `purrr:::safely()` so it returns a list of twocomponents, a “result” for successes and “error” object for errors inyour scraping.

You can also read his blog post on the talkhere which explains abit more about the `polite::use_manners()` function that allows you toinclude {polite} scrapers into your own R packages.

## goodpractice: good pkg development Hannah Frick

Hannah Frick from Mango Solutions talked about {goodpractice}, a package that gives you advice about good practices for building an R package. Byrunning `goodpractice::gp()` it does static code analysis and can runaround ~200 of the checks available.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/goodpractice.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/goodpractice.PNG?w=450)


A cool thing you can do is that you can customize the different checksit runs, set your own standards beforehand and run the checks based onthose standards with the `make_check()` and `make_prep()` functions.It’s a great package that I’ve used before at work and for my ownpackages so definitely try it out!

## The development of {datos} package for the R4DS Spanish translation – Riva Quiroga

Riva Quiroga talked about translatingthe “R for Data Science” book and R data sets into Spanish. This cameabout as a fact that learning R (or any programming language) can betough for a non-English speaker as it means you have to not only learnthe programming but figuring out what the documentation and use cases inEnglish even mean. To address this language gap the R4DS Spanishtranslation community project was born, Ciencia deDatos on Github! Through Github andslack the organization sought to translate both the book and the variousdata sets available in base R, for example: turning “diamonds” into “dimantes”.However, they found that simply trying to `rename()` everything was notsustainable so they had to find an alternative. This alternative endedup being the {datalang}package.

This package (created by RStudio’s Edgar Ruiz) uses a YAML spec filetranslating to the language you want for the variable names, valuenames, help files, etc. After creating the spec file you just have toadd it as an argument into the`datalang::translate_data()/translate_folder()` function and you’ll havea translated data set! The R para Ciencia de Datos Twitter also hosts a Spanish version of #TidyTuesday called #DatosDeMiercoles so check itout!

Another thought I had after this presentation was that maybe this mightbe a good idea for Japanese?

## R Consortium Working Groups – Joseph Rickert

RStudio’s Joe Rickert talked about RConsortium’s Workings Groups which is an initiative to foster innovationamong individuals and companies. Any individual or a group can apply tocreate a working group to explore what R and other technologies can doin a certain field of interest. Throughout the talk Joe gave examples ofsuccessful workings groups such as:

As advice for potential working groups Joe said that one should pick aproject with a very **wide** scope which can benefit from collaborationbetween members and which can benefit a large portion of the Rcommunity.

## Keynote: #3 ‘AI for Good’ in the R and Python ecosystems – Julien Cornebise

In the last keynote of the conference Julien Cornebise talked about using technology tools for good using lots of examples throughout hislife for both good and bad projects.

Here are some quotes I was able to jot down:

On using technology for good:

> 
“Technology is not a solution it is an accelerator, essentially you just have a better optimizer, you’re just fitting better to the incentives we have around us a society.”


On the motivation of getting involved in #DataForGood projects:

> 
“Are you here to solve the problem or are you here for a really cool application of your fantastic new theory and algorithm?”


On “hackathon syndrome” of many solutions to #DataForGood problems:

> 
“Github is a big cemetary of really good ideas … where do we find software engineers, where do we find the designers, how do we go from the solution to the project to a real product that can be used by many many people?”


![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/AIforGood1.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-07-21-user2019-reflections_files/AIforGood1.PNG?w=450)


Some of the projects he talked about were:

- DecodeDarfur:Identifying remote burnt/destroyed villages in the Darfur region toprovide credible evidence that they had been attacked by theSudanese government and allies.

- TrollPatrol:Quantitative analysis of online abuse and violence against UK and USwomen on Twitter.


This is definitely a talk I would recommend everybody to watch and youcan do so from here!

As I was only heading home on the following Monday, I had the entireweekend to explore Toulouse! I was staying near the Capitole and asToulouse is pretty walkable I didn’t have to use public transportationat all during my stay. I think I just about walked every street in thecity center!

Sunday was also Bastille Day so there were some fireworks on display aswell. All in all I had a great time in Toulouse!

This was my second useR! Conference and I enjoyed it quite a lot, not tomention I got to do some sightseeing which I wasn’t able to do much ofin Brisbane last year. I met a lot of people that I follow on Twitterand I’ve had people come up to me who recognized me from all the dataviz/blog posts I do (a first for me) which was really cool (and it helpsas I’m very nervous about approaching people especially since they areusually surrounded by other people and I don’t want to interrupt theirconversation and… “Oh no it’s time for the next session!”, etc.)!

During a post-conference dinner I had with a dozen or so randomR users that were still in Toulouse (including Diane Cook, Will Chase, Saras Windecker, Irene Steves, Alimi Eyitayo among others – and some that I didn’t even get to talk to because our group was so big) we all talked about how important the**community** is. With how open everything is in regards to the talksbeing recorded and the materials being put online you don’t necessarilyhave to come all the way to the conference to be able to **learn** the material.However, the important component of these conferences is being able to talk to the people and engaging with the community whichis something I’ve really felt to be a part of since I started R andgoing to conferences in the past 2 years or so. I think nearly each oneof the people I sat with on the table at dinner that night came from adifferent country and worked in completely different areas which madefor some real eye-opening discussion about how R is used worldwide and across industries. Ialso learned about cultural differences in tech, especially women in techin Nigeria from Alimi Eyitayo (whoalso gave a talk on Scaling useR Communities with Engagement andRetentionModels at theconference).

There were still a ton of great talks I missed so I’m excited to watch the rest on Youtube. I think I will be at RStudio::Conference next year in San Francisco so hopefully I’ll see some of you there!
