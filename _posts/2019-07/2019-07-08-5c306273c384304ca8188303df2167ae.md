This morning swephR version 0.2.1 madeit unto CRAN and is nowpropagating to the mirrors.

The goal of swephR is to provide an R interface to theSwiss Ephemeris, ahigh precision ephemeris based upon the DE431 ephemeris from NASA’sJPL. It covers the time range 13201 BCE to 17191 CE.

This new version comes closely after last week’s releaseand contains only a single albeit important fix to a stack overflow writefound by the UBSAN tests done on CRAN. Sadly I did not find this error using`rhub::check_with_sanitizers()` before uploading to CRAN. I will analyze thisfurther before the next upload, since I fear that other issues like this mightsurface as we expose more of the Swiss Ephemeris to R.
