Once I found this great R package that really improves on the dplyr summary() function it was a game changer. 

This library allows for the best summary statistics for each variable grouped by a categorical variable. It can also be saved as a list with an assignment. 

Simply use datatable$column that is the categorical variable then use the map function to run summary. And that’s it! All set to produce results like these: 

You’ll have to do some formatting, or export to excel ! So fast and easy with this one.
