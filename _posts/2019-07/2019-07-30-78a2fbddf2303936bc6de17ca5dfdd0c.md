Microsoft Machine Learning Server, the enhanced deployment platform for R and Python applications, has been updated to version 9.4. This update includes the open source R 3.5.2 and Python 3.7.1 engines, and supports integration with Spark 2.4. Microsoft ML Server also includes specialized R packages and Python modules focused on application deployment, scalable machine learning, and integration with SQL Server.

Microsoft Machine Learning Server is used by organizations that need to use R and/or Python code in production applications. For some examples of deployments, take a look at these open-source solution templates for credit risk estimation, energy demand forecasting, fraud detection and many other applications.
