The tabr package for creating guitar tablature (“tabs”) from R code is now available on CRAN. `tabr` provides programmatic music notation and a wrapper around LilyPond for creating quality guitar tablature.

This post is just a quick update to mention that v0.3.0 has now been released on CRAN. And since I don’t have much time for blogging, I’m basically just pasting the release notes here below.

But the key changes are these:

- Make fretbaord plots with ggplot.

- Much more robust note/phrase/chord syntax validation.

- A collection of music programming functions have been added for more easily transforming among scales, modes, keys, chords, notes, etc.

- Custom print methods that use a splash of color.

- A table containing thousands of guitar chords and associated functions for mapping chords.

- A bunch more vignettes! Yay, happy vignettes!

- Bug fixes


- Added `fretboard_plot` for making fretboard diagrams outside of the LilyPond tablature pipeline. This necessitates importing `ggplot2`.

- Added functions for phrase validation, coercion and decomposition back to original character string inputs.

- Added functions for note, pitch, chord and octave equivalence checks.

- Added a collection of functions for constructing and working with common chords. The chord constructors are among the `chord_*`-named functions and also have shorter `x*`-named aliases. These are “piano chords,” i.e., based on the condensed, defining intervals.

- Added `guitarChords` dataset containing several thousand formations of guitar chord voicings.

- Added helper functions that use `guitarChords` for obtaining guitar chord information and mapping between different defining properties of a chord, most notably the addition of `gc_notes` and `gc_fretboard` for mapping chord names to noteworthy strings and fretboard diagram syntax.

- Added helper functions for working with basic note/pitch strings.

- Added helper functions for working with musical scales and modes.

- Added helper functions for working with musical intervals.

- Added `noteworthy` class, used internally, optional for users (includes custom print and summary methods).

- Added `mainIntervals` dataset.

- Added more internal checks of note and chord syntax validity across functions that work with string representations (pre-`phrase` object construction).

- Update older functions to utilize the new, more robust and stricter validation checks and offer more consistent `noteworthy` class output.

- updated `transpose` to handle additional edge cases, including a new style option, `strip`.

- Updated and added new unit tests.

- Bug fix for case where `NA`-valued no-chord rests (`s` or `r`) were unnamed in output of `chord_set`.

- Fixed entry in `tabrSyntax`.

- Fix class assignment bug and updated `as_phrase`.

- Added a new column of relative interval size to internal `.keydata` helper table.

- Added new vignettes focusing on the programming aspect of `tabr`.

- Updated documentation.
