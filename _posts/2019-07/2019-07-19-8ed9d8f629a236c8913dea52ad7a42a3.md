If you are like me, and rather last minute about making a plan to get the most out of a large conference, you are just starting to think about JSM 2019 which will begin in just a few days. My plans always begin with an attempt to sleuth out the R-related sessions. While in the past it took quite a bit of work to identify talks that were likely backed by R-based calculations, this is clearly no longer the case. In fact, because Stanford Professor Trevor Hastie will be delivering the prestigious Wald Lectures this year, R-backed work will be front and center.

Professor Hastie has made numerous, important contributions to statistical learning, machine learning, data science and statistical computing. Among the latter, is the `glmnet` package he co-authored with Jerome Friedman, Rob Tibshirani, Noah Simon, Balasubramanian Narasimhan and Junyang Qian which has become a fundamental resource.

The Wald Lectures will be delivered over three days in room CC Four Seasons 1 according to the following schedule:* Lecture 1: Mon, 7/29/2019, 10:30 AM – 12:20 PM* Lecture 2: Tue, 7/30/2019, 2:00 PM – 3:50 PM* Lecture 3: Wed, 7/31/2019, 10:30 AM – 12:20 PM

If you want to do some preparation for the lectures, you might have a look at the book *Statistical Learnig with Sparsity; The Lasso and Generalizations* by Hastie, Tibshirani and Wainwright.

The rest of this post lists some R-related talks that can help you fill your days at JSM! I am sure my list is not complete. Please feel free to add anything I may have missed to the comments section following this post.

### Supplementary Code

In case you are wondering how I produced the plot above, here is the code which uses the `cranly` and `dlstats` packages to investigate CRAN.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(cranly)
library(dlstats)
# Get clean copy of CRAN
p_db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
package_db <- clean_CRAN_db(p_db)
# Build package network
package_network <- build_network(package_db)

# Find Hastie packages
pkgs <- package_by(package_network, "Trevor Hastie")
# Find most downloaded Hastie packages
dstats <- cran_stats(pkgs)
topdown <- group_by(dstats,package) %>% 
 summarize(n=sum(downloads)) %>% 
 arrange(desc(n)) %>% filter(n > 100000)

# Plot the monthly downloads for Hastie's top 5 packages
shortlist <- select(topdown,package) %>% slice(1:5) 
toppkgs <- cran_stats(as.vector(shortlist$package))

ggplot(toppkgs, aes(end, downloads, group=package, color=package)) +
 geom_line() + geom_point(aes(shape=package)) + xlab("Monthly Downloads") + ggtitle("Trevor Hastie Packages")
```
