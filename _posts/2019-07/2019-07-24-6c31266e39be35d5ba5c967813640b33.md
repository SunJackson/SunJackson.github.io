Data scientists and data engineers who need to work with sensitive data should be familiar with using secrets, such as:

User credentials
API keys
Access tokens
SSH keys
pem files, etc

One of the primary uses of secrets is to secure access to systems and data, but theyâ€™re also used to sign cookies, encrypt data, protect the network, and more. While a lone user can manage their own secrets fairly well, sharing secrets between a team of data scientists and engineers has always been problematic.

But what if sharing secrets was as quick and easy as using Slack or email, but far more secure? Learn how to incorporate security into your practices without slowing down your project. Read the blog post to learn more.
