**QoE-Aware Resource Allocation for Crowdsourced Live Streaming: A Machine Learning Approach**

Driven by the tremendous technological advancement of personal devices and the prevalence of wireless mobile network accesses, the world has witnessed an explosion in crowdsourced live streaming. Ensuring a better viewers quality of experience (QoE) is the key to maximize the audiences number and increase streaming providers’ profits. This can be achieved by advocating a geo-distributed cloud infrastructure to allocate the multimedia resources as close as possible to viewers, in order to minimize the access delay and video stalls. Moreover, allocating the exact needed resources beforehand avoids over-provisioning, which may lead to significant costs by the service providers. In the contrary, under-provisioning might cause significant delays to the viewers. In this paper, we introduce a prediction driven resource allocation framework, to maximize the QoE of viewers and minimize the resource allocation cost. First, by exploiting the viewers locations available in our unique dataset, we implement a machine learning model to predict the viewers number near each geo-distributed cloud site. Second, based on the predicted results that showed to be close to the actual values, we formulate an optimization problem to proactively allocate resources at the viewers proximity. Additionally, we will present a trade-off between the video access delay and the cost of resource allocation.

**Finding Needles in a Moving Haystack: Prioritizing Alerts with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning**

Detection of malicious behavior is a fundamental problem in security. One of the major challenges in using detection systems in practice is in dealing with an overwhelming number of alerts that are triggered by normal behavior (the so-called false positives), obscuring alerts resulting from actual malicious activity. While numerous methods for reducing the scope of this issue have been proposed, ultimately one must still decide how to prioritize which alerts to investigate, and most existing prioritization methods are heuristic, for example, based on suspiciousness or priority scores. We introduce a novel approach for computing a policy for prioritizing alerts using adversarial reinforcement learning. Our approach assumes that the attackers know the full state of the detection system and dynamically choose an optimal attack as a function of this state, as well as of the alert prioritization policy. The first step of our approach is to capture the interaction between the defender and attacker in a game theoretic model. To tackle the computational complexity of solving this game to obtain a dynamic stochastic alert prioritization policy, we propose an adversarial reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, we use neural reinforcement learning to compute best response policies for both the defender and the adversary to an arbitrary stochastic policy of the other. We then use these in a double-oracle framework to obtain an approximate equilibrium of the game, which in turn yields a robust stochastic policy for the defender. Extensive experiments using case studies in fraud and intrusion detection demonstrate that our approach is effective in creating robust alert prioritization policies.

**Performance Comparison Between OpenCV Built in CPU and GPU Functions on Image Processing Operations**

Image Processing is a specialized area of Digital Signal Processing which contains various mathematical and algebraic operations such as matrix inversion, transpose of matrix, derivative, convolution, Fourier Transform etc. Operations like those require higher computational capabilities than daily usage purposes of computers. At that point, with increased image sizes and more complex operations, CPUs may be unsatisfactory since they use Serial Processing by default. GPUs are the solution that come up with greater speed compared to CPUs because of their Parallel Processing/Computation nature. A parallel computing platform and programming model named CUDA was created by NVIDIA and implemented by the graphics processing units (GPUs) which were produced by them. In this paper, computing performance of some commonly used Image Processing operations will be compared on OpenCV’s built in CPU and GPU functions that use CUDA.

**Horizon Visibility Graphs and Time Series Merge Trees are Dual**

In this paper we introduce the horizon visibility graph, a simple extension to the popular horizontal visibility graph representation of a time series, and show that it possesses a rigorous mathematical foundation in computational algebraic topology. This fills a longstanding gap in the literature on the horizontal visibility approach to nonlinear time series analysis which, despite a suite of successful applications across multiple domains, lacks a formal setting in which to prove general properties and develop natural extensions. The main finding is that horizon visibility graphs are dual to merge trees arising naturally over a filtered complex associated to a time series, while horizontal visibility graphs are weak duals of these trees. Immediate consequences include availability of tree-based reconstruction theorems, connections to results on the statistics of self-similar trees, and relations between visibility graphs and the emerging field of applied persistent homology.

**One-vs-All Models for Asynchronous Training: An Empirical Analysis**

Any given classification problem can be modeled using multi-class or One-vs-All (OVA) architecture. An OVA system consists of as many OVA models as the number of classes, providing the advantage of asynchrony, where each OVA model can be re-trained independent of other models. This is particularly advantageous in settings where scalable model training is a consideration (for instance in an industrial environment where multiple and frequent updates need to be made to the classification system). In this paper, we conduct empirical analysis on realizing independent updates to OVA models and its impact on the accuracy of the overall OVA system. Given that asynchronous updates lead to differences in training datasets for OVA models, we first define a metric to quantify the differences in datasets. Thereafter, using Natural Language Understanding as a task of interest, we estimate the impact of three factors: (i) number of classes, (ii) number of data points and, (iii) divergences in training datasets across OVA models; on the OVA system accuracy. Finally, we observe the accuracy impact of increased asynchrony in a Spoken Language Understanding system. We analyze the results and establish that the proposed metric correlates strongly with the model performances in both the experimental settings.

**Bayesian Optimisation over Multiple Continuous and Categorical Inputs**

Efficient optimisation of black-box problems that comprise both continuous and categorical inputs is important, yet poses significant challenges. We propose a new approach, Continuous and Categorical Bayesian Optimisation (CoCaBO), which combines the strengths of multi-armed bandits and Bayesian optimisation to select values for both categorical and continuous inputs. We model this mixed-type space using a Gaussian Process kernel, designed to allow sharing of information across multiple categorical variables, each with multiple possible values; this allows CoCaBO to leverage all available data efficiently. We extend our method to the batch setting and propose an efficient selection procedure that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation whilst encouraging batch diversity. We demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world optimisation tasks with continuous and categorical inputs.

**Placeto: Learning Generalizable Device Placement Algorithms for Distributed Machine Learning**

We present Placeto, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to efficiently find device placements for distributed neural network training. Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1x fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.

**Quantum-Inspired Support Vector Machine**

Support vector machine (SVM) is a particularly powerful and flexible supervised learning model that analyze data for both classification and regression, whose usual complexity scales polynomially with the dimension and number of data points. Inspired by the quantum SVM, we present a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for SVM using fast sampling techniques. In our approach, we develop a general method to approximately calculate the kernel function and make classification via carefully sampling the data matrix, thus our approach can be applied to various types of SVM, such as linear SVM, poly-kernel SVM and soft SVM. Theoretical analysis shows one can find the supported hyperplanes on a data set which we have sampling access, and thus make classification with arbitrary success probability in logarithmic runtime, matching the runtime of the quantum SVM.

**Meta-learning of textual representations**

Recent progress in AutoML has lead to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., AutoSKLearn) that can be readily used by non-experts to approach any supervised learning problem. Whereas these methods are quite effective, they are still limited in the sense that they work for tabular (matrix formatted) data only. This paper describes one step forward in trying to automate the design of supervised learning methods in the context of text mining. We introduce a meta learning methodology for automatically obtaining a representation for text mining tasks starting from raw text. We report experiments considering 60 different textual representations and more than 80 text mining datasets associated to a wide variety of tasks. Experimental results show the proposed methodology is a promising solution to obtain highly effective off the shell text classification pipelines.

**Mitigating Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing: Literature Review**

As Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in popularity, it becomes increasingly vital to recognize the role they play in shaping societal biases and stereotypes. Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.

**Database Meets Deep Learning: Challenges and Opportunities**

Deep learning has recently become very popular on account of its incredible success in many complex data-driven applications, such as image classification and speech recognition. The database community has worked on data-driven applications for many years, and therefore should be playing a lead role in supporting this new wave. However, databases and deep learning are different in terms of both techniques and applications. In this paper, we discuss research problems at the intersection of the two fields. In particular, we discuss possible improvements for deep learning systems from a database perspective, and analyze database applications that may benefit from deep learning techniques.

**A Comparative Survey of Recent Natural Language Interfaces for Databases**

Over the last few years natural language interfaces (NLI) for databases have gained significant traction both in academia and industry. These systems use very different approaches as described in recent survey papers. However, these systems have not been systematically compared against a set of benchmark questions in order to rigorously evaluate their functionalities and expressive power. In this paper, we give an overview over 24 recently developed NLIs for databases. Each of the systems is evaluated using a curated list of ten sample questions to show their strengths and weaknesses. We categorize the NLIs into four groups based on the methodology they are using: keyword-, pattern-, parsing-, and grammar-based NLI. Overall, we learned that keyword-based systems are enough to answer simple questions. To solve more complex questions involving subqueries, the system needs to apply some sort of parsing to identify structural dependencies. Grammar-based systems are overall the most powerful ones, but are highly dependent on their manually designed rules. In addition to providing a systematic analysis of the major systems, we derive lessons learned that are vital for designing NLIs that can answer a wide range of user questions.

**Backpropagation-Friendly Eigendecomposition**

Eigendecomposition (ED) is widely used in deep networks. However, the backpropagation of its results tends to be numerically unstable, whether using ED directly or approximating it with the Power Iteration method, particularly when dealing with large matrices. While this can be mitigated by partitioning the data in small and arbitrary groups, doing so has no theoretical basis and makes its impossible to exploit the power of ED to the full. In this paper, we introduce a numerically stable and differentiable approach to leveraging eigenvectors in deep networks. It can handle large matrices without requiring to split them. We demonstrate the better robustness of our approach over standard ED and PI for ZCA whitening, an alternative to batch normalization, and for PCA denoising, which we introduce as a new normalization strategy for deep networks, aiming to further denoise the network’s features.

**BERT-based Financial Sentiment Index and LSTM-based Stock Return Predictability**

Traditional sentiment construction in finance relies heavily on the dictionary-based approach, with a few exceptions using simple machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes classifier. While the current literature has not yet invoked the rapid advancement in the natural language processing, we construct in this research a textual-based sentiment index using a novel model BERT recently developed by Google, especially for three actively trading individual stocks in Hong Kong market with hot discussion on Weibo.com. On the one hand, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of applying BERT in sentiment analysis when compared with existing models. On the other hand, by combining with the other two existing methods commonly used on building the sentiment index in the financial literature, i.e., option-implied and market-implied approaches, we propose a more general and comprehensive framework for financial sentiment analysis, and further provide convincing outcomes for the predictability of individual stock return for the above three stocks using LSTM (with a feature of a nonlinear mapping), in contrast to the dominating econometric methods in sentiment influence analysis that are all of a nature of linear regression.

**Evolution Attack On Neural Networks**

Many studies have been done to prove the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial example. A trained and well-behaved model can be fooled by a visually imperceptible perturbation, i.e., an originally correctly classified image could be misclassified after a slight perturbation. In this paper, we propose a black-box strategy to attack such networks using an evolution algorithm. First, we formalize the generation of an adversarial example into the optimization problem of perturbations that represent the noise added to an original image at each pixel. To solve this optimization problem in a black-box way, we find that an evolution algorithm perfectly meets our requirement since it can work without any gradient information. Therefore, we test various evolution algorithms, including a simple genetic algorithm, a parameter-exploring policy gradient, an OpenAI evolution strategy, and a covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy. Experimental results show that a covariance matrix adaptive evolution Strategy performs best in this optimization problem. Additionally, we also perform several experiments to explore the effect of different regularizations on improving the quality of an adversarial example.

**Explainable Fact Checking with Probabilistic Answer Set Programming**

One challenge in fact checking is the ability to improve the transparency of the decision. We present a fact checking method that uses reference information in knowledge graphs (KGs) to assess claims and explain its decisions. KGs contain a formal representation of knowledge with semantic descriptions of entities and their relationships. We exploit such rich semantics to produce interpretable explanations for the fact checking output. As information in a KG is inevitably incomplete, we rely on logical rule discovery and on Web text mining to gather the evidence to assess a given claim. Uncertain rules and facts are turned into logical programs and the checking task is modeled as an inference problem in a probabilistic extension of answer set programs. Experiments show that the probabilistic inference enables the efficient labeling of claims with interpretable explanations, and the quality of the results is higher than state of the art baselines.

**Theory of the Frequency Principle for General Deep Neural Networks**

Along with fruitful applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to realistic problems, recently, some empirical studies of DNNs reported a universal phenomenon of Frequency Principle (F-Principle): a DNN tends to learn a target function from low to high frequencies during the training. The F-Principle has been very useful in providing both qualitative and quantitative understandings of DNNs. In this paper, we rigorously investigate the F-Principle for the training dynamics of a general DNN at three stages: initial stage, intermediate stage, and final stage. For each stage, a theorem is provided in terms of proper quantities characterizing the F-Principle. Our results are general in the sense that they work for multilayer networks with general activation functions, population densities of data, and a large class of loss functions. Our work lays a theoretical foundation of the F-Principle for a better understanding of the training process of DNNs.
