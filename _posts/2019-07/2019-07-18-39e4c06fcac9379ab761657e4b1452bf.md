Several dozen people have taken part in RStudio’s instructor training and certification program since it was announced earlier this year. Since our last update, many of them have completed certification, so we are pleased to announce a preview of our trainers’ directory. Each of the people listed there has completed an exam on modern evidence-based teaching practices, as well as technical exams on the Tidyverse or Shiny, and they would welcome inquiries from anyone who is looking for high-quality training on these topics.

We plan to fold this directory into the main RStudio website in the near future, and would be grateful for comments about how to make it more useful. We are also now taking applications for instructor training in September and October 2019; if you are interested, you can find details here or register here. If you have questions or suggestions, please email Greg Wilson.
