In the previous posts we have seen how easy it is to price interest rate swapsusing R. I am honoured to announce that I have decided to put all the functionsI have described together into a package that is called…SwapPricer!

Ok, the name is not super original, but it should at least be easy to remember.

You can install it as follows:

```
# library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("DavideMagno/SwapPricer")
```

The package is still unfortunately not on CRAN but it has an official hexagon.Here it is:

Let me know if you like it in the Disqus form below in the post.

In order to price a swap you just need to run the following code.

```
library(SwapPricer)
SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer::swap.basket, lubridate::ymd(20190414), SwapPricer::df.table)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 7
## swap.id clean.mv dirty.mv accrual.pay accrual.receive par pv01
## 
## 1 Swap 25y -8.82e5 -8.75e5 5441. 1379. 0.00771 -12394.
## 2 Swap 30y 2.34e5 1.24e5 -97222. -12470 0.0111 20867.
## 3 Swap 10y 2.22e5 2.36e5 6702. 7361. -0.00138 -5724.
## 4 Swap 2y16y 3.60e5 3.60e5 0 0 0.0118 -11163.
## 5 Swap non … -2.59e6 -2.87e6 -263836. -14681. 0.0107 27914.
```

You can see that I have used two objects that are delivered with the package:


*swap.basket* which consists in a 5 swaps portfolio that can be referenced asblueprint for your swap portfolio


*df.table* this is the discount curve downloaded from Bloomberg as at the 14thof April 2019


We have tested the package using a 500 swaps portfolio and the results, in termsof performance are very encouraging. We analyse them using the amazing *profvis*tool.
