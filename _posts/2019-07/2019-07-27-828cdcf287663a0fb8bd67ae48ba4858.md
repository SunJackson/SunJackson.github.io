**Next Generation Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems**

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of distributed engineered environments where the monitoring and surveillance tasks are governed by tightly integrated computing, communication and control technologies. CPS are omnipresent in our everyday life. Hacking and failures of such systems have impact on critical services with potentially significant and lasting consequences. In this paper, we review which requirements a CPS must meet to address the challenges of tomorrow. Two key challenges are understanding and reinforcing the resilience of CPS.

**Techniques for Automated Machine Learning**

Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to find optimal machine learning solutions automatically given a machine learning problem. It could release the burden of data scientists from the multifarious manual tuning process and enable the access of domain experts to the off-the-shelf machine learning solutions without extensive experience. In this paper, we review the current developments of AutoML in terms of three categories, automated feature engineering (AutoFE), automated model and hyperparameter learning (AutoMHL), and automated deep learning (AutoDL). State-of-the-art techniques adopted in the three categories are presented, including Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, and gradient-based approaches. We summarize popular AutoML frameworks and conclude with current open challenges of AutoML.

**Tutorial: Deriving the Standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Loss Function**

In Bayesian machine learning, the posterior distribution is typically computationally intractable, hence variational inference is often required. In this approach, an evidence lower bound on the log likelihood of data is maximized during training. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are one important example where variational inference is utilized. In this tutorial, we derive the variational lower bound loss function of the standard variational autoencoder. We do so in the instance of a gaussian latent prior and gaussian approximate posterior, under which assumptions the Kullback-Leibler term in the variational lower bound has a closed form solution. We derive essentially everything we use along the way; everything from Bayes’ theorem to the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

**Conscientious Classification: A Data Scientist’s Guide to Discrimination-Aware Classification**

Recent research has helped to cultivate growing awareness that machine learning systems fueled by big data can create or exacerbate troubling disparities in society. Much of this research comes from outside of the practicing data science community, leaving its members with little concrete guidance to proactively address these concerns. This article introduces issues of discrimination to the data science community on its own terms. In it, we tour the familiar data mining process while providing a taxonomy of common practices that have the potential to produce unintended discrimination. We also survey how discrimination is commonly measured, and suggest how familiar development processes can be augmented to mitigate systems’ discriminatory potential. We advocate that data scientists should be intentional about modeling and reducing discriminatory outcomes. Without doing so, their efforts will result in perpetuating any systemic discrimination that may exist, but under a misleading veil of data-driven objectivity.

**Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Internet of Things: Model, Applications and Challenges**

The Internet of Things (IoT) extends the Internet connectivity into billions of IoT devices around the world, which collect and share information to reflect the status of physical world. The Autonomous Control System (ACS), on the other hand, performs control functions on the physical systems without external intervention over an extended period of time. The integration of IoT and ACS results in a new concept – autonomous IoT (AIoT). The sensors collect information on the system status, based on which intelligent agents in IoT devices as well as Edge/Fog/Cloud servers make control decisions for the actuators to react. In order to achieve autonomy, a promising method is for the intelligent agents to leverage the techniques in the field of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision making. In this paper, we first provide comprehensive survey of the state-of-art research, and then propose a general model for the applications of RL/DRL in AIoT. Finally, the challenges and open issues for future research are identified.

**Fast Convolutional Dictionary Learning off the Grid**

Given a continuous-time signal that can be modeled as the superposition of localized, time-shifted events from multiple sources, the goal of Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) is to identify the location of the events–by Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC)–and learn the template for each source–by Convolutional Dictionary Update (CDU). In practice, because we observe samples of the continuous-time signal on a uniformly-sampled grid in discrete time, classical CSC methods can only produce estimates of the times when the events occur on this grid, which degrades the performance of the CDU. We introduce a CDL framework that significantly reduces the errors arising from performing the estimation in discrete time. Specifically, we construct an expanded dictionary that comprises, not only discrete-time shifts of the templates, but also interpolated variants, obtained by bandlimited interpolation, that account for continuous-time shifts. For CSC, we develop a novel computationally efficient CSC algorithm, termed Convolutional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with interpolated dictionary (COMP-INTERP). We benchmarked COMP-INTERP to Contiunuous Basis Pursuit (CBP), the state-of-the-art CSC algorithm for estimating off-the-grid events, and demonstrate, on simulated data, that 1) COMP-INTERP achieves a similar level of accuracy, and 2) is two orders of magnitude faster. For CDU, we derive a novel procedure to update the templates given sparse codes that can occur both on and off the discrete-time grid. We also show that 3) dictionary update with the overcomplete dictionary yields more accurate templates. Finally, we apply the algorithms to the spike sorting problem on electrophysiology recording and show their competitive performance.

**On the Consistency among Prior, Posteriors, and Information Sets (Extended Abstract)**

This paper studies implications of the consistency conditions among prior, posteriors, and information sets on introspective properties of qualitative belief induced from information sets. The main result reformulates the consistency conditions as: (i) the information sets, without any assumption, almost surely form a partition; and (ii) the posterior at a state is equal to the Bayes conditional probability given the corresponding information set. Implications are as follows. First, each posterior is uniquely determined. Second, qualitative belief reduces to fully introspective knowledge in a “standard” environment. Thus, a care must be taken when one studies non-veridical belief or non-introspective knowledge. Third, an information partition compatible with the consistency conditions is uniquely determined by the posteriors. Fourth, qualitative and probability-one beliefs satisfy truth axiom almost surely. The paper also sheds light on how the additivity of the posteriors yields negative introspective properties of beliefs.

**Efficient Novelty-Driven Neural Architecture Search**

One-Shot Neural architecture search (NAS) attracts broad attention recently due to its capacity to reduce the computational hours through weight sharing. However, extensive experiments on several recent works show that there is no positive correlation between the validation accuracy with inherited weights from the supernet and the test accuracy after re-training for One-Shot NAS. Different from devising a controller to find the best performing architecture with inherited weights, this paper focuses on how to sample architectures to train the supernet to make it more predictive. A single-path supernet is adopted, where only a small part of weights are optimized in each step, to reduce the memory demand greatly. Furthermore, we abandon devising complicated reward based architecture sampling controller, and sample architectures to train supernet based on novelty search. An efficient novelty search method for NAS is devised in this paper, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our novelty search based architecture sampling method. The best architecture obtained by our algorithm with the same search space achieves the state-of-the-art test error rate of 2.51\% on CIFAR-10 with only 7.5 hours search time in a single GPU, and a validation perplexity of 60.02 and a test perplexity of 57.36 on PTB. We also transfer these search cell structures to larger datasets ImageNet and WikiText-2, respectively.

**Feature-Model-Guided Online Learning for Self-Adaptive Systems**

A self-adaptive system can modify its own structure and behavior at runtime based on its perception of the environment, of itself and of its requirements. To develop a self-adaptive system, software developers codify knowledge about the system and its environment, as well as how adaptation actions impact on the system. However, the codified knowledge may be insufficient due to design time uncertainty, and thus a self-adaptive system may execute adaptation actions that do not have the desired effect. Online learning is an emerging approach to address design time uncertainty by employing machine learning at runtime. Online learning accumulates knowledge at runtime by, for instance, exploring not-yet executed adaptation actions. We address two specific problems with respect to online learning for self-adaptive systems. First, the number of possible adaptation actions can be very large. Existing online learning techniques randomly explore the possible adaptation actions, but this can lead to slow convergence of the learning process. Second, the possible adaptation actions can change as a result of system evolution. Existing online learning techniques are unaware of these changes and thus do not explore new adaptation actions, but explore adaptation actions that are no longer valid. We propose using feature models to give structure to the set of adaptation actions and thereby guide the exploration process during online learning. Experimental results involving four real-world systems suggest that considering the hierarchical structure of feature models may speed up convergence by 7.2% on average. Considering the differences between feature models before and after an evolution step may speed up convergence by 64.6% on average. […]

**FedHealth: A Federated Transfer Learning Framework for Wearable Healthcare**

With the rapid development of computing technology, wearable devices such as smart phones and wristbands make it easy to get access to people’s health information including activities, sleep, sports, etc. Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user data. However, there are two critical challenges. Firstly, user data often exists in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Secondly, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this paper, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds personalized models by transfer learning. It is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. Experiments demonstrate that FedHealth produces higher accuracy (5.3% improvement) for wearable activity recognition when compared to traditional methods. FedHealth is general and extensible and has the potential to be used in many healthcare applications.

**Introducing Hypergraph Signal Processing: Theoretical Foundation and Practical Applications**

Signal processing over graphs has recently attracted significant attentions for dealing with structured data. Normal graphs, however, only model pairwise relationships between nodes and are not effective in representing and capturing some high-order relationships of data samples. In this work, we propose a new framework of hypergraph signal processing (HGSP) based on tensor representation to generalize the traditional graph signal processing (GSP) to tackle high-order interactions. We introduce the core concepts of HGSP and define the hypergraph Fourier space. We analyze the spectrum properties of hypergraph Fourier transform and explain its connection to mainstream digital signal processing. We derive the novel hypergraph sampling theory and present the fundamentals of hypergraph filter design based on the tensor framework. We present HGSP-based methods for several signal processing and data analysis applications. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement using our HGSP framework over some traditional signal processing solutions.

**Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting: The Electric Load Case**

Management and efficient operations in critical infrastructure such as Smart Grids take huge advantage of accurate power load forecasting which, due to its nonlinear nature, remains a challenging task. Recently, deep learning has emerged in the machine learning field achieving impressive performance in a vast range of tasks, from image classification to machine translation. Applications of deep learning models to the electric load forecasting problem are gaining interest among researchers as well as the industry, but a comprehensive and sound comparison among different architectures is not yet available in the literature. This work aims at filling the gap by reviewing and experimentally evaluating on two real-world datasets the most recent trends in electric load forecasting, by contrasting deep learning architectures on short term forecast (one day ahead prediction). Specifically, we focus on feedforward and recurrent neural networks, sequence to sequence models and temporal convolutional neural networks along with architectural variants, which are known in the signal processing community but are novel to the load forecasting one.

**A-Phase classification using convolutional neural networks**

A series of short events, called A-phases, can be observed in the human electroencephalogram during NREM sleep. These events can be classified in three groups (A1, A2 and A3) according to their spectral contents, and are thought to play a role in the transitions between the different sleep stages. A-phase detection and classification is usually performed manually by a trained expert, but it is a tedious and time-consuming task. In the past two decades, various researchers have designed algorithms to automatically detect and classify the A-phases with varying degrees of success, but the problem remains open. In this paper, a different approach is proposed: instead of attempting to design a general classifier for all subjects, we propose to train ad-hoc classifiers for each subject using as little data as possible, in order to drastically reduce the amount of time required from the expert. The proposed classifiers are based on deep convolutional neural networks using the log-spectrogram of the EEG signal as input data. Results are encouraging, achieving average accuracies of 80.31% when discriminating between A-phases and non A-phases, and 71.87% when classifying among A-phase sub-types, with only 25% of the total A-phases used for training. When additional expert-validated data is considered, the sub-type classification accuracy increases to 78.92%. These results show that a semi-automatic annotation system with assistance from an expert could provide a better alternative to fully automatic classifiers.

**Syntax-aware Neural Semantic Role Labeling**

Semantic role labeling (SRL), also known as shallow semantic parsing, is an important yet challenging task in NLP. Motivated by the close correlation between syntactic and semantic structures, traditional discrete-feature-based SRL approaches make heavy use of syntactic features. In contrast, deep-neural-network-based approaches usually encode the input sentence as a word sequence without considering the syntactic structures. In this work, we investigate several previous approaches for encoding syntactic trees, and make a thorough study on whether extra syntax-aware representations are beneficial for neural SRL models. Experiments on the benchmark CoNLL-2005 dataset show that syntax-aware SRL approaches can effectively improve performance over a strong baseline with external word representations from ELMo. With the extra syntax-aware representations, our approaches achieve new state-of-the-art 85.6 F1 (single model) and 86.6 F1 (ensemble) on the test data, outperforming the corresponding strong baselines with ELMo by 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. Detailed error analysis are conducted to gain more insights on the investigated approaches.

**Application of Data Stream Processing Technologies in Industry 4.0 — What is Missing?**

Industry 4.0 is becoming more and more important for manufacturers as the developments in the area of Internet of Things advance. Another technology gaining more attention is data stream processing systems. Although such streaming frameworks seem to be a natural fit for Industry 4.0 scenarios, their application in this context is still low. The contributions in this paper are threefold. Firstly, we present industry findings that we derived from site inspections with a focus on Industry 4.0. Moreover, our view on Industry 4.0 and important related aspects is elaborated. As a third contribution, we illustrate our opinion on why data stream processing technologies could act as an enabler for Industry 4.0 and point out possible obstacles on this way.

**Towards an LSTM-based Predictive Framework for Literature-based Knowledge Discovery**

Literature-based knowledge discovery process identifies the important but implicit relations among information embedded in published literature. Existing techniques from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing attempt to identify the hidden or unpublished connections between information concepts within published literature, however, these techniques undermine the concept of predicting the future and emerging relations among scientific knowledge components encapsulated within the literature. Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN), built upon author selected keywords (i.e., knowledge entities), is considered as a knowledge graph that focuses both on these knowledge components and knowledge structure of a scientific domain by examining the relationships between knowledge entities. Using data from two multidisciplinary research domains other than the medical domain, capitalizing on bibliometrics, the dynamicity of temporal KCNs, and a Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network, this study proposed a framework to successfully predict the future literature-based discoveries – the emerging connections among knowledge units. Framing the problem as a dynamic supervised link prediction task, the proposed framework integrates some novel node and edge-level features. Temporal importance of keywords computed from both bipartite and unipartite networks, communities of keywords, built upon genealogical relations, and relative importance of temporal citation counts used in the feature construction process. Both node and edge-level features were input into an LSTM network to forecast the feature values for positive and negatively labeled non-connected keyword pairs and classify them accurately. High classification performance rates suggest that these features are supportive both in predicting the emerging connections between scientific knowledge units and emerging trend analysis.
