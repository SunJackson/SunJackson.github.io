As data scientists, we are often presented with a dataset and are asked to use it to produce insights. We use R to wrangle, visualize, model, and produce tables and plots for sharing or publication. When we focus on the data in hand in this way, we don’t get to consider where the data came from. The sample size and the set of variables and their scales are fixed. Yet the procedures used to gather or generate them are hugely consequential for how we should analyze the data and also the quality of the insights we can ultimately deliver. Sampling procedures have implications for how the resulting data should be analyzed. For studies that seek to measure causal effects, it matters how some units come to be treated and others left untreated.

Because these processes are so important, we wanted to make a tool that would help data scientists and other researchers **imagine** their data **before** they collect it so that any changes to process can be made before it’s too late.

When the data is already collected, the tool allows you to imagine your data before you **analyze** it. When we make data wrangling and modeling decisions based on the results we find under each procedure, or using model fit statistics, we are vulnerable to the unconscious biases labeled the garden of forking paths or p-hacking that may lead us to select the analysis procedure that produces the best answer. We use the actual data because we don’t have a good substitute: data with the same structure and variables that we have collected.

This post introduces the `fabricatr` package, whose role in the `DeclareDesign` suite of packages is to simulate data structure and variables. See this RViews post introducing `DeclareDesign` and the philosophy behind it. `fabricatr` helps you to think about your data before you start analysis or even collection. What are the units? How are they structured? What measurements will you take? What are their ranges and how are they correlated? `fabricatr` can help you simulate mock data before you collect the real data, and test out different estimation strategies without worrying about biasing your inferences.

Most simply, `fabricatr` will create a single-level data structure given a number of units.

```
library(fabricatr)
fabricate(N = 100, temp_fahrenheit = rnorm(N, mean = 80, sd = 20))
```

```

Social science data is often **hierarchical**. For example, schools have classrooms that have students. `fabricatr` shines here with the `add_level` command. By default, new levels are nested within the levels above them.

```
library(fabricatr)
fabricate(
 # five schools
 school = add_level(N = 5,
 n_classrooms = sample(10:15, N, replace = TRUE)),
 # 10 to 15 classrooms per school
 classroom = add_level(N = n_classrooms),
 # 15 students per classroom
 student = add_level(N = 15)
 )
```

```

The real world often produces messy, overlapping hierarchies. For example, student data may be collected from middle school and also high school, in which case students are nested in two different schools, but those schools are not nested within each other. Here’s how to make such “cross-classified” data. The `rho` parameter governs how correlated `primary_rank` and `secondary_rank` should be.

```
dat <- 
fabricate(
 primary_schools = add_level(N = 5, primary_rank = 1:N),
 secondary_schools = add_level(N = 6, secondary_rank = 1:N, nest = FALSE),
 students = link_levels(N = 15, by = join(primary_rank, secondary_rank, rho = 0.9))
)
```

```
## `link_levels()` calls are faster if the `mvnfast` package is installed.
```

```
ggplot(dat, aes(primary_rank, secondary_rank)) + geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1), alpha = 0.5) + theme_bw()
```

Similarly, you can create longitudinal data via `cross_levels`:

```
fabricate(
 students = add_level(N = 2),
 years = add_level(N = 20, year = 1981:2000, nest = FALSE),
 student_year = cross_levels(by = join(students, years))
)
```

|2|01|1981|02|
|1|02|1982|03|
|2|02|1982|04|
|1|03|1983|05|
|2|03|1983|06|

R has lots of great tools for simulating variables. In some cases, though, common kinds of outcome variables are surprisingly tough to simulate. `fabricatr` collects a small number of functions to create variable types commonly used by social scientists, with simple syntax. We describe two examples here, but see ourvariable creation vignette for the rest.

## Variables with intra-class correlation

With the data structure tools described above, you can construct data that haswithin-unit and between-unit variation, for example, variation within classroomsand variation across classrooms in test scores. However, many times you want toset the level of intra-class correlation (ICC) more precisely. We help with`draw_normal_icc` and `draw_binary_icc`.

```
dat <- 
 fabricate(
 N = 1000,
 clusters = sample(LETTERS, N, replace = TRUE),
 Y1 = draw_normal_icc(clusters = clusters, ICC = .2),
 Y2 = draw_binary_icc(clusters = clusters, ICC = .2)
 )
ICC::ICCbare(clusters, Y1, dat)
```

```
## [1] 0.09726701
```

```
ICC::ICCbare(clusters, Y2, dat)
```

```
## [1] 0.176036
```

## Ordered outcomes

We provide a set of tools for discrete random variables (including ordered outcomes). We take a latent variable (i.e., `test_ability`) and transform it into an ordered variable (`test_score`).

```
dat <- 
fabricate(
 N = 100,
 test_ability = rnorm(N),
 test_score = draw_ordered(test_ability, breaks = c(-.5, 0, .5))
)
ggplot(dat, aes(test_ability, test_score)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

`fabricatr` is compatible with almost any R variable creation function. We highlight other terrific R packages that help simulate social science-relevant variables in a vignette here.

This post is a high-level teaser for `fabricatr`’s functionality, but for a deeper introduction, check out the fabricatr getting started vignette. You can also download and print this cheatsheet.

You can install `fabricatr` from CRAN:

```
install.packages("fabricatr")
library(fabricatr)
```
