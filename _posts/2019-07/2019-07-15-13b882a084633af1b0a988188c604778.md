For some time I’ve wanted to recreate the cover art from Joy Division’s *Unknown Pleasures* album. The visualisation depicts successive pulses from the pulsar PSR B1919+21, discovered by Jocelyn Bell in 1967.

## Data

The first obstacle was acquiring the data. I found a D3 visualisation by Mike Bostock. This in turn pointed me to a CSV file in a gist belonging to @borgar.

After reading the CSV data into `pulsar` I applied some light wrangling (the raw data is a matrix).

```
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

pulsar <- read.csv(CSV_URL, header = FALSE) %>%
 mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
 gather(col, height, -row) %>%
 mutate(
 col = sub("^V", "", col) %>% as.integer()
 )
```

## Plot

Thanks to the ggridges package, making the plot was simple.

```
ggplot(pulsar, aes(x = col, y = row, height = height, group = row)) +
 geom_ridgeline(min_height = min(pulsar$height),
 scale= 0.2,
 size = 1,
 fill = "black",
 colour = "white") +
 scale_y_reverse() +
 theme_void() +
 theme(
 panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
 plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black", color = "black"),
 )
```

A few things worth noting:

1. To get the sense of the rows right I had to reverse the direction of the y-axis (this was also important to ensure that the animation reveals from top to bottom).

1. It’s necessary to set both the `color` and `fill` for `plot.background` otherwise you get an irritating white outline.

## Animation

Using `transition_states()` from the gganimate package I turned the static plot into an animation. I applied `shadow_mark()` with a value of `alpha` just below 1 to allow a small amount of transparency between each of the layers as the animation accumulates. This effect is not present in the original graphic, but I think that it’s informative to be able to see what’s happening “behind” each of the layers.
