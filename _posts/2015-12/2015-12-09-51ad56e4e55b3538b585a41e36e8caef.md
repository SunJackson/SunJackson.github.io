ICCV 2015: Twenty one hottest research papers




"Geometry vs Recognition" becomes ConvNet-for-X
Computer Vision used to be cleanly separated into two schools: **geometry** and **recognition**. Geometric methods like structure from motion and optical flow usually focus on measuring objective real-world quantities like 3D "real-world" distances directly from images and recognition techniques like support vector machines and probabilistic graphical models traditionally focus on perceiving high-level semantic information (i.e., is this a dog or a table) directly from images.


The world of computer vision is changing fast has changed. We now have powerful convolutional neural networks that are able to extract *just about anything* directly from images. So if your input is an image (or set of images), then there's probably a ConvNet for your problem.  While you do need a large labeled dataset, believe me when I say that collecting a large dataset is much easier than manually tweaking knobs inside your 100K-line codebase. As we're about to see, the separation between geometric methods and learning-based methods is no longer easily discernible.

By 2016 just about everybody in the computer vision community will have tasted the power of ConvNets, so let's take a look at some of the hottest new research directions in computer vision.


ICCV 2015's Twenty One Hottest Research Papers




To no surprise, this year's ICCV is filled with lots of ConvNets, but this time the applications of these Deep Learning tools are being applied to much much more creative tasks. Let's take a look at the following **twenty one ICCV 2015 research papers**, which will hopefully give you a taste of where the field is going.

1. Ask Your Neurons: A Neural-Based Approach to Answering Questions About Images Mateusz Malinowski, Marcus Rohrbach, Mario Fritz

Conclusion
While some can argue that the great convergence upon ConvNets is making the field less diverse, it is actually making the techniques easier to comprehend. It is easier to "borrow breakthrough thinking" from one research direction when the core computations are cast in the language of ConvNets. Using ConvNets, properly trained (and motivated!) 21 year old graduate student are actually able to compete on benchmarks, where previously it would take an entire 6-year PhD cycle to compete on a non-trivial benchmark.

See you next week in Chile!
