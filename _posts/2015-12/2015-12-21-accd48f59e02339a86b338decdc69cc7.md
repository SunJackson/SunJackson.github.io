The Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast is now available via Stitcher! Subscribe in the app, or listen online:If you have another podcast app, you can subscribe by entering the RSS feed link: https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/feed/podcast

There is also a built-in audio player here on the blog that I link to in each episode: https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/podcast/

I’m working on getting a logo now, so hopefully it won’t have a placeholder image for long :) I want to submit it to iTunes, but I have to download the dreaded iTunes desktop software in order to submit and manage it… ugh ridiculous.

Anyway, enjoy it on the blog and on Stitcher for now!
