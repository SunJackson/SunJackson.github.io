More notes for myselfâ€¦ so it may not be helpful for you who bumped into here. ðŸ˜‰

Setting Theano correctly **is not enough** to ensure you can run deep learning software correctly. In our case, it will be Keras, and it can slow to a crawl if not setup properly.

Again, there could be many causes but I try to outline a clean step what I did, the performance I run a good setup, so you can compare. Hopefully you can glean some places where you did wrong.

My server has the following specifications finished running the steps outlined here.

- OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, X64

- GPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 780

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

- CUDA 7.5

- Theano 0.7.0

- Numpy 1.8.2

- Kera 0.2.0

- Scipy 0.13.3

- NVIDIA-SMI 352.39

- Graphics Driver Version: 352.39


1. Make sure your Theano configuration file, located at ~/.theanorc, is correct:


```
# Run this python code
from theano.sandbox.cuda.dnn import *
print(dnn_available())
print(dnn_available.msg)

```

1. Install CuDNN if you are using ConvNet. The basic implementations of convolution in Theano are significantly slower.


I also captured the environment variables, replace echio with your username:

Googling the error message doesnâ€™t help too much.

You need to add the location of the 3. into CPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH. This is what my .bashrc looks like this (replace echio with your username):

If you instead see this error message:

You probably didnâ€™t have CUDA environment variables setup properly. See the above ~/.bashrc lines for correct setup.


Run this code again.
# Run this python code
 from theano.sandbox.cuda.dnn import *
 print(dnn_available())
 print(dnn_available.msg)


You should see below when executed in a Python REPL.

This is good! Re-run your Keras code and hopefully it will be fast this timeâ€¦

This may or may not solve your problem, but it certainly solved some of my problems. You will probably have to learn to debug things a bit to figure out how to get it to run well.
