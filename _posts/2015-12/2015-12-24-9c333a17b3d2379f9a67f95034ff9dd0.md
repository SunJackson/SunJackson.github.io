Machine learning is about writing programs with parameters that are learned from
data. But writing the base
architecture that will be learned requires intuition, inspection, trial, and
error, all elements that can be enhanced with high quality visualization
and analytics tools.



Building visualization and analytics tools to assist deep learning (and machine
learning in general) development was what motivated my brother Tiago
Santana and I to start
Agnez, a
collection of visualization tools for deep learning.
Models used for deep learning can be seen a business where the architecture and
hyperparameters are the business choices and the accuracy or error in the test
set a measure of business success. Keeping that metaphor in mind we looked for
companies such as Keen IO and projects such as the 
Automatic Statistician for
inspiration to build research analytics and visualization tools. 

Here we will describe our approach to serve the visualizations as a web app
using Feathers.js in the backend and Keen Dashboards
in the frontend. For generating the graphs we are using a temporary solution
based on mpld3 that converts Matplotlib graphs to D3. The
full code is on minimal-app repository.
A schematic diagram of our architecture is shown in the figure below.

We wanted to generate beautifully organized dashboards and we noticed that Keen Dashboards
already lifted most of the design weight. But as an originally Python developer,
I suggested to keep
Matplotlib’s subplot arrangement and 
flexibility without needing to rewrite html ourselves. An elegant solution to this
problem would be to generate the dashboards dynamically using a REST API. We chose to develop
the API with Feathers.js,
a thin wrapper around Express.js for building real time REST
APIs with Node.js. This is what we needed to start a simple to use and general API for
handling, storing and plotting model analytics.
In coffeescript and using NeDB as the database, our
Feathers app is simply:

```
feathers = require 'feathers'
mongodb = require('feathers-mongodb')
memory = mongodb {
 db: 'edermempy'
 collection: 'values'
}

bodyParser = require 'body-parser'
app = feathers()

app.configure feathers.rest()
 .configure feathers.socketio()
 .use bodyParser.json()
 .use '/values', memory
 .use '/', feathers.static(__dirname)
 .listen 3000

console.log 'App listening on port 3000
console.log 'Index at', __dirname+'/static/'

```

All the hard work is handled by feathers-nedb CRUD and feathers-client that
uses socket.io to update the browser client in real time. The machine
learning client training our model with Python sends POST
requests to the server. These requests trigger events in the server that
updates the browser page. For this simple demo, our Python client will send html
strings generated with mpld3 and a gif. When training a deep learning model the
html string would be graphs of cost functions, accuracy, weight norms and other
useful analytics. As we mentioned this is a simple temporary solution for
illustration purposes, it would be more general to use a native D3 chart,
patch the graphs in the browser side and only send numbers from the machine
learning side. Nevertheless, deep learning epochs, or passes through the
training datasets, usually
take a few seconds (or even minutes and hours depending on how large the training dataset is)
and sending html strings does not add a considerable overhead.

The index.html is pretty minimal since everything will be generated dynamically
when we send data using the API. We start with a simple ``
and add new Bootstrap rows later. `script.coffee` in the server has a basic
Keen Dashboard cell as follows:

```
String.prototype.format = ->
 args = arguments
 return this.replace /{(\d+)}/g, (match, number) ->
 return if typeof args[number] isnt 'undefined' then args[number] else match

cellstr = """
 
 {0} 
 
 {2} 
 
 {3} 
 
 
"""

```

With this code we can fill the placeholders using a Python inspired syntax:
`"dat {0} is {1}".format "string", "cool"` which returns `"dat string is cool"`.
When creating a new cell, we simply append the filled string to `#dashboard`‘s html.
When the html string or an image URL is patched,
we update that dashboard cell using the snippet below:

```
values.on 'patched', (val) ->
 console.log 'patching', val.name
 $grid = $ "#grid#{val.pos}"
 $title = $ "#title#{val.pos}"
 $description = $ "#description#{val.pos}"

 $title.html val.name
 $description.html val.description
 if val.type is "html"
 $grid.html val.value
 if val.type is "img"
 $grid.html "<img src="#{val.value}'>"

```

To test the app, we use the Python script ahead.

```



url = "./images/main_img.gif"
r = requests.post("http://localhost:3000/values",
 json={'name': '', 'type': 'html', 'value': [], 'pos': 0,
 'description': ''})
id0 = json.loads(r.text)["_id"]
r = requests.post("http://localhost:3000/values",
 json={'name': '', 'type': 'img', 'value': [], 'pos': 1,
 'description': ''})
id1 = json.loads(r.text)["_id"]
fig = plt.figure()
numbers = []


for i in range(100):
 time.sleep(2) 
 plt.clf()
 numbers.append(random.random()) 
 plt.plot(numbers)
 if len(numbers) > 20:
 del numbers[0] 
 html = mpld3.fig_to_html(fig) 
 
 r = requests.patch("http://localhost:3000/values/" + str(id0),
 json={'name': 'test1', 'type': 'html', 'value': html,
 'pos': 0, 'description': 'simple test'})
 r = requests.patch("http://localhost:3000/values/" + str(id1),
 json={'name': 'test2', 'type': 'img', 'value': url,
 'pos': 1, 'description': 'simple image'})
 print r

```

Note that since REST APIs are universal, we could send pictures and graphs with any
other language. In the next iteration of this app, using native D3 charts
generated in the browser side we
will make even easier to serve visualizations in a way that is language agnostic to the
machine learning side (Lua and C++ are also popular for deep learning). 

For those interested in playing with this code, from the source root directory run

```
coffee app.coffee

```

to start up the app and run

```
python test.py

```

to send data using the API. We can see the results at http://localhost:3000
and https://localhost:3000/values

If you are training a deep learning model with Keras you can run the app and
use the Keras callbacks we provide, as in this
example.

Since Agnez is an young project, we are expecting it evolve quickly. Help,
suggestions and feedback are welcome.
