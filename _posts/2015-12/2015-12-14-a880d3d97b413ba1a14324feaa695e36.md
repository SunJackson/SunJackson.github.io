AI stands for artificial intelligence, but it currently has a lot in
common with chemistry in the ages when it was named Alchemy.

Alex net recipe: 

1. 5 five convolutional layers 

1. 2 fully-connected layers 

1. Softmax layer with 1000 outputs on top 

1. Use Imagenet dataset for training 

Train it carefully with SGD for 2 weeks if you don’t have proper equipment, or
for 16 hours if you do. 

In high school we learn that knowledge evolves from myths. The demystification
is carried by careful investigation, experimentation, reproducibility and
analysis, all guided by the scientific method. 

The scientific method is a fantastic tool, but I have always been equally
fascinated by what was accomplished with other knowledge tools such as
art and mythical approaches. My main question was “What did the human mind feel like
in pre-scientific method ages?”. For PhD candidate in deep learning, it was 
humbling to observe that we somewhat live
in such an age with respect to artificial intelligence.

Deep learning is one of the computational approaches to unlocking
the mysteries of intelligence. The understanding intelligence today, resembles
the understanding chemistry in the times of the alchemists. Those chemical
experimentalists of the old ages developed practical recipes for manipulating
the dowries of Nature, all without the guide of today’s chemistry and physics.
Similarly, we can achieve arguably intelligent-like behavior with deep learning. 
There is no broadly accepted definition in chemistry, physics, mathematics,
nor in philosophy or poetry about what is Intelligence. Yet over and over
again we have been able to write programs to tackle tasks that years ago would require a
human to solve. These solutions are developed with intuition and arduous repetition,
just like the alchemist’s workings.

I’ve noticed a few other parallels between the fields of artificial and alchemical
intelligence that I list next.

### Philosopher’s stone

```
Our mission SOLVE INTELLIGENCE - Google DeepMind

```

Alchemists’ ultimate goal was to turn any base metal into gold and
find the Elixir of Life. Artificial Intelligence seeks general purpose
intelligence, universal program solvers, and building machines with human-like
intelligence. These ambitious goals are
successfully motivating investigators and patrons alike. 

On the other hand, although those involved in the research know how far they are from their
Philosopher’s Stone, possible consequences of their declared ultimate goals can
be fearsome for outsiders.

### Fear

```
Our greatest existential threat - Elon Musk on AI

```

Control over gold and life would be nothing but disruptive. It would break
economies, health, politics, religion, and any other power systems. Equally
world changing would be a
machine with human intelligence and without human weaknesses, built as a
single owner homunculus. Couldn’t that owner use his homunculus as the ultimate
worker and accumulate unequal wealth or use it as the perfect soldier to conquer less
technologically gifted societies?

The unknown is scary and not everybody understands how AI or Alchemy works
especially when practitioners are so fond of their mystic terminologies.

### Mysticism

```
This state has a 2-dimensional structure: it consists of
w × h vectors of m numbers, i.e., it is a 3-dimensional
tensor of shape [w, h, m]. This "mental image" evolves
in time in a way defined by a convolutional gated
recurrent unit. - Łukasz Kaiser and Ilya Sutskever
on Neural GPUs Learn Algorithms.
(Quotation marks are ours)

```

Arthur C. Clarke noticed that, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic”. This resonates deeply with our minds so much that
we sometimes avoid attributing mundane descriptions to what we recently
discovered possible with our
magic. For example, alchemists used to name their elements after Roman gods
to represent their powers. Deep learners like to attribute cognitive
properties to their algorithms such as attention and dreaming, even if they are
just calculating first order moments or sampling from a parametric probability
distribution. Esoteric terminology has also been widely accepted in names such
as Hidden Layers, Dark Knowledge, Skip-Thought Vectors and algorithms that 
Learn to Think.

After all, we have always calculated first order moments, but only now we
use it to filter context relevant values. Also,
random number generators have never consistently generated realistic or scary images. 

It takes a few generations for a technology to feel common enough for
practitioners to retract their mystic terminologies.

### Enlightenment

```
"in recognition of the extraordinary services he has
rendered by the discovery of the laws of chemical
dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions" - First
Nobel of Chemistry, awarded to Jacobus H. van't Hoff 

```

No one can deny the importance of chemistry to our daily life. Although
we can’t easily transform metals into gold, we know the Quantum laws that would
explain how that might work. On average we now live about twice as long 
as those seeking the Elixir of Life. For that, we should thank
understandings of the human body and medicines and all that started by claiming
god’s workings in alchemists labs. 

One day, AI might lose its mystic veil and we will no longer say that Neural
Networks can dream or pay attention. But when that time comes we will also be
practicing much more than smoke, self-driving cars, image recognition and mirrors.

Obviously, we will also rationally regulate AI the same way we regulate chemical
weapons, by focusing on the people, companies and governments that might exploit
it with bad will, and by teaching the technology alongside ethics classes.

### Predicting the future

I feel happy with better understanding of how the mind of our predecessors might
have worked. Looking back also helps me to understand the nature of the fear
and wonder surrounding today’s advanced technologies. But these same 
technologies don’t evolve
in unexplainable jumps. By the time we were able to fly, blow up a mountain,
transform metal or extend our life spans we no longer felt it was appropriate to
call it magic or threatening to human existence.

Right now we are still waiting for an AI theory that may enlighten the field in
the same way that Quantum Theory unveiled the real magic of Chemistry. A theory
that will not only explain what we did but also make even more possible.
At that point robots will be able to talk, draw, dance, work, navigate
using information in the spectrum of visible light and hearing sound, and behave
indistinguishably from humans. When AI becomes less alchemical,
I doubt that the majority of us will be scared, expecting the
protection of an AI Inquisition or worrying about what a machine is thinking.
