To end 2015, I decided to finally learn C, instead of making it a 2016 resolution! I had previously done the [â€˜Learn C The Hard Wayâ€™](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book) tutorials, taken about a year off, and thus forgotten everything.

Rather than re-do the same material, I decided to get [â€™21st Century Câ€™](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033677.do) from Oâ€™Reilly and work through that. Unfortunately, there is an error/misprint in the very beginning chapters that makes doing the exercises near impossible on OSX. This error manifests itself as `c99: invalid argument 'all' to -W Error 64`. If you encounter this error on OSX (Iâ€™m using OSX 10.11.2 El Capitan as of writing this post), here are three methods for fixing the issue.

## Error 64!

When the discussion of using [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) begins on page 15, there is a discussion of the â€œsmallest practicable makefileâ€�, which is just six lines long:

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
|P=program_name
OBJECTS=
CFLAGS= -g -Wall -O3
LDLIBS=
CC=c99

$(P): $(OBJECTS)

```

Unfortunately, this doesnâ€™t *quite* work on OSX. Page 11 in the book sort-of references that a fix is needed, but the directions arenâ€™t so clearâ€¦

## Error 64, solution 1: Book Fix, updated

To use the book fix, you are supposed to:

1. Create a file named *c99*

1. Put the lines `gcc -std=c99 $\*` OR `clang $\*` in the *c99* file

1. Add the file to your PATH in Terminal (such as `export PATH="/Users/computeruser:$PATH"` if the `c99` file were located in `/Users/computeruser` directory)

1. Run `chmod +x c99` on the file to make it executable


Once you add this work-around to your PATH, then open a fresh Terminal window (or run `source .bash_profile` to refresh the Bash settings), you should be able to use Make to compile your C code.

But to be honest, this seems like a really weird â€œfixâ€� to me, as it overrides the C compiler settings for any program run via Terminal. I prefer one of two alternate solutions.

## Error 64, solution 2: Makefile Change

As I was researching this, a helpful Twitter user noted:

When you switch the â€˜c99â€™ reference to just â€˜ccâ€™ in the Makefile, everything works fine. Hereâ€™s the subtlety different, corrected Makefile:

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
|P=program_name
OBJECTS=
CFLAGS= -g -Wall -O3
LDLIBS=
CC=cc

$(P): $(OBJECTS)

```

## Error 64, solution 3: Switch to Clang

The final solution I came across is rather than using the GCC compiler, you can use an alternate compiler called Clang, which is also generally available on OSX (especially with XCode installed). Like solution 2 above, the Makefile is just subtlety different:

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
|P=program_name
OBJECTS=
CFLAGS= -g -Wall -O3
LDLIBS=
CC=clang

$(P): $(OBJECTS)

```

Whether to use GCC or Clang as your compiler is really beyond the scope of this blog post; as *21st Century C* discusses, it really shouldnâ€™t matter (especially when you are just learning the mechanics of the language).

## Error 64, Be Gone!

Thereâ€™s not really much more to say at this point; this blog post is mainly documentation for anyone who comes across this error in the future. Iâ€™ve continued on through the book using Clang, but suffice to say, itâ€™s not the compiler that writes poor-quality, non-compiling code, itâ€™s the user. Ah, the fun of learning ğŸ™‚
