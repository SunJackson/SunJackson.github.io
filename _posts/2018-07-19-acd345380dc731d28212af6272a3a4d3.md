I spent a few days during the holidays fixing up a bunch of semi-dormant open source projects and I have a couple of blog posts in the pipeline about various updates. First up, I made a number of fixes to [Git of Theseus](https://github.com/erikbern/git-of-theseus) which is a tool (written in Python) that generates statistics about Git repositories. Iâ€™ve [written about it previously](https://erikbern.com/2016/12/05/the-half-life-of-code.html) on this blog. The name is a horrible pun (Iâ€™m a dad!) on [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) which is a philosophical thought experiment about what happens if you replace every single part of a boat â€” is it still the same boat â�‰ï¸� ğŸ¤”

So anyway, hereâ€™s one of the plots you can generate for [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) â€” a somewhat arbitrarily picked repository.

So whatâ€™s new? Iâ€™ve updated the color scheme a bit, but also added the option to plot author statistics:

And it doesnâ€™t stop there! Here are some other minor updates:

- I published the [whole thing to PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/git-of-theseus) which also means that the installation is far simpler: just run `pip install git-of-theseus`.

- The pip package also installs binaries that lets you run the analyses in a more straightforward way: just run `git-of-theseus-analyze` on the command line.

- By default it now only analyzes file types of certain extensions that indicate source code (by leveraging [pygments](http://pygments.org/))

- You can also normalize stats using the `--normalize` flag. See plot below:

Thatâ€™s it! As I mentioned I got more where this came from. Some future blog posts will cover:

- [ann-benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) which is a tool to benchmark approximate nearest neighbor methods. Very niche, but very useful within its niche. I just spent a lot of time precomputing datasets and Dockerizing all algorithms.

- [convoys](https://github.com/better/convoys) a new tool I built to model and plot time-lagged conversion. Fun stuff with Gamma and Weibull distributions.

- [champy](https://github.com/better/champy) which is a halfway implementation wrapper that lets you formulate and solve [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming), [mixed integer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming), and [constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) problems in a much nicer way (IMO) than any other library Iâ€™ve encountered. Donâ€™t hold your breath for this one â€” itâ€™s pretty far from being production-grade.


EDIT(2018-01-16): added a few more notes
