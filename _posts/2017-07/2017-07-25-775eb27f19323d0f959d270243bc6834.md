1. Sorry for the issues loading images and with logins on this site. I’ve had problems ever since I had bluehost set me up with HTTPS certificates, and apparently those certificates have expired or something and are causing issues with the images being able to load, etc. I’ll look into it, but I also have a busy week at work and wasn’t planning on site maintenance here this week, so it might be this way for a little bit. I am aware of it and a fix is on my to-do list, though! Thanks for your patience.

2. I published a post over on DataSciGuide about [resources for data science beginners](http://www.datasciguide.com/recommended-resources-for-beginners). Check it out!

Thanks for your continued readership here!

P.S. I’m working on the podcast again, so the 2 already-recorded episodes are back in the work pipeline :)
