We recently released [PyMC3 3.1](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md#pymc3-31-june-23-2017) after the first stable 3.0 release in January 2017. You can update either via `pip install pymc3` or via `conda install -c conda-forge pymc3`.

A lot is happening in PyMC3-land. One thing I am particularily proud of is the developer community we have built. We now have around 10 active core contributors from the US, Germany, Russia, Japan and Switzerland. Specifically, since 3.0, Adrian Seyboldt, [Junpeng Lao](http://www.unifr.ch/psycho/staff/lao-junpeng) and Hannes Bathke have joined the team. Moreover, we have 3 Google Summer of Code students: [Maxime Kochurov](https://ferrine.github.io/.), who is working on Variational Inference; Bill Engels, who is working on Gaussian Processes, and Bhargav Srinivasa is implementing Riemannian HMC.

Moreover, PyMC3 is being seeing increased adoption in [academia](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&sciodt=0,5&cites=6936955228135731011&scipsc=&authuser=1&q=&scisbd=1), as well as in [industry](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/wiki/Testimonials).

Here, I want to highlight some of the new features of PyMC3 3.1.

## Discourse forum + better docs[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Discourse-forum-+-better-docs)

To facilitate the community building process and give users a place to ask questions we have a launched a discourse forum: [http://discourse.pymc.io](http://discourse.pymc.io/.). Bug reports should still onto the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues), but for all PyMC3 questions or modeling discussions, please use the discourse forum.

There are also some improvements to the documentation. Mainly, a [quick-start to the general PyMC3 API](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/api_quickstart.html), and a [quick-start to the variational API](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/variational_api_quickstart.html).




## Gaussian Processes[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Gaussian-Processes)

PyMC3 now as high-level support for GPs which allow for very flexible non-linear curve-fitting (among other things). This work was mainly done by Bill Engels with help from Chris Fonnesbeck. Here, we highlight the basic API, but for more information see the [full introduction](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/GP-introduction.html).

## Improvements to NUTS[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Improvements-to-NUTS)

NUTS is now identical to Stan's implementation and also much much faster. In addition, Adrian Seyboldt added [higher-order integrators](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/api/inference.html#module-pymc3.step_methods.hmc.nuts), which promise to be more efficient in higher dimensions, and [sampler statistics](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/sampler-stats.html) that help identify problems with NUTS sampling.

In addition, we changed the default kwargs of `pm.sample()`. By default, the sampler is run for 500 iterations with tuning enabled (you can change this with the `tune` kwarg), these samples are then discarded from the returned trace. Moreover, if no arguments are specified, `sample()` will draw 500 samples in addition to the tuning samples. So for almost all models, just calling `pm.sample()` should be sufficient.

`trace` now has a bunch of extra parameters pertaining to statistics of the sampler:

## Variational Inference[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Variational-Inference)

[Maxim "Ferrine" Kochurov](https://ferrine.github.io/.) has done outstanding contributions to improve support for Variational Inference. Essentially, Ferrine has implemented [Operator Variational Inference (OPVI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09033) which is a framework to express many existing VI approaches in a modular fashion. He has also made it much easier to supply mini-batches. See [here](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/variational_api_quickstart.html) for a full overview of the capabilities.

Specifically, PyMC3 supports the following VI methods:

- Auto-diff Variational Inference (ADVI) mean-field

- ADVI full rank

- Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)

- Armortized SVGD


In addition, Ferrine is making great progress on adding Flows which allows learning very flexible transformations of the VI approximation to learn more complex (i.e. non-normal) posterior distributions.

As you can see, we have also added a new high-level API in the spirit of `sample`: `pymc3.fit()` with many configuration options:

## Cholesky factorization[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Cholesky-factorization)

There is a nice trick to covariance estimation using the [Cholesky decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) for increased efficiency and numerical stability. The `MvNormal` distribution now accepts a Cholesky-factored covariance matrix. In addition, the LKJ prior has been changed to provide the Cholesky covariance matrix. Thus, if you are estimating covariances, definitely use this much improved parameterization.

## Live-trace to see sampling in real-time[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Live-trace-to-see-sampling-in-real-time)

This one is really cool, you can watch the trace evolve while its sampling using `pm.sample(live_plot=True)`. Contributed by David Brochart. See [here](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/live_sample_plots.html) for full docs.




## Better display of random variables[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Better-display-of-random-variables)

We now make use of the fancy display features of the Jupyter Notebook to provide a nicer view of RVs:

$γ \sim \text{Normal}(\mathit{mu}=μ, \mathit{sd}=f(σ))$





You can create greek letters in the Jupyter Notebook by typing the $\LaTeX$ command and hitting tab: \mu[tab].




## GPU support (experimental)[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#GPU-support-(experimental))

While still experimental, we have made a lot of progress towards fully supporting `float32` throughout. If you set `floatX = float32` in your `.theanorc`, cast all your input data to `float32` (e.g. by using `pm.floatX()` for automatic casting), you should get much faster inference. If you set the backend to use the GPU, you should get a nice speed-up on the right types of models. Please report any successes or failures in this regard.




## Other useful packages[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Other-useful-packages)

These are not part of PyMC3 3.1 but build on it and should be of interest to many users.




### Bayesian Deep Learning with Gelato[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Bayesian-Deep-Learning-with-Gelato)

Gelato bridges PyMC3 and Lasagne, a library to easily build Neural Networks similar to Keras. Building Bayesian convolution neural networks and estimating them using VI has never been simpler. See [here](https://github.com/ferrine/gelato/blob/master/examples/mnist.ipynb) for an example on MNIST.




### Building hierarchical GLMs with Bambi[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Building-hierarchical-GLMs-with-Bambi)

[Bambi](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi) is a new package on top of PyMC3 (they also recently added a Stan backend) which allows creation of complex, hierarchical GLMs with very intuitive syntax, e.g.:

`model.fit('rt ~ condition', random=['condition|subject', '1|stimulus'], samples=5000, chains=2)`.




## Looking towards PyMC3 3.2[¶](http://twiecki.github.com/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31#Looking-towards-PyMC3-3.2)

PyMC3 3.2 is already underway. Some of the features we are working on include:
