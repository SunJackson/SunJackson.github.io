Say that one day you're faced with a table of distance information
between a bunch of points. Just looking at the table doesn't really provide
any real information about the underlying structure of the data, so you want
to find a way to visualize this in a way thats more meaningful.

For instance take a look of this table of distances between US cities:
||Atlanta|Chicago|Denver|Houston|Los Angeles|Miami|New York|San Francisco|Seattle|Washington, DC
|Atlanta|0|587|1212|701|1936|604|748|2139|2182|543|
|Chicago|587|0|920|940|1745|1188|713|1858|1737|597|
|Denver|1212|920|0|879|831|1726|1631|949|1021|1494|
|Houston|701|940|879|0|1374|968|1420|1645|1891|1220|
|Los Angeles|1936|1745|831|1374|0|2339|2451|347|959|2300|
|Miami|604|1188|1726|968|2339|0|1092|2594|2734|923|
|New York|748|713|1631|1420|2451|1092|0|2571|2408|205|
|San Francisco|2139|1858|949|1645|347|2594|2571|0|678|2442|
|Seattle|2182|1737|1021|1891|959|2734|2408|678|0|2329|
|Washington, DC|543|597|1494|1220|2300|923|205|2442|2329|0|

 

While packed full of information, this doesn't really provide any context for the exact
relations between these cities. A much more useful visualization would be a
map of these points.

The challenge then is to produce coordinates for each item that best
approximate the distances in the table. This type of problem is well solved by a set of techniques called Multidimensional
Scaling (MDS). There is
a good overview of MDS
variants on the
page where I stole this example from, but we only really need the classic
version here. In this case, we just choose coordinates for each item such that
they minimize the squared error between euclidean distances of the
coordinates themselves and the entries in the distance matrix.

Finding these coordinates is actually a fairly simple calculation: you just square each value in the
distance matrix, double centre that such that the columns and rows both have a
zero mean, and then take the SVD of that matrix. The point coordinates are
then in the factors returned by the SVD. A full derivation of
this algorithm can be found
[here](http://www.stat.nthu.edu.tw/~swcheng/Teaching/stat5191/lecture/06_MDS.pdf)
for anybody thats interested in why this works.

Displaying the output of this algorithm using
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/), and a relatively sane looking output appears:





Obviously, the axes point in the opposite direction than
normal in this diagram, which is because I cheated a little to get the output
look a little more familiar. The raw distance matrix doesn't
encode orientation information, so this process produced a
set of coordinates that are the mirror image and rotated to what we're used
to. However, the relative distances between all the cities here are almost exactly correct, which is the goal here.

In javascript using [numeric.js](http://www.numericjs.com/), the code to produce these coordinates is
fairly concise:



### Applications to laying out Venn Diagrams

I first stumbled across this family of algorithms a couple of weeks ago when I
was reading a
[paper](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/Publications/venneuler.pdf) by Leland
Wilkinson for my post on
[laying out area proportional venn diagrams](https://www.benfrederickson.com/2013/05/09/venn-diagrams-with-d3.js.html).
We both had taken the approach of generating an initial layout for the venn
diagrams, and then optimizing that layout. While I just came up with a simple greedy
approach to generate the initial layout, he used MDS instead.

While my greedy approach usually worked really well, there was one example in the Wilkinson paper
where his approach was clearly superior:

![](http://www.benfrederickson.com/images/venneuler_fig7.png)


Aside from the 'B' and 'E' sets overlapping slightly here when they should be
disjoint, this diagram is basically perfect. The greedy version here is fairly
flawed in comparison - with the E set dangling off and not connecting to the D
set at all:


 Note: you need Javascript enabled and a SVG compatible browser to view the venn diagrams below 





Optimized Greedy Layout


The problem here is the E set is the last set laid out by the
greedy layout, since it has the least amount of overlap of any set in the
diagram. While it overlaps the D and F sets, they have been placed too far
apart for this set to bridge that gap, creating a layout with a local minima
that the local optimization technique I used couldn't step out of.

By calculating the appropriate euclidean distance between each pair of sets
numerically, and then passing that distance matrix to the MDS algorithm above,
we get a layout that can be optimized to a much better solution:






Its worth pointing out the Wilkinson paper uses MDS on the Jaccard distance between
the sets, rather than Euclidean distance I used here. This doesn't seem to
change the results though, both approaches lead to a very similar diagram.

### Conclusion

I've put my javascript
version up [on github](http://github.com/benfred/mds.js), and I've
also updated the [venn.js](http://github.com/benfred/venn.js) code to optionally use this as an initial layout.

I was about to use MDS by default for the venn.js
library, but the greedy layout seems to do a better job on most other
examples I tried. The problem seems to be that MDS spends an equal amount of effort trying
to get the distances right for small intersection areas, whereas the greedy
layout only looks at the largest intersections. Even in the example above the greedy
version actually produces a diagram with a much lower loss, it just doesn't
optimize as well as the MDS version.

Other MDS variants might overcome this
problem though. I looked at using a weighted MDS calculation, with
a vague notion of using the size of the set intersections as the weights to
use. Unfortunately, all
the information I could find about WMDS online was only talking about weighting the rows of the matrix
rather than the entries - and the primary research is behind an academic
paywall. Next time I'm
near a university library I probably see about getting it, but I'm stopping here in
the meantime.

While it didn't really solve my specific problem as well as I would have
liked, its still a cool algorithm.
