[In my previous post](http://www.investuotojas.eu/2012/01/30/the-power-of-rcpp), I tried to show, that Rcpp is 1000 faster than pure R and that generated the fuss in the comments. Being lazy, I didn’t vectorize R code and at the end I was comparing apples vs oranges.

To fix that problem, I built a new script, where I’m trying to compare apples against apples. First piece of code named “ifelse R” uses R “ifelse” function to vectorize code. Second piece of code is fully vectorized code written in R, third - pure C++ code and the last one is C++, where Rcpp “ifelse” function is used.

|| Name | Seconds 
|------
|| ifelse R | 27.50|
|| vectorized R | 10.40|
|| pure C++ | 0.44|
|| vectorized C++ | 2.24|

Here we go - vectorization truly helps, but pure C++ code still 23 times faster. Of course you pay the price when writing it in C++. I found a bit strange, that vectorized C++ code doesn’t perform that well…

You can get the code from [github](https://github.com/kafka399/Rproject/blob/master/performance/performance.R).
