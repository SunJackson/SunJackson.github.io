This weekend we ran [PyDataLondon 2018](https://pydata.org/london2018), the fifth iteration of our conference (connected with our monthly [PyDataLondon meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup)). This year we grew to 500 attendees! Read about the past [PyDataLondon 2017 here](http://ianozsvald.com/2017/06/01/pydatalondon-2017-conference-write-up).

**Updates** – [videos are online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJhj855tvQ&list=PLGVZCDnMOq0ovNxfxOqYcBcQOIny9Zvb-), reportedly we raised Â£91,000 towards open source support for NumFOCUS via ticket sales & sponsorship (all the London team are unpaid volunteers, this money goes back to NumFOCUS to support the PyData ecosystem).

Here’s a summary of what we covered with 500 attendees over 3 days:

On Thursday morning I [co-ran](https://twitter.com/cecilialiao/status/990160852715175936) a “Make your first open source contribution” with Nick (of [PyDataEdinburgh](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Edinburgh)). We had a group who’d rarely (or never) made a contribution to github. We managed to commit a [couple](https://github.com/tdda/tdda/pull/6) of minor [doc fixes](https://github.com/tdda/tdda/pull/7), [recreated a bug in ELI5](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5/issues/256) and subsequently a new (failing) test was [submitted](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5/pull/261) to the project. Great success! I’m interested in [another bug](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/68) if you want to make a [contribution](https://twitter.com/miguelmalvarez/status/990511369253478400).


Each room was packed with 150-200 people (with a comfy number of chairs for everyone!):


One of our key NumFOCUS organisers is Leah Silen, she’s an unsung hero who makes every conference come together. She broke her foot recently and couldn’t fly over. [It](https://twitter.com/sinayoko/status/990181876366237697) [turns](https://twitter.com/sinayoko/status/990181876366237697) out the [crowd](https://twitter.com/AngelJSalazar/status/990181960101351424) [rather](https://twitter.com/Peterfine/status/990181908012240896) [misses](https://twitter.com/oliverlaslett/status/990182101860470784) her and [all](https://twitter.com/cristohowlo/status/990181979088936960) of [her](https://twitter.com/mike_w_ai/status/990181796951228416) [work](https://twitter.com/huynhlouis/status/990181787841257472). Get well soon!

At the conference I spoke on “[Creating Correct and Capable Classifiers](https://pydata.org/london2018/schedule/presentation/32)” ([worked Notebook](https://github.com/ianozsvald/data_science_delivered/blob/master/ml_creating_correct_capable_classifiers.ipynb) in my github repo, [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6osKvhY6Ro&list=PLGVZCDnMOq0ovNxfxOqYcBcQOIny9Zvb-&index=23) online). We took a look at starting with a baseline model, building a better stable model, visualising errors, diagnosing where it might be failing and explaining the end results to a colleague.


Many thanks to @matti of PyDataBerlin for taking a lovely photo of our speaker-duck gift for speakers:
