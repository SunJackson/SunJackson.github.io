My latest work titled “Contagion dynamics of extremist propaganda in social networks” has been [published ](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025517305030)on Information Sciences. The study aims at modeling and understanding the diffusion of extremist propaganda, in particular content in support of ISIS, on social media like Twitter.[![](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fig4-300x169.png)

Starting from a list of twenty-five thousand annotated accounts that have been associated with ISIS and suspended by Twitter, we obtained a large Twitter dataset of over one million posts these users generated. We studied network and temporal activity patterns, and investigated the dynamics of social influence within ISIS supporters. [![](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fig8a-300x182.png)

To quantify the effectiveness of ISIS propaganda and determine the adoption of extremist content in the general population, we drew a parallel between radical propaganda and epidemics spreading. We identified information broadcasters and influential ISIS supporters and showed that they generate highly-infectious cascades of information contagion.
