In the [data science course](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT8) that I teach for General Assembly, we spend a lot of time using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable), Python's library for machine learning. I love teaching scikit-learn, but it has a **steep learning curve**, and my feeling is that there are not many scikit-learn resources that are targeted towards **machine learning beginners**. Thus I decided to create a series of scikit-learn video tutorials, which I launched in April in partnership with [Kaggle](http://blog.kaggle.com/author/kevin-markham), the leading online platform for competitive data science!

The series now contains **nine video tutorials** totaling **four hours**. My goal with this series is to help motivated individuals to gain a thorough grasp of both machine learning fundamentals and the scikit-learn workflow. **I don't presume any familiarity with machine learning**, which is why the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=1) focuses exclusively on answering the question, "What is machine learning, and how does it work?" And although the series does assume that you have some familiarity with Python, the [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXXlYVBt1M&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&index=2) contains my suggested resources for learning Python if you're just getting started with the language.

I've embedded the video playlist below, or you can [watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A). I've also listed the agenda for each video, along with links to the blog post and **Jupyter Notebook** associated with each video. (My [GitHub repository](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos) contains all of the Notebooks, which may be useful as reference material!)

**Update:** In 2018, I updated the notebooks to be compatible with scikit-learn 0.19.1 and Python 3.6. You can read about those changes [here](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-update-your-scikit-learn-code-for-2018).

I hope you enjoy the series, and welcome your **comments and questions**. Please [subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/dataschool?sub_confirmation=1) to be notified when new videos are released!
