### Rating Service

Going back to our domain model from earlier, I can see that users in my application can rate movies. We can use our Neo4j graph store as a way to index the connections between users and movies and later use that data to generate recommendations, a leading use case for graph databases.

Figure 6. The domain model shows how we can use a graph database to analyze the connections between movies and users

Using the Zuul enabled reverse proxy, let’s take a look at what the `Rating Service` exposes from Neo4j.

```
curl -X GET 'http://service.cfapps.io/rating'
```

```
{
 "_links": {
 "products": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/rating/products{?page,size,sort}",
 "templated": true
 },
 "ratings": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/rating/ratings{?page,size,sort}",
 "templated": true
 },
 "users": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/rating/users{?page,size,sort}",
 "templated": true
 },
 "profile": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/rating/alps",
 "templated": false
 }
 }
}
```

We see from the results that we have 3 repositories that are exposed through REST and HATEOAS. The `/rating/products` endpoint is a generic form of the `movie` domain entity from our other service. Later we may want to offer things other than movies, this generic term saves us from having to change the semantics later if we enter a new line of business and still need recommendations.

One of the key differences between our Spring Data JPA MySQL repository for movies is that a graph model has different underlying entity types that describe our data: nodes and relationships.

Let’s take a look at the `/rating/ratings` endpoint, which exposes the ratings of a user and movie.

```
...
"ratings": [
{
 "id": 87863,
 "timestamp": 881252305,
 "rating": 1,
 "_links": {
 "self": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/ratings/87863",
 "templated": false
 },
 "rating": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/ratings/87863",
 "templated": false
 },
 "user": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/ratings/87863/user",
 "templated": false
 },
 "product": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/ratings/87863/product",
 "templated": false
 }
 }
},
...
```

The rating repository shows each relationship that connects a user to a product, and what they rated the product. The ID used for the user and the product relates back to the unique ID used by our other services that manage parts of our domain data, such as `Movie Service` and `User Service`.

#### Custom Graph Queries

Depending on how our connected data is used, we can create repository endpoints that allow us to bind certain REST API endpoints to tailored queries that use Neo4j’s Cypher query language.

One such example is the requirement to find all ratings for a user. The Cypher query to do this could be:

```
MATCH (n:User)-[r:Rating]->() WHERE n.knownId = {id} RETURN r
```

Here we are matching the pattern where a user has rated something, starting at the user’s ID and returning a list of the relationship entities containing the attributes of the rating entity.

To bind this query to our Spring Data REST repository we would describe it as follows:

```
@RepositoryRestResource
public interface RatingRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Rating, Long> {
 @Query(value = "MATCH (n:User)-[r:Rating]->() WHERE n.knownId = {id} RETURN r")
 Iterable<Rating> findByUserId(@Param(value = "id") String id);
}
```

By registering this custom repository method, Spring Data REST will automatically register it as an embedded link in the rating’s REST repository. Let’s take a look.

```
curl -X GET "http://service.cfapps.io/rating/ratings/search/findByUserId?id=1"
```

The custom repository method will be added to the `rating` service’s `search` links. We can now call this new method by its name, as shown above.

```
{
 "_links": {
 "self": {
 "href": "http://service.cfapps.io/rating/ratings/search/findByUserId?id=1",
 "templated": false
 }
 },
 "_embedded": {
 "ratings": [
 {
 "id": 87863,
 "timestamp": 881252305,
 "rating": 1
 },
 ...
```
