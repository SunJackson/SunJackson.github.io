Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy for you to add a speech-to-text capability to your applications. You can use Amazon Transcribe to create text transcripts of audio and video files. Starting today, you can designate your own S3 buckets to store transcription outputs rather than S3 buckets maintained by the Amazon Transcribe service. This allows you to maintain finer-grained control of your data across your entire transcription workflow.

To use this feature, input the name of your designated S3 bucket into the **OutputBucketName** field when you create a job. Amazon Transcribe will then validate that the specified S3 bucket exists and that it has permission to write to that bucket before completing the transcription.

To learn more about this feature, visit [this documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/API_StartTranscriptionJob.html#transcribe-StartTranscriptionJob-request-OutputBucketName).
