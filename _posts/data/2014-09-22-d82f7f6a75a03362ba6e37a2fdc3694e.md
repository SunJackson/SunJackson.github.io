Demand for predictive apps is growing. There’s increasing awareness of the value that can be obtained from data with Machine Learning. At the same time, there’s a growing number of APIs that make ML accessible to the masses and that remove the barriers to entry to predictive app development.

Today, the predictive APIs and apps community has grown to a level where it deserves a practical conference dedicated to them. API makers are working hard at making the lives of developers simpler, so the event should connect them with those who make predictive apps. Beyond demonstrating these APIs, we need to focus on applications. If we want predictive technology to have real-world impact, it's important that predictive app developers share their stories, their challenges and how they're getting value from predictive.

Today, I’m very proud to announce that I will be chairing [PAPIs.io ’14](http://www.papis.io/), the 1st ever international conference dedicated to predictive APIs and predictive apps. Seeding a conference is no easy task and PAPIs would not be possible without the invaluable support of [Francisco Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cisko) (our Program Chair), [Ali Syed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaalee), and the members of the [Program Committee](http://www.papis.io/#committee) who are sharing our vision. We are also happy to count with the early support of great companies like [BigML](http://www.bigml.com/.), [CleverTask](http://www.clevertask.com/.), [Dataiku](http://www.dataiku.com/), [GCS Agile](http://www.gcsgroup.com.au/), [Persontyle](http://persontyle.com/), [Strands](http://strands.com/) and [Taiger](http://www.taiger.com/)!

**PAPIs.io '14 will take place on 17-18 November 2014 in Barcelona, Spain**, right before [Strata](http://strataconf.com/strataeu2014). There will be API tutorials on Monday 17 and conference sessions on Tuesday 18. We’ve got some great speakers lined up already, but there are still some slots to fill: click below if you want to propose something to present.
