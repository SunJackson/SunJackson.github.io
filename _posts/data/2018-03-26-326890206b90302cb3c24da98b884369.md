I just started a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-UC-nE8B33UGnC-NRaSfug). The hope is that this will be a companion to the blog. Some of the posts will “graduate” into videos (e.g., the first set of videos will correspond to an expanded version of bandit lecture notes –[part 1](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/05/11/bandit-theory-part-i), [part 2](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/05/13/bandit-theory-part-ii)-, and the second set will correspond to the crash course in learning theory –[part 1](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2015/10/13/crash-course-on-learning-theory-part-1), [part 2](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2015/10/22/crash-course-on-learning-theory-part-2)-). But the mid/long-term plan is to also have dedicated content on the youtube channel (I still have to figure out the exact format). I personally like a lot to watch math videos online, so I hope the channel will be a nice addition to this growing material (some of my favorite existing channels include the [Simons Institute](https://www.youtube.com/user/SimonsInstitute), [IAS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8aRaZ6_0weiS50pvCmo0pw), [Princeton TCS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyGLYDvZ5BD5oYCIVv995HA), [Harvard Math](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZgHOeJBfMKOZ5PMlZysy8Q), [IHES](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4R1IsRVKs_qlWKTm9pT82Q),  [a new MIT data science channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAjpUH2bSn5rF4PjMseZusw), feel free to add yours in the comments below).
