This spring, I taught a class on [Machine Learning the Future](http://hunch.net/~mltf) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) covering a number of advanced topics in machine learning including online learning, joint (structured) prediction, active learning, contextual bandit learning, logarithmic time prediction, and parallel learning. Each of these classes was recorded from the laptop via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and I just uploaded the recordings to [Youtube](http://youtube.com/.).

In some ways, this class is a followup to the [large scale learning class](http://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=courses:bigdata:start) I taught with [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/) 4 years ago. The videos for that class were taken down(*) so these lectures both update and replace shared subjects as well as having some new subjects. 

Much of this material is fairly close to research so to assist other machine learning lecturers around the world in digesting the material, I’ve made all the source available as well. Feel free to use and improve.

(*) The NYU policy changed so that students could not be shown in classroom videos.
