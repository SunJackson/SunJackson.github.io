I’m at [NIPS 2017](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017).
Please catch me or e-mail me if you’d like to chat about research!


I can also describe my experience in
the Bayesflow team at Google—TensorFlow meets Bayes which is led by Rif
Saurous and partially
[Kevin Murphy](https://research.google.com/pubs/KevinMurphy.html)—as
well as [David Blei’s group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei) at
Columbia. Both are always looking for excellent researchers as
postdocs, research scientists, and interns.

As advertisement, we’re fortunate to have two posters at the main conference:

At workshops, I’ll also be presenting three talks and two posters:

The [NIPS approximate inference workshop](http://approximateinference.org/.) will be quite a bit of fun this Friday @ Seaside Ballroom. Join us!

Finally, if you’d like to talk about current research, I’m *very*
excited to talk about the workshop papers and our recent probabilistic
programming work: [TensorFlow Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10604), and a coming book chapter on deep probabilistic programming with Vikash Mansinghka.

See you at the conference.
