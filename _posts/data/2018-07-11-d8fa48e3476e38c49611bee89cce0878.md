Mike Loukides, Hilary Mason, and DJ Patil published a first [post in a series on data ethics](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/doing-good-data-science) on O’Reilly. 

> We particularly need to think about the unintended consequences of our use of data. It will never be possible to predict all the unintended consequences; we’re only human, and our ability to foresee the future is limited. But plenty of unintended consequences could easily have been foreseen: for example, Facebook’s “Year in Review” that [reminded people of deaths and other painful events](http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2014/12/facebook-apologizes-for-highlighting-painful-memories-with-year-in-review-feature.html). Moving fast and breaking things is unacceptable if we don’t think about the things we are likely to break. And we need the space to do that thinking: space in project schedules, and space to tell management that a product needs to be rethought.

Because data might just be computer output — cold and mechanical — but what data represents and the things it leads to are not.
