We end 2017 with a round-up of some of the research, talks, sci-fi,
visualizations/art, and a grab bag of other stuff we found particularly
interesting, enjoyable, or influential this year.

### Research

2017 saw renewed interest in using the human brain as an inspiration for
machine learning — perhaps most notably, Dynamic Routing Between Capsule
Networks by Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton.

Somewhat to counter this trend (and Hinton’s criticism of stochastic gradient
descent based on its biological implausibility) and to highlight necessary
foundational work, we recommend two papers from Arpit, Jastrzębski, and
collaborators: Memorization in Deep Neural
Networks and The Factors Influencing Minima
in SGD (with practical suggestions for
developers) are beautiful examples of foundational work the field needs now
that neural networks have proven to be effective applied problem solvers.

Work on influence functions and adversarial
examples helps us understand
both what neural networks learn *and* their fragility. As more models are
pushed into production, it’s more important to understand the vulnerabilities.
Indeed our own
research
built on separate academic work that highlighted the importance and value of of
model interpretability.

On the infrastructure and engineering side, we’re excited about serverless in
general, and PyWren in particular. PyWren is a tool which uses a serverless
backend (AWS Lambda in this case) to offer data scientists a simple,
inexpensive and scalable mapreduce. PyWren is presented in Occupy the cloud:
distributed computing for the 99%. The
upsides and downsides of serverless are examined in Serverless Computing:
Economic and Architectural
Impact.

### Talks

Aaron Levin’s Finding Friends in High Dimensions: Locality-Sensitive Hashing
For Fun and Friendliness! was a
fast (and funny!) introduction to an important algorithm. Aaron delivered this
talk at [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/), which is hands-down our favorite
programming conference.

Joel Grus’s Livecoding Madness - Let’s Build a Deep Learning
Library was dazzling.

### Sci-fi

N.K. Jemisin completed her Broken Earth trilogy with The Stone
Sky, and
it was the best sci-fi we read this year. While not directly related to AI, it
explores consequences of a society shaped by technology inherited from the
past.

[Autonomous](https://smile.amazon.com/Autonomous-Annalee-Newitz/dp/0765392089)
by Annalee Newitz is an interesting look at bio-hacking and robot
relationships.

### Visualization/Art

[Kyle McDonald’s twitter account](https://twitter.com/kcimc) is not just about
visualization (e.g., his dispatches from NIPS were fascinating), but we
particularly love it when he shares his work looking at data. This thread on
how people draw everyday objects varies by
country, and this thread showing
music tempo by year as a
heatmap to demonstrate
the arrival of the drum machine, were highlights.

Speaking of the drum machine, the Google Brain team got great-sounding
results
with Music
VAE.

[Zach Lieberman’s visual sketches](https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman)
have been great, especially the AR stuff.

[Mario Kligemann](https://twitter.com/quasimondo) does interesting work with
Generative Adversarial Networks, among other things.

### Everything else

We thought about putting the web (and now mobile) game Universal
Paperclips in the
sci-fi section of this list. It’s a fun game to discover and beat, but it’s
also a fascinating look at the infamous Paperclip
Maximizer artificial
intelligence thought experiment.

Data & Society’s report on Media Manipulation and Disinformation
Online
shows how extremist groups attempt to hack the attention economy. And in a year
during which harassment and discrimination was never far from the news, Susan
Fowler’s powerful
testimony
on her time at Uber and Leah Fessler’s Your company’s Slack is probably
sexist
were especially important to our community. We urge everyone who works in tech
to reflect on these pieces.

Finally, we wish you all a very happy holidays and look forward to sharing our
work with you next year!
