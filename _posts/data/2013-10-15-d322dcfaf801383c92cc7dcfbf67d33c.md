So I decided to write a GraphGist to help Neo4j developers do recommendations by logging events within a "Time Scale Graph". 

The goal of this GraphGist is to provide you with a lens to help you see information as simple temporal facts that are captured across space and time.

You can find the full GraphGist [here](http://gist.neo4j.org/?github-kbastani%2Fgists%2F%2Fmeta%2FTimeScaleEventMetaModel.adoc)
