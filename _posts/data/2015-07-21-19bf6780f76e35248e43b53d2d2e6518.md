It’s now been one month or so since we published the original [Inceptionism blog post](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html) and the associated [gallery of images](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB). Two weeks later we also published [the deepdream source code](https://github.com/google/deepdream).

And finally folks started also training novel networks too on new data sets, which is really the way to get more out of DeepDream.
