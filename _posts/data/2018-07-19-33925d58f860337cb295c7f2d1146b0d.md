h1. Railscamp

p(meta). 22 July 2009

I just came back from "railscamp":http://railscamps.com New England edition. It was one of the best programming events I have been to. It was a mix of a hackfest, tech talks, binge drinking, and LAN parties. One of the things that made it great was that there was no internet. It was in the middle of the woods up in Maine, fortunately "qrush":http://twitter.com/qrush brought a copy of all the rubyforge gems so we were able to continue hacking away on our projects.

I'm sure there have been other events like this, but this is the first time I experienced it, I definitely think there should be more events like this. It allowed everyone to get to know eachother very well in a short period of time. The event was for a weekend, not too long or too short. The only thing I would have changed is to make it a little bigger, maybe 50 people, there were about 30 people there. Any bigger and you would have lost the intimacy.

The event was purposely loosely organized, which made it awesome, we spent most of the day hacking away at code sprinkled in with a few talks about various projects. Then at night we drank, had a LAN party, and played some werewolf. Railscamp was held at Maine MountainView House in Bryant Pond, Maine. "Pat Allan":http://twitter.com/Pat and "Brian Cardarella":http://twitter.com/bcardarella put up the event, but it could not have been so much fun without everyone there, thanks guys! I highly recommend that other ruby groups put up theses events, I would definetly go! 

I also uploaded a bunch of "pictures.":http://www.flickr.com/photos/22036754@N03/sets/72157621657322715/
