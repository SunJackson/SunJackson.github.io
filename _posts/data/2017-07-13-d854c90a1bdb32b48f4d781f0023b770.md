Cloudera is pleased to announce that [Cloudera Enterprise 5.12 is now generally available](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads.html) (GA). The release includes enhancements for running in cloud environments (with broader ADLS support and improved AWS Spot Instance support), usability and productivity improvements for both data science and analytic workloads, as well as performance gains and self-service performance management across a range of workloads. 

As usual, there are also a number of quality enhancements, bug fixes, and other improvements across the stack. Here is a partial list of what’s included (see the [Release Notes](http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/rg_release_notes.html) for a full list):



Core Platform

- **Improved AWS Spot Instance Support:** Cloudera Director 2.5 makes using AWS Spot Instance much easier and more reliable. Director can now recover from Spot instances disappearing during initial cluster spin up, grow operations, and in steady state. In addition, Cloudera Manager can be made aware of Spot instances for improved job reliability.

- **OpenStack Reference Architecture:** Cloudera Enterprise now enables customers to spin up/down clusters faster and more easily by supporting clusters running on OpenStack. The new OpenStack Reference Architecture complements the existing VMWare Reference Architecture for running Cloudera Enterprise on virtual infrastructure.

- **Backup and Disaster Recovery Enhancements:** BDR now makes it easier to diagnose and fix connectivity issues in Kerberized environments, provides more robust replication of Hive metadata, and supports longer running replication jobs by automatically renewing Kerberos tickets and Hadoop delegation tokens.


**Cloudera Data Science Workbench** enhancements include:

- **GPU Support:** Cloudera Data Science Workbench now enables popular deep learning frameworks to run on GPUs, both on-premises and in the cloud.

- **Embedded Web UIs:** Users can work with the Apache Spark Web UI for Spark sessions. Other interactive web applications like TensorBoard, Shiny, and Plotly now appear directly in the workbench.

- **Enhanced Job Scheduling:** Cloudera Data Science Workbench users can now schedule jobs directly from external schedulers or orchestration systems via the new Jobs API.


- **Kudu Function/Performance Improvements** *(also applies to Analytic DB)*: Support has been added for timestamps, both directly through Apache Kudu and indirectly through Apache Impala. New supportability tools have been developed for correcting under-replicated tablets and for system checks. Performance enhancements to Kudu include improved bulk loading and improved behavior on denser nodes.

- **HBase Cloud Storage support and Spark Integration**: Apache HBase now has ADLS support and recommendations for Azure deployment. Outside of cloud, HBase now has support for long-lived Spark applications via token renewal.


- **Usage-Enriched Query Assistance: **Hue now integrates with Navigator Optimizer to provide intelligent recommendations for more efficient SQL query design. SQL developers immediately receive recommendations based on popular usage and access patterns, as well as Impala and Hive best practices for optimized query performance.

- **Enhanced Analytic Workbench Interface: **The updated Hue 4.0 provides a modernized, intuitive experience for SQL users that enables greater productivity and a seamless workflow.

- **Added Cloud-Native Integrations and Faster SQL Analytics across Environments: **Impala now supports Microsoft ADLS for cloud-native analytics and continues to see performance and efficiency gains across all storage options (Amazon S3, Microsoft ADLS, HDFS, Kudu).
