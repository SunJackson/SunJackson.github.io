In the past few days I spent time migrating the blog from
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/.) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The theme builds off
[Type Theme](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type), and is
heavily inspired by [Otoro](http://blog.otoro.net/), the New York
Times, and the
[Rosenrot](http://the-rosenrot.com/). The annals-like frontpage takes
cue from Paul Graham’s [essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)
and Cosma Shalizi’s [notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks).

Hooray for math! (using KaTeX)

Hooray for code snippets! (taken from [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/getting-started))

```
def set_seed(x):
 """Set seed for both NumPy and TensorFlow.

 Parameters
 ----------
 x : int, float
 seed
 """
 np.random.seed(x)
 tf.set_random_seed(x)

```

Hooray for bibliographies!
…
Okay I don’t quite have that one set up yet. But it’s
doable!

The blog’s permalinks are the same. The [RSS feed](http://dustintran.com/blog/rss) is the same.

I liked Ghost, having migrated from Wordpress and with the impression of a
sleeker and more modern content management system (CMS). But CMS’ have
always been a bother for me because I could never understand the
internals. It would always be a reliance on plugins in order to
accomplish things. Even with Ghost some things were too automagical
and hidden to the user.

Time to go even more bare-bones with a static site generator.
[All code and content for this blog is available](https://github.com/dustinvtran/blog).

Here’s to hoping the redesign motivates me to write more often!
