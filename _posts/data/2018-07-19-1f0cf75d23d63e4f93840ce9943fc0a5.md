Hello!! Latest update on my Ruby profiler: I published a documentation site!! It’s at
[https://rbspy.github.io](https://rbspy.github.io/.).

I wanted to do a good job of this because my view about documentation is – if software isn’t well
documented, it might as well not exist. I’ve spent SO MUCH time explaining other people’s software
on this blog, so I figured it was extra important to make sure the software I write is well
explained.

It has all the usual things: what is this software? How does it work? It also has a few extra things
that I don’t always see on documentation sites though.

### stackprof vs ruby

Extra thing 1: there’s a comparison ([rbspy vs stackprof](https://rbspy.github.io/rbspy-vs-stackprof)) between rbspy and [stackprof](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof),
another Ruby profiler. This is not because rbspy is awesome and stackprof is bad (stackprof is very
useful!), but because rbspy and stackprof are useful in **different situations** and so I wanted to
explain when you should use each one!

### guide to profiling in general

The other extra thing I included is a small **guide to profiling**. This is because
I’ve heard from a lot of people who want to make their programs faster that they’re confused about
some of the basics of profiling – what’s the difference between a benchmark and a profiler? What’s
a flamegraph and how do I interpret it?

All of this documentation could actually apply to **any** profiling tool, not just rbspy. Here’s are
the pages from the guide to profiling:

### how I made the docs site

I wanted to have a really simple, pretty minimalist site. Nothing fancy! I did want it to feel like
there was a little bit of care put into it, though. Here’s how I did it.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/.), which is my favorite static site generator. It’s what I use for
this blog as well.

Next, I used the [Crisp theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/crisp), which I found by searching for
“minimalist” on the Hugo themes site. It’s already responsive, which was good – I wanted the site
to work on mobile.

Then I manually edited the HTML/CSS in theme a bit to get what I wanted. The main change I made was
to add a hamburger menu on mobile to make it (hopefully) easier to navigate. I used [this example](https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP). My CSS skills aren’t great (I’ve only written
HTML/CSS for tiny projects like this) so I was pretty proud of myself for getting the hamburger menu
working :)

Here’s what the site looks like on mobile! Look, responsive! :D

### Let me know if you have questions about rbpsy!

If there are questions you have about using rbspy that this docs site doesn’t answer, please let me
know!! I think documentation is really important, and if you have a question probably other people
do too :). I’d love to add to the [FAQ](https://rbspy.github.io/using-rbspy#faq).

I’m [[email protected]](https://jvns.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), or [@b0rk](https://twitter.com/b0rk) on Twitter.
