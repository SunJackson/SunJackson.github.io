#### Linear Models

***Use Cases: ***Classification and Regression

Linear models take X values and produce a line of best fit used for classification and regression of Y values. For example if you have a list of house sizes and their price in a neighborhood you can predict the price of house given the size using a linear model.

One thing to note is that linear models can be used for multiple X features. For example in the housing example we can create a linear model given house sizes, how many rooms, how many bathrooms and price and predict price given a house with size, # of rooms, # of bathrooms.
