(this is one of the projects of the *[#openimpact shortlist](http://blog.datalook.io/openimpact-project-shortlist)*)

Adopt-a-hydrant allows citizens to claim responsibility for shoveling out fire hydrants after heavy snowfall. In the midst of winter snowstorms, buried hydrants cause dangerous delays for fire fighters. But having City of Boston employees check and clear thousands of hydrants would be a timely, costly and burdensome process. Adopt-a-Hydrant lets governments look to community members for help. This map-based web app allows individuals, small businesses and community organizations to volunteer in shoveling out specific hydrants.
