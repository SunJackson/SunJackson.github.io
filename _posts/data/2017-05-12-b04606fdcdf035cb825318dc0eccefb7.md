Security is important. So important, that Google will downgrade the position of your website if you do not have an SSL certificate. In the past, there was a big SSL certificate market where you could buy a certificate from many resellers. Luckily this process is a lot easier nowadays and in this post I will explain you how you can use a tool made by Mozilla and many others to get your free SSL certificate.



[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) was build on top of Let’s Encrypt to automate the process of requesting an SSL certificate. The website of Certbot is self-explaining. You can choose your webserver and operating system et voilà! There is your free, self-updating SSL certificate!

So, what is the purpose of this blog post if everything is already self-explaining? I would like to make people aware of the fact that it is easy and free to obtain a SSL certificate. I know many developers who have never heard of this initiative. So therefore, I think it is important to share these resources.

If you experience some issues while using Certbot or if you have any questions or discussion points, please let me know.
