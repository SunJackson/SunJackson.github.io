I want to hire some people to help me update my websites more frequently, do the maintenance stuff, and to help edit the podcast so I can produce episodes more frequently. 

I outlined my whole plan here on [my Patreon Campaign](https://www.patreon.com/becomingdatasci). You’ll see a new page on this site soon acknowledging supporters, and I’ll update you on the progress.

Whether you can give financially, or even if you just share the campaign with your data science friends, you are helping Becoming a Data Scientist podcast, the learning club, Data Sci Guide, Jobs for New Data Scientists, and all of my websites get off the ground! Thank you!!
