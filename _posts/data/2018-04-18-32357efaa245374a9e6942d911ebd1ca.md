The alternative title of this blog post is `HIBPwned` version 0.1.7 has
been released! W00t!. Steph’s `HIBPwned`
package utilises the
[HaveIBeenPwned.com API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) to check
whether email addresses and/or user names have been present in any
publicly disclosed data breach. In other words, this package potentially
delivers bad news, but useful bad news!

This release is mainly a maintenance release, with some cool code
changes invisible to you, the user, but not only that: you can now get
`account_breaches` for several accounts in a `data.frame` instead of a
list, and you’ll be glad to know that results are cached inside an
active R session. You can read about more functionalities of the package
in the [function reference](https://itsalocke.com/hibpwned/reference).

Wouldn’t it be a pity, though, to echo the release
notes
without a nifty use case? Another blog post will give more details about
the technical aspects of the release, but here, let’s make you curious!
How many CRAN package maintainers have been
[pwned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn)?

Data was gathered thanks to an adaptation of the code published in this
blog post of David Smith’s about prolific package
maintainers.
*We* are after the most endangered package maintainers on CRAN!

The helper function below extracts the email address of a string such as
“Jane Doe [jane.doe@fakedomain.io](mailto:jane.doe@fakedomain.io)”. On top of using the `as.person`
conversion, this function also deals with a few particular cases.

```
get_maintainer_email <- function(maintainer_string){
 if(inherits(maintainer_string, "data.frame")){
 maintainer_string <- maintainer_string$Maintainer[1]
 }
 
 if(maintainer_string != "ORPHANED"){
 maintainer_string <- stringr::str_replace_all(maintainer_string,
 '"', '')
 maintainer_string <- stringr::str_replace_all(maintainer_string,
 ',', '')
 # particular case!
 maintainer_string <- stringr::str_replace_all(maintainer_string,
 'Berlin School of Economics and Law', '')
 maintainer <- as.person(maintainer_string)
 maintainer$email
 }else{
 ""
 }
 
}
```

Here it is in action.

```
get_maintainer_email("Jane Doe <jane.doe@fakedomain.io>")
#> [1] "jane.doe@fakedomain.io"
```

The following code then gathers the email addresses of all CRAN package
maintainers.

```
tools::CRAN_package_db() %>%
 .[, c("Package", "Maintainer")] %>%
 tidyr::nest(Maintainer, .key = "Maintainer") %>%
 # get the email out of the maintainer
 dplyr::mutate(email = purrr::map_chr(Maintainer,
 get_maintainer_email)) %>%
 dplyr::select(- Maintainer) %>%
 # only keep the ones with email
 dplyr::filter(email != "") %>%
 # save result
 readr::write_csv(path = "data/all_packages.csv")
```

```
emails <- readr::read_csv("data/all_packages.csv")
```

We obtained 12444 packages with 7173 unique email addresses. We do not
have to care about their uniqueness: since `HIBPwned` implements caching
inside an active R session via
[`memoise`](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) duplicate emails do not
mean duplicate requests! :nail_care: Another aspect we users do not
need to care about is rate limiting: `HIBPwned` uses the nice
[`ratelimitr` package](https://github.com/tarakc02/ratelimitr) in order
to automatically pause R when needed.

Thanks to setting the new `as_list` option to FALSE we get a data.frame
as output. Note that choosing this means we only get back accounts with
breaches. Depending on the analysis, we could supplement the original
`emails` data.frame with the information using `dplyr::left_join` for
instance.

```
pwned <- HIBPwned::account_breaches(emails$email,
 as_list = FALSE)
pwned <- unique(pwned)
```

There are 7173 unique CRAN maintainer emails, among which 3613 i.e. 50%
have been pwned. Dear reader, why not compare this to the proportion of
Python module maintainers who’ve been pwned? Ping us if you complement
this analysis!

Looking at these pwned maintainers, here are the number of breaches
they’ve been victims of:

```
pwned %>%
 dplyr::count(account) %>%
 dplyr::summarise(median = median(n),
 min = min(n),
 max = max(n)) %>%
 knitr::kable()
```

|median|min|max
|------
|2|1|18|

There are 136 unique breaches. What were the most common ones?

```
pwned %>%
 dplyr::group_by(Title, BreachDate) %>%
 dplyr::tally() %>%
 dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) %>%
 head(10) %>%
 knitr::kable()
```

|Title|BreachDate|n
|------
|Dropbox|2012-07-01|1534|
|LinkedIn|2012-05-05|1140|
|Onliner Spambot|2017-08-28|943|
|GeekedIn|2016-08-15|782|
|Adobe|2013-10-04|694|
|MDPI|2016-08-30|558|
|Last.fm|2012-03-22|350|
|NetProspex|2016-09-01|310|
|B2B USA Businesses|2017-07-18|279|
|Disqus|2012-07-01|259|

Maybe or probably some you’ve heard of, which might make you wonder
about your own security, being a CRAN maintainer or not…

You could check if you’ve been victim of any known breach right now by
installing `HIBPwned` from CRAN!

```

If one of your addresses has been pwned, Steph says you should change
passwords in other locations is you re-used passwords. Even if your
address hasn’t been pwned yet you should use a password manager that
will allow you not to re-use passwords, and set up two factor
authentication, e.g. read more about 2FA for
GitHub.

And how could you now right away if a known data breach is of concern to
you? Well, don’t only let your .Rprofile tell you you’re a rrrrock
star, but
also add some code checking whether you’ve been pwned, as explained in
this blog
post!
Pro-tip, you can use the `usethis::edit_r_profile` function to easily
open your .Rprofile. Steph also says you can register for HIBPwned.com
notifications and ask your
organisation to watch breaches at the domain level. Stay safe!
