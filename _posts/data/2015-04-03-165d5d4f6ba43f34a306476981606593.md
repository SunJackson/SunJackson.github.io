If you look closely at the code, you will notice the beta PDF (a PDF is just a function that will tell you the relative likelihood of a random variable to take a given value; so in the above PDF you can see that 0.5 has a relatively high likelihood) takes 2 parameters - we will call them $\alpha$ and $\beta$. With these two parameters we know the PDF of a beta function as: $$\propto x^{\alpha - 1}(1 - x)^{\beta - 1}$$ This formula comes directly from the Wikipedia link. You will notice, though, that I excluded the denominator in the formula. Thus, I said proportional to. In almost all PDF formulas the denominator is the normalizing constant. The normalizing constant is basically what makes sure the PDF integrates to 1 as a probability distribution must. And because it is a constant we can ignore it if we only want relative likelihoods and not actual probability values.

The wikipedia link has a good picture that shows how the PDF of the beta distribution changes as we change $\alpha$ and $\beta$. So how do we pick values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$?

We know (see Wikipedia) that the mean value of a beta PDF is $$\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$$ Thus, in our picture above with $\alpha=2$ and $\beta=2$, we get a mean value of .5.

And the variance is: $$\frac{\alpha \beta}{(\alpha + \beta)^{2}(\alpha + \beta + 1)}$$ So for our parameters, we get a value of $$\frac{4}{80}=.05$$ And with a beta distribution, when $\alpha = \beta > 1$ you will always get a symmetric distribution centered around 1/2. This is good for our coin flipping example if we think our prior is a fair coin. As we increase $\alpha$ and $\beta$ our variance will get smaller, which means we have more confidence in our prior belief that our coin is fair.

Note: There are many ways to pick $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Another way I have seen is to:

let $m$ = prior belief of probability of heads

let $n$ = the number of data points used to calculate your $m$ value. If you didn't use data, then basically set $n$ higher if you are more confident in your prior. Then:

$$\beta = (1-m)n$$

In the code below you can see this in action
