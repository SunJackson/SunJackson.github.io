It turns out that [Converting categorical data into numbers with Pandas and Scikit-learn](http://fastml.com/converting-categorical-data-into-numbers-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn) has become the most [popular](http://fastml.com/popular) article on this site. Let’s revisit the topic and look at Pandas’ get_dummies() more closely.

Using the function is straightforward - you specify which columns you want encoded and get a dataframe with original columns replaced with one-hot encodings.

```
df_with_dummies = pd.get_dummies( df, columns = cols_to_transform )

```

Naturally, there will be more columns in the new frame. They will have names corresponding to the original column and its values. For example, `car` will be replaced with `car_Audi`, `car_BMW`, `car_Mercedes` etc.

What if the test set is small and some values are absent? Or it has new values not present in the training set, for example *Volkswagen*?

Two solutions come to mind. One is two `pd.concat(( train, test ))`, `get_dummies()` and then split the set back. If columns sets in train and test differ, you can extract and concatenate just the categorical columns to encode.

Another way is to add the missing columns, filled with zeros, and delete any extra columns. For this to work, one first needs a list of original `columns`. We pass the frame to fix and a list of columns to the following function:

```
def add_missing_dummy_columns( d, columns ):
 missing_cols = set( columns ) - set( d.columns )
 for c in missing_cols:
 d[c] = 0

```

By default Python passes non-scalar object by reference - meaning the function operates on the original. And so it modifies `d` in place and returns nothing. This is a matter of taste and can be easily changed.

We also need to remove any extra columns and reorder the remaining ones to match the original setup:

```
def fix_columns( d, columns ): 

 add_missing_dummy_columns( d, columns )

 # make sure we have all the columns we need
 assert( set( columns ) - set( d.columns ) == set())

 extra_cols = set( d.columns ) - set( columns )
 if extra_cols:
 print "extra columns:", extra_cols

 d = d[ columns ]
 return d

```

Now for some informal testing.

```
def fix_columns_test():

 n_cols = 4
 n_rows = 5

 columns = [ "col_{}".format( x ) for x in range( n_cols )]

 # create the "new" set of columns
 new_columns = columns[:] # copy
 new_columns.pop()
 new_columns.append( 'col_new' ) 

 # create the "new" dataframe
 n = np.random.random(( n_rows, n_cols ))
 d = pd.DataFrame( n, columns = new_columns )

 print d
 print "\n", columns

 fixed_d = fix_columns( d.copy(), columns )
 print "\n", fixed_d

 assert( list( fixed_d.columns ) == columns )

```

By the way, if you happen to be using `get_dummies( ..., drop_first = True )`, you might want to think over the process described above to make sure everything works as expected.
