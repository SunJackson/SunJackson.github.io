I’m on the CodeNewbie podcast this week talking about [how the Internet works](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/how-does-the-internet-work) –
we talked about TCP, UDP, netcat, and a few other things. CodeNewbie is a podcast for people who are
just getting started with programming. I was excited about doing this podcast because I feel like
often people don’t learn about things like computer networking for a long time (I didn’t learn
anything about how TCP worked until I’d been programming for 10 years!) but I think a lot of
systems-y concepts are both really interesting and pretty approachable.

I feel like there’s a certain segment of people who get into programming partly because they just
want to know how things *work* (what is my computer DOING when I get a website?!?). Obviously I am
a little like this, and I have a special love for networking because it’s EVERYWHERE and I find it
very satisfying to know how it works. So I wanted to introduce a little bit of that to some
beginning programmers.

I tried to keep it pretty introductory – if you’re interested in knowing how the internet works but
are unclear on what “TCP” is, maybe this will help a little! I thought Saron did a fantastic job of
asking questions throughout.
