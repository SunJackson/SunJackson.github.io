Rotation could be defined as a matrix multiplication in Cartesian coordinates, the following matrix rotates data in counter-clockwise by $\theta$;
$$ R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

For clockwise, $\theta$ only gets replaced by $-\theta$.

If we want to rotate x and y axises with $\theta$ degree, the matrix equality could be written:
$$ 
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then, new $x'$ and $y'$ is immediate as in the following:
$$
x' = x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta\
$$

If we want to learn the rotation in the signal by just looking at the data(assuming the original signal has principal components in the $x$ any $y$ axises), we could do that using PCA. As PCA will try to "normalize" the data into the axises along with principal components, we could look at the angle difference between the normalized axises to measure the rotation. If we are interested in measuring the strangeth of each principal component, PCA will give the explained variance along the process as well.
