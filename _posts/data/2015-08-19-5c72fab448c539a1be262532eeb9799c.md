[Cross-validation iterators](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation-iterators) in scikit-learn are simply generator objects, that is, Python objects that implement the `__iter__` method and that for each call to this method return (or more precisely, `yield`) the indices or a boolean mask for the train and test set. Hence, implementing new cross-validation iterators that behave as the ones in scikit-learn is easy with this in mind. Here goes a small code snippet that implements a holdout cross-validator generator following the scikit-learn API. 

Contrary to other cross-validation schemes, holdout relies on a single split of the data. It is well known than in practice holdout performs much worse than KFold or LeaveOneOut schemes. However, holdout has the advantage that its theoretical properties are easier to derive. For examples of this see e.g. Section 8.7 of [Theory of classification: a survey of some recent advances](http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/PS/PS_2005__9_/PS_2005__9__323_0/PS_2005__9__323_0.pdf) and the very recent [The reusable holdout](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6248/636.short).
