I have been getting great feedback on my [“Becoming a Data Scientist” Flipboard magazine](https://flipboard.com/@becomingdatasci/becoming-a-data-scientist-5ktft1lky), and I had this other set of articles bookmarked that didn’t quite fit into it. I want the Becoming a Data Scientist one to be the “best of the best” of articles I find on Twitter about data science, and to focus on understanding data science and related topics without getting too into the “nitty gritty”. However, I often come across great data science related tutorials on very specific topics that may not have broad appeal (and might look scary to beginners) but I also wanted to share. 

So I started the [“Data Science Related Tutorials” Flipboard magazine](https://flipboard.com/@becomingdatasci/data-science-related-tutorials-1h97ri85y). Enjoy!
