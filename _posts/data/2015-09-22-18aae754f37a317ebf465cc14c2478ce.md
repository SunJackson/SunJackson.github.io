The MIMIC II database demo is a subset of 4,000 (of over 32,000) patients from the MIMIC II database. These data are located here: [http://physionet.org/mimic2/demo/](http://physionet.org/mimic2/demo).

No living patients are included in the demo subset (although many of these patients lived for up to several years followingi their ICU admissions documented in this data set). Although these data are exempt from HIPAA requirements for protecting health information of living individuals, the data have been very carefully deidentified, and we have removed free-text notes and reports as a further measure to reduce the possibility of disclosing information that might be used to identify these patients.

The data can be obtained as a disk image that includes Ubuntu 10.04, PostgreSQL 8.4.8, pgadmin3 1.10.2, and MIMIC II v2.6 with data for 4000 patients. This disk image can then be loaded via [Virtual Box.](https://www.virtualbox.org/) Note: Make sure to select the install option when booting the first time in virtualbox. And the next time you boot, boot from disk.
