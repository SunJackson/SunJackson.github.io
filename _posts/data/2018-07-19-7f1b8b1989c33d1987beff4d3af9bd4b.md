There have been a few recommendations datasets for movies (Netflix, Movielens) and music (Million Songs), but not for books. That is, until now.










![](http://fastml.com/images/goodbooks.jpg)


The dataset contains six million ratings for ten thousand most popular books (with most ratings). There are also:

- books marked to read by the users

- book metadata (author, year, etc.)

- tags/shelves/genres


As to the source, let’s say that these ratings come from a site similar to goodreads.com, but with more permissive terms of use.

## Contents

There are a few types of data here:

- explicit ratings

- implicit feedback indicators (books marked to read)

- tabular data (book info)

- tags


For a quick exploratory analysis of the data, see the [notebook](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/quick_look.ipynb).

[ratings.csv](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/samples/ratings.csv) contains ratings sorted by time. It is 69MB and looks like that:

```
user_id,book_id,rating
1,258,5
2,4081,4
2,260,5
2,9296,5
2,2318,3

```

Ratings go from one to five. Both book IDs and user IDs are contiguous. For books, they are 1-10000, for users, 1-53424.

[to_read.csv](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/samples/to_read.csv) provides IDs of the books marked “to read” by each user, as *user_id,book_id* pairs, sorted by time. There are close to a million pairs.

[books.csv](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/samples/books.csv) has metadata for each book (goodreads IDs, authors, title, average rating, etc.). The metadata have been extracted from goodreads XML files, available in [books_xml](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/tree/master/books_xml).

### Tags

In [raw XML files](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/tree/master/books_xml), tags look like this:

```
<popular_shelves>
 <shelf name="science-fiction" count="833"/>
 <shelf name="fantasy" count="543"/>
 <shelf name="sci-fi" count="542"/>
 ...
 <shelf name="for-fun" count="8"/>
 <shelf name="all-time-favorites" count="8"/>
 <shelf name="science-fiction-and-fantasy" count="7"/> 
</popular_shelves>

```

[book_tags.csv](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/samples/book_tags.csv) contains tags/shelves/genres assigned to books by users. Tags in this file are represented by their IDs. They are sorted by *goodreads_book_id* ascending and *count* descending.

```
goodreads_book_id,tag_id,count
1,30574,167697
1,11305,37174
1,11557,34173

```

[tags.csv](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/blob/master/samples/tags.csv) translates tag IDs to names.

```
tag_id,tag_name
0,-
19,--your-message-here--
25,-fiction
26,-fictional
27,-fictitious

```

## Goodreads book and work IDs

Each book may have many editions. *goodreads_book_id* and *best_book_id* generally point to the most popular edition of a given book, while goodreads *work_id* refers to the book in the abstract sense.

You can use the goodreads book and work IDs to create URLs to see the difference:

[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052)
[https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/2792775](https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/2792775)

Note that *book_id* in **ratings.csv** and **to_read.csv** maps to *work_id*, not to *goodreads_book_id*. It means that ratings for different editions are aggregated.

## Download

[All files](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) are available on GitHub. Some of them are quite large, so GitHub won’t show their contents online. See [samples](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/tree/master/samples) for smaller CSV snippets. You can download individual zipped files from [releases](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/releases).

Thanks to Maciej Kula, the dataset is accessible from [Spotlight](https://maciejkula.github.io/spotlight/datasets/goodbooks.html), recommender software based on PyTorch.

## Citing

This is a preferred citation style:

```
@article{goodbooks2017,
 author = {Zajac, Zygmunt},
 title = {Goodbooks-10k: a new dataset for book recommendations},
 year = {2017},
 publisher = {FastML},
 journal = {FastML},
 howpublished = {\url{http://fastml.com/goodbooks-10k}},
}

```

The canonical name of the dataset is *goodbooks-10k*. *Goodbooks-10k* when starting the sentence, if you prefer.
