I am reading the image from url using PIL and converting it into a numpy array after converted grayscale image.

**Scipy** provides `dct` out of the box in the fftpack submodule, so one can implement 2-d dct by taking dct on the rows of the image, and then get the dct of the transposed image in the same way. I am using `nomr='ortho'` as this corresponds to **Type II** dct which is when people say dct, what they refer to. If you are familiar with Matlab, this optional parameter makes what you get when you use `dct(y)` in Matlab, too. (Note that there are eight different variants of dct and this one is the most common, I will not mention differences, but feel free to check it in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform).)

For `idct`, it is almost same with `dct`, with two i's are introduced into the function as fftpack provides very similar api for `idct` with `dct`, it becomes relatively straightforward.

In order to reconstruct the image, the image is clipped between 0 and 255 in order to have `uint8` to have an image that we begin with.
