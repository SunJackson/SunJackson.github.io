*Note: The video is the interview only. The audio podcast has the intro, interview, and data science learning club activity explanation.*

In Episode 3 of the Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast, we meet [Shlomo Argamon](https://science.iit.edu/people/faculty/shlomo-argamon), who is the founding director of the Master of Data Science program at Illinois Institute of Technology. He talks to us about his path to data science, including research in robotic vision and natural language processing, we discuss the traits of a good data science student, and he gives some advice for those of us learning data science.
