This is a pretty dumb post, in which I argue that functional programming has a lot of the bad parts of libertarianism and a lot of the good parts:

- Both ideologies strive to eliminate [the] state. *(ok, dumb dad joke)*

- Both ideologies are driven by a set of dogmatic axioms rather than a practical goal:

- Libertarianism wants to reduce the government because any involvement distorts free markets. I always struggled to see what the underlying objective function is (it doesnâ€™t seem to be maximization of peopleâ€™s utility). ðŸ¤”

- Functional programming wants to reduce side effects and make everything pure, often by enforcing onerous type systems. But why? Again I donâ€™t see an ultimate objective here. IMO it should start from the principle that the goal of a programming language should be to *make the programmers as productive as possible.* For instance, the little research that exists has shown that most bugs have little to [with typing](https://vimeo.com/74354480) and Iâ€™d expect something similar to apply to mutable state. In fact the largest class seems to be [poor error handling](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/10/06/simple-testing-can-prevent-most-critical-failures) *(ok, typing isnâ€™t necessarily related to FP, but in practice I find that strong typing and FP have highly overlapping fan clubs).*

- Both camps invoke obscure cases in history as a proof of success: libertarianists (more so anarchists I guess) often talks about Spain during the civil war, [Somalia](https://mises.org/library/stateless-somalia-and-loving-it), or sometimes Singapore. Haskell acolytes are very eager to bring up [Facebookâ€™s spam filtering](https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell).

- YET â€“ and this is the surprising part imho â€“ both ideologies are ~90% correct (source: my opinion). Which really surprises me given that they start from a (imo) arbitrary set of axioms.

- Even if you are a die hard bolshevik, you benefit from an understanding of how interventions distort markets, how incentives matter, and how entrepreneurship is the driver of progress.

- Even if you are coding in Visual Basic, you can level up your skills by learning FP: making functions pure when needed, avoid state, avoid reassign variables, avoid mutable data structures, write pipelines of data transformations, and all that jazz that FP has taught us to cherish.
