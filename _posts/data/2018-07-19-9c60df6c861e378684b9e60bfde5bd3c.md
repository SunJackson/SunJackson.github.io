*This work is supported by [Anaconda Inc.](http://anaconda.com/.)*

I’m pleased to announce the release of Dask version 0.18.0. This is a major
release with breaking changes and new features.
The last release was 0.17.5 on May 4th.
This blogpost outlines notable changes since the last release blogpost for
0.17.2 on March 21st.

You can conda install Dask:

or pip install from PyPI:

```
pip install dask[complete] --upgrade

```

Full changelogs are available here:

We list some breaking changes below, followed up by changes that are less
important, but still fun.

## Context

The Dask core library is nearing a 1.0 release.
Before that happens, we need to do some housecleaning.
This release starts that process,
replaces some existing interfaces,
and builds up some needed infrastructure.
Almost all of the changes in this release include clean deprecation warnings,
but future releases will remove the old functionality, so now would be a good
time to check in.

As happens with any release that starts breaking things,
many other smaller breaks get added on as well.
I’m personally very happy with this release because many aspects of using Dask
now feel a lot cleaner, however heavy users of Dask will likely experience
mild friction. Hopefully this post helps explain some of the larger changes.

## Notable Breaking changes

### Centralized configuration

Taking full advantage of Dask sometimes requires user configuration, especially
in a distributed setting. This might be to control logging verbosity, specify
cluster configuration, provide credentials for security, or any of several
other options that arise in production.

We’ve found that different computing cultures like to specify configuration in
several different ways:

1. Configuration files

1. Environment variables

1. Directly within Python code


Previously this was handled with a variety of different solutions among the
different dask subprojects. The dask-distributed project had one system,
dask-kubernetes had another, and so on.

Now we centralize configuration in the `dask.config` module, which collects
configuration from config files, environment variables, and runtime code, and
makes it centrally available to all Dask subprojects. A number of Dask
subprojects (dask.distributed,
[dask-kubernetes](http://dask-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest), and
[dask-jobqueue](http://dask-jobqueue.readthedocs.io/en/latest)), are being
co-released at the same time to take advantage of this.

If you were actively using Dask.distributed’s configuration files some things
have changed:


The configuration is now namespaced and more heavily nested. Here is an
example from the dask.distributed default config
file
today:
distributed:
 version: 2
 scheduler:
 allowed-failures: 3 # number of retries before a task is considered bad
 work-stealing: True # workers should steal tasks from each other
 worker-ttl: null # like '60s'. Workers must heartbeat faster than this

 worker:
 multiprocessing-method: forkserver
 use-file-locking: True
 


The default configuration location has moved from `~/.dask/config.yaml` to
`~/.config/dask/distributed.yaml`, where it will live along side several
other files like `kubernetes.yaml`, `jobqueue.yaml`, and so on.


However, your old configuration files will still be found and their values
will be used appropriately. We don’t make any attempt to migrate your old
config values to the new location though. You may want to delete the
auto-generated `~/.dask/config.yaml` file at some point, if you felt like being
particularly clean.

You can learn more about Dask’s configuration in Dask’s configuration
documentation

### Replaced the common get= keyword with scheduler=

Dask can execute code with a variety of scheduler backends based on threads,
processes, single-threaded execution, or distributed clusters.

Previously, users selected between these backends using the somewhat
generically named `get=` keyword:

```
x.compute(get=dask.threaded.get)
x.compute(get=dask.multiprocessing.get)
x.compute(get=dask.local.get_sync)

```

We’ve replaced this with a newer, and hopefully more clear, `scheduler=` keyword:

```
x.compute(scheduler='threads')
x.compute(scheduler='processes')
x.compute(scheduler='single-threaded')

```

The `get=` keyword has been deprecated and will raise a warning. It will be
removed entirely on the next major release.

For more information, see [documentation on selecting different schedulers](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/scheduling.html).

### Replaced dask.set_options with dask.config.set

Related to the configuration changes, we now include runtime state in the
configuration. Previously people used to set runtime state with the
`dask.set_options` context manager. Now we recommend using `dask.config.set`:

```
with dask.set_options(scheduler='threads'): # Before
 ...

with dask.config.set(scheduler='threads'): # After
 ...

```

The `dask.set_options` function is now an alias to `dask.config.set`.

### Removed the dask.array.learn subpackage

This was unadvertised and saw very little use. All functionality (and much
more) is now available in [Dask-ML](http://dask-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

### Other

We’ve removed the `token=` keyword from map_blocks and moved the
functionality to the `name=` keyword.
The `dask.distributed.worker_client` automatically rejoins the threadpool when
you close the context manager.
The Dask.distributed protocol now interprets msgpack arrays as tuples
rather than lists.

## Fun new features

### Arrays

#### Generalized Universal Functions

Dask.array now supports Numpy-style
[Generalized Universal Functions (gufuncs)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/c-api.generalized-ufuncs.html)
transparently.
This means that you can apply normal Numpy GUFuncs, like `eig` in the example
below, directly onto a Dask arrays:

```
import dask.array as da
import numpy as np

# Apply a Numpy GUFunc, eig, directly onto a Dask array
x = da.random.normal(size=(10, 10, 10), chunks=(2, 10, 10))
w, v = np.linalg._umath_linalg.eig(x, output_dtypes=(float, float))
# w and v are dask arrays with eig applied along the latter two axes

```

Numpy has gufuncs of many of its internal functions, but they haven’t
yet decided to switch these out to the public API.
Additionally we can define GUFuncs with other projects, like Numba:

```
import numba

@numba.vectorize([float64(float64, float64)])
def f(x, y):
 return x + y

z = f(x, y) # if x and y are dask arrays, then z will be too

```

What I like about this is that Dask and Numba developers didn’t coordinate
at all on this feature, it’s just that they both support the Numpy GUFunc
protocol, so you get interactions like this for free.

For more information see [Dask’s GUFunc documentation](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-gufunc.html). This work was done by [Markus Gonser (@magonser)](https://github.com/magonser).

#### New “auto” value for rechunking

Dask arrays now accept a value, “auto”, wherever a chunk value would previously
be accepted. This asks Dask to rechunk those dimensions to achieve a good
default chunk size.

```
x = x.rechunk({
 0: x.shape[0], # single chunk in this dimension
 # 1: 100e6 / x.dtype.itemsize / x.shape[0], # before we had to calculate manually
 1: 'auto' # Now we allow this dimension to respond to get ideal chunk size
})

# or
x = da.from_array(img, chunks='auto')

```

This also checks the `array.chunk-size` config value for optimal chunk sizes

```
>>> dask.config.get('array.chunk-size')
'128MiB'

```

To be clear, this doesn’t support “automatic chunking”, which is a very hard
problem in general. Users still need to be aware of their computations and how
they want to chunk, this just makes it marginally easier to make good
decisions.

#### Algorithmic improvements

Dask.array gained a full [einsum](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.einsum) implementation thanks to [Simon Perkins](https://github.com/sjperkins).

Also, Dask.array’s QR decompositions has become nicer in two ways:

1. They support [short-and-fat arrays](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.linalg.sfqr)


The [tall-and-skinny](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.linalg.tsqr)
variant now operates more robustly in less memory. Here is a friendly GIF
of execution:

This work is greatly appreciated and was done by [Jeremy Chan](https://github.com/convexset).

Native support for the [Zarr format](http://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable) for
chunked n-dimensional arrays landed thanks to Martin
Durant and John A
Kirkham. Zarr has been especially useful due to
its speed, simple spec, support of the full NetCDF style conventions, and
amenability to cloud storage.

### Dataframes and Pandas 0.23

As usual, Dask Dataframes had many small improvements. Of note is continued
compatibility with the just-released Pandas 0.23, and some new data ingestion
formats.

Dask.dataframe is consistent with changes in the recent Pandas 0.23 release
thanks to [Tom Augspurger](https://github.com/TomAugspurger).

#### Orc support

Dask.dataframe has grown a reader for the [Apache ORC](https://orc.apache.org/) format.

Orc is a format for tabular data storage that is common in the Hadoop ecosystem.
The new
[dd.read_orc](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/dataframe-api.html#dask.dataframe.read_hdf)
function parallelizes around similarly new ORC functionality within PyArrow .
Thanks to [Jim Crist](https://github.com/jcrist) for the work on the Arrow side
and [Martin Durant](https://github.com/martindurant) for parallelizing it with
Dask.

#### Read_json support

Dask.dataframe now has also grown a reader for JSON files.

The [dd.read_json](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/dataframe-api.html#dask.dataframe.read_json)
function matches most of the `pandas.read_json` API.

This came about shortly after a recent PyCon 2018 talk comparing Spark and
Dask dataframe where Irina
Truong mentioned that it was missing. Thanks to
[Martin Durant](https://github.com/martindurant) and Irina
Truong for this contribution.

See the [dataframe data ingestion documentation](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/dataframe-create.html)
for more information about JSON, ORC, or any of the other formats
supported by Dask.dataframe.

### Joblib

The [Joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib) library for parallel computing within
Scikit-Learn has had a [Dask backend](http://dask-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/joblib.html)
for a while now. While it has always been pretty easy to use, it’s now
becoming much easier to use well without much expertise. After using this in
practice for a while together with the Scikit-Learn developers, we’ve
identified and smoothed over a number of usability issues. These changes will
only be fully available after the next Scikit-Learn release (hopefully soon) at
which point we’ll probably release a new blogpost dedicated to the topic.

## Related projects

This release is timed with the following packages:

1. dask

1. distributed

1. dask-kubernetes


There is also a new repository for deploying applications on YARN (a job
scheduler common in Hadoop environments) called
[skein](https://jcrist.github.io/skein). Early adopters welcome.
