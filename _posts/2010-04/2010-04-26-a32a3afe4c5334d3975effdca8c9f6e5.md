 Ah, spring. A time of growth, renewal, love... and conferences.
Just one week after attending
the NSF
Design Workshop, I attended the first
annual Science
of Team Science conference at Northwestern University. The goal
of the conference series is to bring together scientists, researchers,
and practitioners that want to know how scientific teams work and how
to assemble scientific teams more
effectively. 

 
Interestingly, one of the highlights among a slew of fascinating talks
on successful scientific teams was a talk by
by Howard
Gadlin on teams that *don't* work well together. Gadlin is
a mediator and conflict resolution expert, thus he primarily works
with “broken” teams. One of his primary points was, to
recycle his clever tweak to the opening line of Anna Karenina,
“all unsuccessful teams are alike; each successful team is
successful in its own way.” If that is true, as Gadlin
convincingly argued, it poses a challenge to data scientists that are
trying to identify statistical signatures of successful teams.
Perhaps it would be more useful to study unsuccessful teams and try to
discern what *not* to do. 

 Also of note was a
discussion during a panel of how the insight that was developed by
many of the speakers would apply to teams in non-scientific contexts.
Although the scope of the conference was limited to scientific teams,
Gadlin noted that the same principles are likely to apply to other
types of teams, as “scientists are very much like
people.”
