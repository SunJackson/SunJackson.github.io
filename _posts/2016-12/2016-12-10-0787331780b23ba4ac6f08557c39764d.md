The biggest AI conference of the year has just ended:
[NIPS](http://nips.cc/) in Barcelona broke all records this year and the
program was exciting as always. It certainly remains my favorite conference
to attend.

One of the best things about NIPS are the numerous high-quality workshops;
this year [David Lopez-Paz](http://lopezpaz.org/),
[Alex Radford](https://twitter.com/alecrad), and
[LÃ©on Bottou](http://leon.bottou.org/) put together a workshop on
[Adversarial Training](https://sites.google.com/site/nips2016adversarial),
with most of the content related to *generative adversarial networks* (GAN).

If you have not heard of GANs before, Ian
Goodfellow gave a detailed tutorial on
GANs, slides
here, earlier in the
week and certainly GANs were the hot topic of this years NIPS.

I gave an invited talk at the GAN workshop on the NIPS 2016 paper on
[f-GAN](http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/papers/nowozin2016fgan.pdf), authored
by [Ryota Tomioka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ryoto),
Botond Cseke, and myself.

Here is the slide deck I used during the talk.


Please let me know your feedback.
