Below are two puzzles you might want to try asking your family and friends over the holidays. Try them out yourself, however, first.
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/december32016/think.png)|Both questions are simple questions, and both look as though they have obvious answers. Both are questions that, if you think too quickly and go with your gut, you’ll probably get incorrect the first time. Then, if you take a step back, and actually think about them and do the math, you should be able to get the correct answer without too much trouble.Neither of these questions are trick questions. Neither should leave a sour taste in the mouth when the answer is revealed. For both questions, I’ll reveal the answer in stages. After reading the question, give your first answer, then, click on the progressive buttons to reveal the correct answer, and finally the solution and explanation.|

Alice and Bob go into their local donut shop. Alice buys five donuts, and Bob buys three. As they are leaving, they meet Charlie and decide to cut-up, and share, all eight donuts equally between the three of them. After the feast, Charlie reaches into his pocket and discovers he has $0.80 in coins. Even though he knows that this amount of money is less than his share of the donuts eaten, he wants to compensate, as fairly as possible, Alice and Bob.

**Question:** How much of the money should he give Alice, and how much should he give Bob?

*(All the donuts are same price, everyone eats the same amount, and ‘fair’ means repayment of Alice and Bob equal percentages of their own individual outlays).*
