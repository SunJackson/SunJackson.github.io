In a previous post, I discussed how to [remove â€œPowered By WordPressâ€�](http://randyzwitch.com/removing-powered-by-wordpress-scrappy) from the footer of the Scrappy theme. You might also want to add a â€œBack to Topâ€� link in the footer, especially if your blog has a lot of vertical distance from the top to the bottom. Hereâ€™s how to do itâ€¦

The first step in creating our â€˜Back to Topâ€™ link is to modify the *header.php* file in our [WordPress child theme](http://randyzwitch.com/twenty-eleven-child-theme-creating-css-file) by adding an [empty HTML link](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) using the `<a>` tag. Although you can place an â€œanchorâ€� like this anywhere you want on your site, weâ€™ll add this empty link to the very top of the page for this tutorial.

Find the line of code in your `header.php` file that says ``. Here weâ€™ll add our extra line of code with the tag (line 5 of the code snippet):

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
|</head>

<body <?php body_class(); ?>>

<a name= "TopOfPage"/a>
 <?php do_action( 'before' ); ?>
 
 <header id="masthead" class="site-header" role="banner">

```

Normally when using an `'<a>'` tag, we would also use an `href` in order to create a link. However, in this case weâ€™re just defining an empty element in the page that we can refer to later using our â€˜Back to Topâ€™ link.

With our anchor in place, we can now add our link. For this tutorial, weâ€™re going to place the link right above the widget area in the Scrappy footer.

Opening up our `footer.php` file, we need to look for the code ``. Underneath this line, weâ€™ll add another `<a>` tag, but this time, weâ€™ll add an `href` tag in order to have a link to send the page back to the top (line 5 of the code snippet):

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
| <!-- #main -->
 <!-- .wrapper -->
 <footer id="colophon" class="site-footer" role="contentinfo">
 
 <a href=#TopOfPage> Your Text Goes Here </a>
 <?php get_sidebar( 'footer1' );
 get_sidebar( 'footer2' );
 get_sidebar( 'footer3' ); ?>
  
 

```

Notice that the link we have here uses the same â€œTopOfPageâ€� reference as we did in Step 1, this time with a # sign in front of the word. This lets the page code that we want to point to the â€œTopOfPageâ€� anchor elsewhere on site. Note also that we donâ€™t need to make any domain-specific references like we would do with a â€œnormalâ€� http://www.-type of link.

Obviously, feel free to change the reference to â€œYour Text Goes Hereâ€� to be whatever message youâ€™d like the link to say ğŸ™‚

Once you are done with these two changes, the bottom of your Scrappy WordPress theme should look similar to this:

'Back to Top' link added to the bottom of the Scrappy WordPress theme


The styling of the link should be right-aligned to your main article width and the link styling will be handled automatically based on the rules set in your CSS file.
