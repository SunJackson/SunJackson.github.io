I just got back from [PydataDC](http://pydata.org/dc2016), where I learned a lot, had fun, and met a bunch of awesome people! I’ll definitely write about it more later, but I wanted to share my slides here since I told the attendees they could find them on my website. I got good feedback on the talk, and I’m so glad that my message resonated with some people!

The talk was recorded and video should be out within a few weeks!

Here are the slides: [Becoming a Data Scientist – Advice from my Podcast Guests](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Becoming-a-Data-Scientist-Advice-PyDataDC-shared.pdf)and the [slide notes](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Becoming-a-Data-Scientist-Advice-PyDataDC-notes.pdf).

Update 10/26: Here is the recording of my talk, with a playlist of other talks from PyData DC!
