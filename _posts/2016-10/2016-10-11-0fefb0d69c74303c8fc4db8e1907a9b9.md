I just got back from PydataDC, where I learned a lot, had fun, and met a bunch of awesome people! I’ll definitely write about it more later, but I wanted to share my slides here since I told the attendees they could find them on my website. I got good feedback on the talk, and I’m so glad that my message resonated with some people!

The talk was recorded and video should be out within a few weeks!

Here are the slides: Becoming a Data Scientist – Advice from my Podcast Guestsand the slide notes.

Update 10/26: Here is the recording of my talk, with a playlist of other talks from PyData DC!
