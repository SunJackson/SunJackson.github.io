[Ian Ozsvald's](http://ianozsvald.com/) talk on [Cleaning Confused Collections of Characters](http://ianozsvald.com/2015/04/03/pydataparis-2015-and-cleaning-confused-collections-of-characters). Ian gave a very practical talk, full of real world examples. The slides have already been uploaded on [his website](http://ianozsvald.com/2015/04/03/pydataparis-2015-and-cleaning-confused-collections-of-characters). Many tips and many pointers to libraries. In particular, I discovered [fixes text for you](http://ftfy.readthedocs.org/.).

[Chloe-Agathe](http://cazencott.info/) gave a short talk on [DREAM challenges](http://dreamchallenges.org/). In her talk she mentioned [GPy](http://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy). One year ago, I visited [Neil Lawrence](http://inverseprobability.com/) at his lab in Sheffield and at that point they were in the process of migrating their Matlab codebase into Python (the GPy project). I'm very glad to see that the project is succeeding and being used by other research institutions.

[Serge Guelton](http://serge.liyun.free.fr/serge) and Pierrick Brunet presented “[Pythran](http://pythonhosted.org/pythran): Static Compilation of Parallel Scientific Kernels”. From their own documentation: “Pythran is a python to c++ compiler for a subset of the python language. It takes a python module annotated with a few interface description and turns it into a native python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster”. The project seems promising although I do not have had experience as to judge the quality of their implementation.

Antoine Pitrou presented: “[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), a JIT compiler for fast numerical code”. I must say that I'm an avid user of Numba so of course I was looking forward to this talk. One thing I didn't know is that support for CUDA is being implemented into Numba via the `@cuda.jit` decorator. From [their website](http://docs.continuum.io/numbapro) it looks like this is only available in the Numba Pro version (not free).

Kirill Smelkov presented [wendelin.core](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wendelin.core), an approach to perform out-of-core computations with numpy. Slides can be found [here](http://www.wendelin.io/NXD-Wendelin.Core.Non.Secret?format=pdf).

Finally, [Frances Alted](https://twitter.com/francescalted) gave the final keynote on “New Trends In Storing And Analyzing Large Data Silos With Python”. Among the projects he mentioned, I found particularly interesting [bcolz](http://bcolz.blosc.org/), his current main project and [DyND](https://github.com/aterrel/dynd-python), a Python wrapper around a multi-dimensional array library.
