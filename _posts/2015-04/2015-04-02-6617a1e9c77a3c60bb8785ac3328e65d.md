For the second year in a row, Divvy recently put out a challenge to scientists, designers, students, civic minds, planners, and programmers to analyze and present a year’s worth of ride data in visually compelling ways.
They opened up their data for the 2.45 million rides that occurred in 2014. As an avid Divvy rider, I was very excited to take a look at the data and participate in the challenge.


### 
Divvy & Chicago Weather



Even though I prefer to commute via Divvy over public transportation, I only use Divvy regularly from April to November because I can't handle Chicago’s cold—and long—winter. Since weather is the deciding factor as to whether or not I use Divvy, for the Divvy Data Challenge I wanted to find out how many other people felt the same way. Some of the questions I wanted to answer were:

- “How much does weather affect Divvy rides?”
- “Do trips change on cold days?”
- “Are there really people riding on Chicago’s most unbearably cold days?”

To do this I created an [interactive dashboard](http://gitlaura.github.io/divvyweather) that allows viewers to see how Chicago’s weather affected Divvy rides in 2014. I chose to compare number of rides, average time per ride, and average distance per ride to the average temperature over the course of the year. I also created a bar chart to compare ride count on the coldest and hottest days of 2014. The viewer can filter all charts by customer type or gender. Here are some of the insights I discovered.

- **Temperature and ride count curves have very similar shapes.**
