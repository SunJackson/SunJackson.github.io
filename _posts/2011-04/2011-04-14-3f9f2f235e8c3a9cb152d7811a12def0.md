The following algorithm computes the Least squares solution || Ax -
b|| subject to the equality constrain Bx = d. It's a classic algorithm
that can be implemented only using a QR decomposition and a least
squares solver. This implementation uses numpy and scipy. It makes use
of the new linalg.solve_triangular function in scipy 0.9, although
degrades to linalg.solve on older versions.

Update: now scipy has a function qr_multiply which would
considerably speed up this code
