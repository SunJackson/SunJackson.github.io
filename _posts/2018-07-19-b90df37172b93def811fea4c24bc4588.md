(This is not a very relevant/useful post for regular readers – feel free to skip. I thought I would share it so people can find it on Google.)

My blog blew up twice in a week earlier this year when I landed on Hacker News. The first time I was asleep so I didn’t notice that the site went down. The second time I did notice, and scrambled to reconfigure Apache & MySQL to handle the load.

I decided it was time to move off Wordpress.

This is something I had been thinking for a long time – I hated the layout with my old site, especially the typography. I probably could have spent a bunch of time tweaking it but it also feels philosophically wrong to run a LAMP stack in 2016 for something as simple as a blog.

After some research I chose Jekyll. I liked the idea of static content and it seemed very lightweight. To do this I had to

1. Clone [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole)

1. Install the [Wordpress to Jekyll exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter)

1. Run this [simple postprocessing script](https://gist.github.com/erikbern/5e81bf7d68e9deab9c55) I had to build for some cleanup

1. Fixup a couple of things with Poole (in particular add `height: auto;` to the `img` tag in `_sass/_base.scss`, everything else was cosmetic superficial stuff, mostly to get nice serif fonts that seems to be the shit recently).


Additionally I reconfigured some stuff around related pages (`brew install gsl`, `gem install rb-gsl`, set `lsi: true` in `_config.yml`). LSI is a pretty crappy algorithm for NLP but unfortunately there’s nothing better out there.

Since the entire state is stored in the file system, I also use Github to host a repo with the blog in it. I’m still hosting the blog on a Digitalocean droplet, but might kill it and just switch to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at some point.

Page load time went down drastically after deploying it:

This was all good until and I was running happily on my new blog until I was checking [Feedly](https://feedly.com/.). First it claimed that I was no longer subscribed to my own blog, then when I added it, my number of subscribers had dropped from 300 to 9. WTF! I realized it’s because my previous RSS was broken. I ended up setting up some 301 redirects using Apache. First of all, in `/feed/.htaccess`

```
RedirectMatch 301 /feed/(.*) http://erikbern.com/atom.xml

```

This will redirect `/feed/` to `atom.xml`. Then I moved `index.php` to `wordpress.php` and set this up in `/.htaccess`:

```
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} feed=
RewriteRule (.*) /atom.xml? [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/$
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} p=
RewriteRule (.*) /wordpress.php [R=301,L]

```

The first pattern will redirect `/?feed=xyz` to `atom.xml`. The last one is for old links to my blog – it will do a double 301, from `/?p=841` to `/wordpress.php?p=841` to `/2014/11/29/deep-learning-for-chess/`.

I’m now up to 230 readers on Feedly – not sure wtf is going on but seems better than 9. Please resubscribe if you lost it!
