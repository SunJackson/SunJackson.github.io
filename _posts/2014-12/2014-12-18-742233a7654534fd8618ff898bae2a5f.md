Last week, 
we wrote about the accuracy of ESPN’s fantasy football
projections and found that, well, they’re not perfect.
Fortunately, ESPN isn’t the only prognosticator in town. [FantasyPros](http://www.fantasypros.com/) serves as an aggregator of
all things fantasy football and even provides the weekly projections of seven
different sources.[[1]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections#ftnt1)

With championships starting this week, it seemed like a good idea to
compare the accuracy of these seven sources in order to determine which is
best to trust before setting your lineup.

We’ll be using the same methodology as before and will only look at
fantasy relevant players,[[2]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections#ftnt2) which this time are specific to each expert. For
instance, if ESPN says Shaun Hill is the 20th best QB this week, and
numberFire says he’s 21st, he will be included in that week’s data
for ESPN, but not numberFire.

Note that FantasyPros does not include projections for defenses, so we
won’t be looking at them in this analysis.

### ESPN

##### 95% Confidence Interval: 1.3 +/- 0.25

Since we already looked at ESPN’s accuracy last week, this chart is
mainly a refresher that ESPN over-projects. The first chart shows the actual
distribution of errors; that is, the projected score minus
actual score for each observation.[[3]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections#ftnt3) The second is the
standard error of the
mean for the distribution. Because zero doesn’t fall within the
95% confidence interval, we’re able to say that ESPN’s projections
are, on average, biased.

### Pro Football Focus

##### 95% Confidence Interval: 0.21 +/- 0.24

Pro Football
Focus looks a little bit different than ESPN. There’s a much
larger mass near zero in the first chart. This means that the observed
errors are frequently only a couple points off. Looking at the standard error
of the mean, it becomes clear that Pro Football Focus’ projections are
much better than ESPN’s. So much so that our 95% confidence interval
contains zero, meaning Pro Football Focus’ projections are, on average,
indistinguishable from zero - we cannot say they are biased.

### Dave Richard, CBS Sports

##### 95% Confidence Interval: 1.08 +/- 0.24

Dave
Richard (CBS Sports) has error distributions closely resembling those
of ESPN. Not much to say here - Dave tends to over-project as well, but not as
much as ESPN.

### Bloomberg Sports

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections/image01.png)


##### 95% Confidence Interval: 0.34 +/- 0.23

Oh so close! Bloomberg
Sports just misses having projection errors that are
indistinguishable from zero. While we can say their projections are biased (on
average), they aren’t biased by much.

### FFToday

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections/image07.png)


##### 95% Confidence Interval: 1.06 +/- 0.26

[FFToday](http://www.fftoday.com/) looks similar to ESPN
and Dave Richard. They also over-project.

### Jamey Eisenberg, CBS Sports

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections/image05.png)


##### 95% Confidence Interval: 1.74 +/- 0.25

Jamey
Eisenberg (CBS Sports) does the worst of the seven sources available
on FantasyPros. Both he and his colleague Dave Richard over-project on
average.

### numberFire

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections/image00.png)


##### 95% Confidence Interval: 0.15 +/- 0.23

[numberFire](http://www.numberfire.com/) looks very similar
to Pro Football Focus; pretty damn good - another site whose projections we
cannot say are biased.

### Are some sites better at certain positions?

More interesting than just straight comparison is determining the strengths
and weaknesses of each site.

Below, we use small
multiples of histograms to compare all experts by position (except
D/ST, which isn’t available on FantasyPros). Each of our seven experts
is a row, while each position is a column (and color). All charts are on the
same scale and centered at zero, allowing you to quickly scan through and spot
changes.

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections/image06.png)


By scanning on a row by row basis, it’s clear the distributions move
around. There are two possible explanations for this: 1) Each expert struggles
to project consistently across positions or 2) Each expert is actually being
bit by the same unanticipated player performances. Scanning on a column basis,
you’ll notice that the shifts follow a similar pattern in each column,
giving us more evidence to suggest that some player performances are simply
unpredictable.

Surprisingly, while some experts might be biased overall, they’re
still strong at certain positions. For instance, look at Dave Richard’s
chart for RBs - almost perfectly centered (which is really good). Additionally,
while Pro Football Focus is unbiased overall, they excel at predicting QBs
compared to our other sources.

One takeaway from all of this is that the pay sites (Pro Football Focus,
numberFire, and Bloomberg Sports) are actually better than the free ones,
especially within individual positions. I didn’t expect there to be such
a clear difference.

Another is that accurate predictions are hard to make.

*Update: *[numberFire's weekly projections](http://www.numberfire.com/nfl/fantasy/fantasy-football-projections) are actually within the free section of their site.

Sports, FFToday, and Pro Football Focus

[[2]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/which-site-has-the-best-fantasy-football-projections#ftnt_ref2) We defined
“fantasy relevant” as each week’s top 20 projected QBs, 60
RBs, 60 WRs, 20 TEs, 15 Ks, and 15 D/ST. Assuming a 10 team, standard roster
league, we felt these were the players that really mattered for
projections.

Each observation is a game for a player.
