“ESPN’s fantasy football projections are way off. They're
projecting Kelvin Benjamin will score 18.4 points in my league. He's only scored
over 18 points twice, and one of those times was 18.2 points. He averages 13
points a game. How do they come up with this stuff?!“


That was something I casually said at work one day before week 9.

At Datascope, these kind of statements (and [others](https://twitter.com/gjreda/status/538864180183703552)) spark
fierce debate and quickly escalate into bets. As soon as the words left my
mouth, [Dean](https://datascopeanalytics.com/who-we-are/dean-malmgren) was
there, right hand extended; a six-pack bet was on the table.

Dean believed that ESPN's projections are, on average, [accurate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) —
that the difference between ESPN's projected scores and actual scores is not
significantly different than zero. I didn’t have a strong enough opinion
to bet, but [Mike](https://datascopeanalytics.com/who-we-are/mike-stringer) couldn’t
pass up another opportunity to beat Dean, so he took it.

Given that fantasy football championships are near, it seemed like a fun
question to answer - **how accurate are ESPN’s weekly projections**?
Thankfully, ESPN has pages for their
historical
projections and 
weekly scoring. Mix in [a little code](https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/fantasy-football-projections), and
we're able to answer the question pretty easily.

Here’s what things look like through week 14:

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate/histogram-absolute-error-all-players.png)


Above is the distribution of absolute errors for all players ESPN projected
to score at least one point.[[1]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate#ftnt1) Negative values mean ESPN under-projected,
positive values mean they over-projected. Based on this, it looks like ESPN
might over-project slightly, but that distribution is pretty close to
being centered around zero. To determine whether the projections really are
biased, we need to test for statistical
significance.

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate/histogram-mean-absolute-error-all-players.png)


The chart above shows a bootstrapped estimate of the mean absolute error.
With [bootstrapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)),
we create many simulations of our observed data by randomly sampling from it
(with replacement). For each simulation, we take the mean of the absolute
errors. The resulting distribution (above) is the [standard error of the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error),
in this case giving us a 95% confidence
interval of 0.34 +/- 0.2. If zero were to fall within our 95%
confidence interval, we would say that ESPN’s projections are, on
average, indistinguishable from zero.

We probably don’t care about all projections though. In most
fantasy football leagues, only about 180 players are “owned” at a
given time. For the purposes of the bet, we really care about “fantasy
relevant” players; that is, players where the projection is relevant to
determining who you sit or start.[[2]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate#ftnt2)

The first chart shows the absolute error distribution for fantasy relevant
players, while the second shows the standard error of the mean for that
distribution (again using bootstrapping). We can see that the standard error of
the mean shifts further to the right, this time with a 95% confidence interval
of 1.40 +/- 0.25.

Whether we look at all players or only fantasy relevant players
doesn’t change the results. On average, ESPN over-projects.[[3]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate#ftnt3)

That settles the bet — ESPN over-projects fantasy football points. Mike wins. Sorry, Dean.

The end? [Nope.](http://media.giphy.com/media/mk1amfgVbA7gk/giphy.gif)

While the bet’s officially over, we’ve only looked at the
absolute error — the difference between projected points and actual
points scored. One issue with this approach is that it doesn’t take the
underlying projection into account.

For instance, imagine Matt
Forte was projected to score 20 points while Ka’Deem
Carey (Forte’s backup) was projected to score one point. If
Forte scores 19 points and Carey scores zero, both players have an absolute
error of one point. However, one could argue that the near-miss on
Forte’s total is more impressive.

An alternative approach would be to look at the relative error, which
normalizes the absolute error against the prediction.[[4]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate#ftnt4) Using the previous example,
Forte’s relative error is 5% while Carey’s relative error is
100%.

Here’s what things look like if we look at the relative error for
fantasy relevant players.

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate/histogram-mean-relative-error-ffb-relevant-small.png)


That changes things completely! The first chart shows the
distribution of the relative error, while the second shows the standard error of
the mean for the relative error. This time, our mean relative error distribution
heavily overlaps zero, meaning that ESPN’s projections are accurate.
[Dean wins!](http://media.giphy.com/media/uEB2LsVH56bZe/giphy.gif)

Wait, what happened?

![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate/histogram-median-relative-error-ffb-relevant-smaller.png)


Above we’ve added a bootstrapped estimate of the *median*
relative error.

Looking at all three, the story becomes clear. In the first chart, we see
that the relative error distribution is nearly centered around zero; however,
while there’s more mass on the positive side, there are some large
negative values. When we look at the standard error of the mean (center), the
larger negative values cancel out the mass of small positive values, creating
a nice distribution around zero. Nonetheless, in the last chart, we see
the standard error of the median is consistently 0.25 or higher, **meaning that half the time, ESPN over-projects by at least 25%.**

Which brings us to an important question: how do we define bias? Well, it
depends on what we want. In this case, the average relative error of
ESPN’s projections is indistinguishable from zero, but **ESPN over-projects 60% of the time**!

This shows the importance of knowing the underlying distribution of your
data. Since fantasy scoring is not normally distributed, one could argue that
the mean should not be used due to the [long tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) of the
distribution making the mean a poor measure of the center. Depending on your
use-case, the median might be better suited.

[[2]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate#ftnt_ref2) We defined
“fantasy relevant” as each week’s top 20 projected QBs, 60
RBs, 60 WRs, 20 TEs, 15 Ks, and 15 D/ST. Assuming a 10 team, standard roster
league, we felt these were the players that really mattered for
projections.

[[3]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-espns-fantasy-football-projections-accurate#ftnt_ref3) Stated
differently: Mike beat Dean. Again.
