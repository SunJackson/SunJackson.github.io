You're not as different from Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin after all, at least when it comes to patterns of correspondence. A new study of human behavior demonstrates that those who wrote letters using pen and paper -- long before electronic mail existed -- did so in a pattern similar to the way people use e-mail today. The study, entitled [On Universality in Human Correspondence Activity](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/325/5948/1696), was written by [Dean Malmgren](https://datascopeanalytics.com/who-we-are), [Andriana Campanharo](http://amaral-lab.org/people/campanharo), [Daniel Stouffer](http://ieg.ebd.csic.es/DanielStouffer), and [Luis Amaral](http://amaral-lab.org/people/amaral). 

An example of how digital footprint data can yield important insights, the paper has also garnered attention from the press, with articles highlighting the work in [TIME](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1926080,00.html) and [US News and World Report](http://www.usnews.com/articles/science/2009/09/28/how-would-einstein-use-e-mail.html).
