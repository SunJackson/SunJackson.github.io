 My fantasy football team, Does Not Compute, scored a
respectable 74 points during week 1, thanks in large part to
Thomas Jones who scored twice as many points as Yahoo! projected.
Unfortunately my opponent, a long-time friend who has yet to rub
salt in my eyes, scored 83 points, leaving Does Not Compute with
the same record as my beloved Bears: 0-1. 

 The thing
that irritates me about the loss is
that Greg
Olsen, the tight end on both my fantasy and real teams, had
one reception for eight yards resulting in a grand total of ZERO
fantasy points. Should I trade him away? 


Naturally, I could not help but wonder whether this would be a
common occurance for Olsen or whether this was a fluke of a
performance as his
quarterback Jay
Cutler adjusts to a new offense. From Fig. 2 of
my previous
post, it was clear that all offensive positions frequently
do not score any fantasy points. It just so happens that tight
ends are the worst offenders (yuk yuk) and do not score any
fantasy points 59% of the time. 

 Let me repeat that:
59% of the time, tight ends score zero points. Do you carry an
umbrella if a weatherman says there is a 59% chance of rain? I do;
59% is a lot. 

 It is also misleading in this case.
Most active NFL players are held in reserve and rarely play a
single down. Those that do play can get injured and need to sit
out several consecutive games. Both of these effects therefore
introduce correlations in the frequency with which players score
zero fantasy points, consequently biasing the 59% average in a
non-trivial manner. 

 To better understand the
origins of the “zero effect”, I propose the following
simple Markov
model. In this model, a player either plays in a game or he
does not (in which case he can not score any fantasy points). We
then assume that a player plays in games during consecutive weeks
with probability *p* and with probability *q* a
player does not play in games during consecutive weeks. We can
then estimate these parameters *p* and *q* for each
player in the NFL to obtain a more detailed understanding of the
“zero effect” (Fig. 1).

 Fig. 1: Estimate of the probability of playing in consecutive weeks *p* and the probability of not playing in consecutive weeks *q* for each player, arranged by position. Black dots represent the actual parameter estimates. Greg Olsen is highlighted with a black cross. 

 Based on this description of players, three groups of players emerge: starters, who play in every game, are in the lower right-hand corner (*p*=1, *q*=0); bench warmers, who never play, are in the upper left-hand corner (*p*=0, *q*=1); and role players, who neither ride the bench nor start consistently. Interestingly, Olsen is a role player (*p*=0.83, *q*=0.29) and, because of his parameterization, we can see that there is almost a 30% chance that he will score zero points again next week. 

 While a 30% chance may be enough of a chance for some people to grab their umbrella, I think I will weather the storm and not trade away Olsen.
