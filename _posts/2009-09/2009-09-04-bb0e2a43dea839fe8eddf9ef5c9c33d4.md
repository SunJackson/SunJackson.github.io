 While I have always enjoyed watching collegiate football, I
have never followed professional football with much interest. My
typical excuse: some “purity” is lost when athletes
turn pro.


 Seriously? Waa waa waa
waaaaaaaa. Reflecting on this pathetic excuse, I am going
to do a few things differently this season.


 First, I
am not going to use the words “purity” and
“football” in the same sentence. Starting
now.


 Second, I am going to be
a [Bears](http://www.chicagobears.com/) fan. If you
don't like it, take it up
with Brian
Urlacher, a big man who will undoubtedly talk some sense into
you.


 Third, I am going to play fantasy football.
While this will be a great opportunity to learn more about the
various NFL teams and to shoot the breeze
about Drew
Brees (ugh, did I write that?), I am excited about fantasy
football for a different reason: analytics. Indeed, the entire
purpose of this series of blog posts is to publicize my attempts
to beat the snot out of my opponents with
analytics.


 Draft
prep


 So in preparation for my first fantasy
football draft, I did what any self-respecting statistician would
do; I obtained some *empirical* data. In particular, I
obtained the lifetime statistics for all offensive
players—quarterbacks (QBs), running backs (RBs), wide
receivers (WRs), tight ends (TEs), and kickers (Ks)—that
are playing in the NFL this season. For the purposes of this
post, I did not analyze fantasy defenses as this would have
required considerably more work.

Fig. 1:
Weighted distribution of fantasy points per game for Adrian
Peterson and Drew Brees. Since Drew Brees is more likely to
score more points than Adrian Peterson, I rank Drew Brees
higher.


 By combining these game-by-game
statistics for each player with the fantasy points allocated in
my Yahoo! Sports
Fantasy League (*i.e.* 6 fantasy points per touchdown,
1 fantasy point per 10 yards rushing, etc.), I can compute the
distribution of fantasy points for each player. This is somewhat
complicated by the fact that some players (er
hem, Bret
Favre) have been playing in the NFL for a long time. Since it
is unlikely that a player's performance 10+ years ago will bear
any resemblence to his performance this season, I compute the
distribution of fantasy points by using a linear weighting
function that places the most weight on games from last season
and no weight on any games from 4+ years ago. This weighted
distribution of fantasy points therefore places the most emphasis on
outcomes from recent seasons without completely neglecting past
performances.


 I use this weighted fantasy point
distribution for each player to determine which player is more
likely to score more fantasy points in a game. For example, I
rank Drew Brees higher than Adrian Peterson, because Drew Brees is
more likely to score more fantasy points in a game than Adrian
Peterson (Fig. 1). The results of my rankings compared with the
Yahoo! Sports and CBS Sportsline rankings are shown in
Tbl. 1.


Tbl. 1:
Comparison of my top 10 rankings with Yahoo! Sports' top 10
rankings.

|10.|TonyRomo (QB)|Drew Brees (QB)|LarryFitzgerald (WR)|

 This
analysis highlights a few interesting issues. First, I
systematically rank quarterbacks higher than running backs and
wide receivers whereas Yahoo! Sports and CBS Sportsline appear to
do the exact opposite (Tbl. 1). It is unclear to me why Yahoo!
Sports and CBS Sportsline rank running backs and wide receivers
higher than quarterbacks; quarterbacks clearly have a higher
average fantasy points than running backs and wide receivers
(Fig. 2). One possibility for this discrepency is that Yahoo!
Sports and CBS Sportsline use a much more sophisticated ranking
scheme than my minimalistic approach. For instance, they might
account for a team's schedule, the effect
of Terrell
Owens on his teammates, or the quality of a particular player
relative to other players of the same
position.

offensive position. A large portion of players at each position never score any fantasy points.


 Second, it is clear that the distribution of fantasy points does not place equal emphasis on each position (Fig.
2). Quarterbacks systematically have more fantasy points than nearly every other position. In comparison with
the other offensive players, tight ends are almost inconsequential additions to any fantasy team. It is
interesting to imagine changing the fantasy point allocation such that each position has the same expected
distribution of fantasy points. For example, tight ends should receive 1 fantasy point for every 3 yards
receiving to put them on par with wide receivers that receive 1 fantasy point for every 10 yards receiving.


 Draft day

 Feeling like a broker trading on insider information, I showed up to my first online draft with my precomputed
list of ranked players (Tbl. 1). I felt smuggly confident as I drafted all of my offensive players and populated
my bench with, dare I say, a superb B squad. When it came to defenses, there was really only one reasonable
choice I could make: Da
Bears. So now I enter the fantasy football season with my team (Tbl. 2), aptly named “Does not
compute”, on a quest to beat the snot out of my opponents.
