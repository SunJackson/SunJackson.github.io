Using OpenStreetMap data, Geoff Boeing [charted the orientation distributions of major cities](http://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/comparing-city-street-orientations):

> Each of the cities above is represented by a polar histogram (aka rose diagram) depicting how its streets orient. Each bar’s *direction* represents the compass bearings of the streets (in that histogram bin) and its *length* represents the relative frequency of streets with those bearings. 

So you can easily spot the gridded street networks, and then there’s Boston and Charlotte that are a bit nutty. Check out Boeing’s other chart for orientation of [major non-US cities](http://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/city-street-orientations-world).

See also Stephen Von Worley’s [color-coded maps](http://flowingdata.com/2014/10/16/road-grid-orientation-in-major-cities) and [Seth Kadish’s charts from 2014](http://flowingdata.com/2014/03/25/level-of-road-grid) that showed the same thing but used Census data instead of OpenStreetMap.
