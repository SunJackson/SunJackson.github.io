I recently met up with someone who does geospatial stuff but uses the more traditional GIS software to do it. I showed him a few things in R but not being a person who does a lot of geospatial analysis I thought I’d ask the lovely #rspatial crowd what they’d recommend. Here are the compiled recommendations. Happy learning spatial R!

Feel free to comment or tweet your recommendations to get them added to this list.

In no particular order, here are the folks who were recommended to follow on Twitter for R geospatial stuff.

I’ve added all of these into a Twitter list that you can use to read tweets from these wonderful people.
