I gave a talk last night at the Berlin machine learning meetup on learning graph embeddings in hyperbolic space, featuring [the recent NIPS 2017 paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations.pdf) of Nickel & Kiela. Covered are:

- An illustration of why the Euclidean plane is not a good place to embed trees (since circle circumference grows only linearly in the radius);

- Extending this same argument to higher dimensional Euclidean space;

- An introduction to the hyperbolic plane and the Poincaré disc model;

- A discussion of [Rik Sarkar’s result](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/papers/HyperbolicDelaunayFull.pdf) that trees embed with arbitrarily small error in the hyperbolic plane;

- A demonstration that, in the hyperbolic plane, circle circumference is exponential in the radius (better written [here](http://building-babylon.net/2018/04/10/circle-circumference-in-the-hyperbolic-plane-is-exponential-in-the-radius-a-proof-by-computer-game));

- A review of the results of Nickel & Kiela on the (transitive closure of the) WordNet hypernymy graph;

- Some thoughts on the gradient optimisation (perhaps better written [here](http://building-babylon.net/2018/04/10/gradient-optimisation-on-the-poincare-disc)).
