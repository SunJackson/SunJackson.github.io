[Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/), fundamentally, is a lightweight generator of task graphs for Python.
A task graph is a way of describing a sequence of operations so that they can be executed at a later point.
By building these task graphs, Dask describes the exact sequence of inputs, operations, and outputs that your algorithm requires, and can send this description to a variety of backends for efficient parallel and/or out-of-core computation.

Though the low-level details are interesting, it is the higher-level interfaces that most people will use.
These interfaces are:

- `dask.bag`: create task graphs using a functional programming style

- `dask.array`: create task graphs using a NumPy-like array interface

- `dask.dataframe`: create task graphs using a Pandas-like DataFrame interface


Each of these provides a familiar Python interface for operating on data, with the difference that individual operations build graphs rather than computing results; the results must be explicitly extracted with a call to the `compute()` method.
As an example of Dask in action, let's take a look at an example of using `dask.array`.
