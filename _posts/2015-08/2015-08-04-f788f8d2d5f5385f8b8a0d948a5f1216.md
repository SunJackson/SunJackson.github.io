Today we’re announcing the latest recipients of support from the [Knight Prototype Fund](http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-prototype-fund). Twenty-two projects will join scores of others who have taken ideas from concept to demo since we launched the fund in June 2012. 


Check out the full list below, which represents a range of ideas from government, the media, nonprofits, universities, libraries and more. The Prototype Fund serves as our primary tool for funding early-stage media and information projects. The model invites applicants to experiment, learn and iterate before moving on to the more costly stage of building out a project.


In addition to receiving $35,000 in funding, Prototype Fund projects go through a six-month process that begins with a three-day course in human-centered design, facilitated by [LUMA Institute](http://www.luma-institute.com/). Building on that training to better develop their projects, the teams gather six months later for a demo day to share their discoveries and developments.  They join an expanding network of innovators seeking to provide better ways to inform and engage communities with the information that is essential to their lives. Some of the projects may eventually receive additional funding from [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) to help them scale.


Every quarter we announce a new cohort and invite new applications. We’re looking for U.S.-based organizations with projects that explore media, journalism, civic experience, and data and information needs. To learn more and to apply, please visit [prototypefund.org](https://knight.submittable.com/submit).


Our open call for ideas closes Aug. 17. We look forward to seeing yours.


If you have specific questions about the application process, we will be [holding office hours](https://bluejeans.com/315727365/browser) Friday, Aug. 14 from noon - 1 p.m. ET. You can join online or by telephone (1-888-240-2560, Meeting ID: 315 727 365).
