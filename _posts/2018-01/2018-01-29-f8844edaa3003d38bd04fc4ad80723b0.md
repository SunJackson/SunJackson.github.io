If you have been following the first two posts (post 1, post 2), now is time to reap the rewards! I will show here how to obtain a ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-aa3282f165dce006d9f76f4336115856_l3.png?resize=73%2C18&ssl=1)
-competitive algorithm for (weighted) paging, i.e., when the metric space corresponds to the leafs of a weighted star. This was viewed as a breakthrough result 10 years ago (with a JACM publication by Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor in 2012), and for good reasons as this simplest instance of ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server was in fact the one studied in the seminal paper by Sleator and Tarjan in 1985 which introduced the competitive analysis of online algorithms (actually to be precise Sleator and Tarjan considered the unweighted case, for which a ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-aa3282f165dce006d9f76f4336115856_l3.png?resize=73%2C18&ssl=1)

State space for weighted ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)

 distance between two fractional ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)

Consider a fractional move from ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-12b4282abc952dbb7d26400bda625105_l3.png?resize=77%2C18&ssl=1)

, so that the Wasserstein-![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&ssl=1)

. Furthermore there is trivially a transport plan achieving that much total mass transfer. In other words we just proved that in this case the appropriate norm is a weighted ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6c18ad6e740737272d8ec5c3b11a1614_l3.png?resize=13%2C17&ssl=1)

One can think of ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6503c6edfb631ef7cf399558dd33fdf1_l3.png?resize=83%2C21&ssl=1)

 has a small Lipschitz norm). Thus we see that we have two key desiderata for the choice of the mirror map ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8581dbc45f448345dcc6bd9caed502e9_l3.png?resize=12%2C14&ssl=1)
: (i) it should have a small Lipschitz norm, (ii) one should be able to relate the movement cost ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-437774232cba7e04af48987fe2e6c685_l3.png?resize=283%2C20&ssl=1)

, say up to a multiplicative factor ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0210468bf4cb3a50550e30ce7951201b_l3.png?resize=11%2C8&ssl=1)
. One would then obtain a ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1def514bdee25296afee521c81107656_l3.png?resize=103%2C22&ssl=1)
-competitive algorithm.

Entropy regularization for weighted ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-paging

Let us look at (ii), and we shall see that the entropy regularization comes out very naturally. Ignore for a moment the Lagrange multiplier ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6eb8846c9752a5484de35c27bbfed01a_l3.png?resize=29%2C18&ssl=1)
 and let us search for a separable regularizer of the form ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f8f0b5504614e839b7b88909539584bf_l3.png?resize=132%2C19&ssl=1)
. We want to relate ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bf4b56163df5c3b09f212eefbb826a3f_l3.png?resize=37%2C18&ssl=1)
 to ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-44d2c8d38c21d4e619a3b0c0d6643e60_l3.png?resize=258%2C20&ssl=1)
. Making those two quantities equal gives ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9ecac30c41711b10733798f16a9ab659_l3.png?resize=152%2C18&ssl=1)
 and thus the regularizer is a *weighted negentropy*: ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8f25f00d5935e2852faf85844f3b5c87_l3.png?resize=165%2C19&ssl=1)

We now need to verify that this relation between the virtual service cost and the movement cost remains true even when the Lagrange mutilplier ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6eb8846c9752a5484de35c27bbfed01a_l3.png?resize=29%2C18&ssl=1)
 is taken into account. Note that because of the form of the state space ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&ssl=1)
 the multiplier contains a term of the form ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-22ded61b7c76365587ed7802acdf9ba2_l3.png?resize=152%2C18&ssl=1)
 (which corresponds to the constraint ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c083dfc8088c67ef93c116fe6f19be65_l3.png?resize=125%2C20&ssl=1)
) and for each location a term forcing the derivative to be ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-caf0da06544de11692c73aa19868e895_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)
 if the value of the missing mass has reached ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&ssl=1)
. In other words we obtain the following dynamics for mirror descent with the weighted negentropy regularization:

Notice that up to a factor ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bc2da46d9824359f6ac8d33c5fb882dd_l3.png?resize=8%2C12&ssl=1)
 one can focus on controlling ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-170d50c12c9b51c8cf472dd358cca3f7_l3.png?resize=74%2C19&ssl=1)
 (that is only movement *into* a location is charged). In that view the Lagrange multipliers simply have no effect, since one has ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-33b2a6e03f09ea62df6925a1b4fbcaf1_l3.png?resize=64%2C18&ssl=1)
 (indeed recall that ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6b22150bcf6c923074b9f5d4201ab5ac_l3.png?resize=113%2C20&ssl=1)
). Thus we see that the movement cost ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-170d50c12c9b51c8cf472dd358cca3f7_l3.png?resize=74%2C19&ssl=1)
 is exactly bounded by the virtual service cost ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bf4b56163df5c3b09f212eefbb826a3f_l3.png?resize=37%2C18&ssl=1)
 in this case.

 Lipschitz

It remains to deal with a non-trivial issue, namely the entropy is not Lipschitz on the simplex! A similar issue is faced in online learning when one tries to prove *tracking expert regret bounds*, i.e., bounds with respect to a shifting expert. The standard solution (perhaps first used by Herbster and Warmuth in 98, see also Blum and Burch 00) is to shift the variables so that they never get below some ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-91f305aed0390c4593ac91ef32898a37_l3.png?resize=41%2C12&ssl=1)
, in which case the Lipschitz constant would be ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7e38ad797a3b78dd203bf1b18964e94d_l3.png?resize=90%2C19&ssl=1)

 with total mass ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
. A natural way to “round down” is at each location to put ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-caf0da06544de11692c73aa19868e895_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)
 if the mass was ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7504a24db9c20680a192709d477885ff_l3.png?resize=25%2C15&ssl=1)

 should stay ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&ssl=1)
. This suggests the mapping ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1a289095b493195ded2e36064e802e89_l3.png?resize=164%2C21&ssl=1)
, which is ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d950d967e91067a07831916c993faa8c_l3.png?resize=24%2C23&ssl=1)
-Lipschitz. Thus the movement of ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d5de57590b548a86f190724658f443dc_l3.png?resize=53%2C18&ssl=1)
 is controlled by the movement of ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-746395c40249994569c4321ffdf51db3_l3.png?resize=28%2C18&ssl=1)
 up to a multiplicative factor ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d950d967e91067a07831916c993faa8c_l3.png?resize=24%2C23&ssl=1)
. Moreover one clearly has ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9ab7e4417c17e1283b47d55fec433e85_l3.png?resize=116%2C20&ssl=1)
 (in fact the inequality can be strict, in which case one should think of the “lost mass” as being stored at the root, this incurs no additional movement cost).
