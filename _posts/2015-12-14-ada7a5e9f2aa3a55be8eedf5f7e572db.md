Here is the first episode of the Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast, which is also available in video form!(sorry for the poor video quality!)

In this episode, I talk a little about the podcast, I talk about my own background, and I introduce the Data Science Learning Club. Enjoy!(Note: Episode 1, the first interview episode, comes out Monday 12/21!)
