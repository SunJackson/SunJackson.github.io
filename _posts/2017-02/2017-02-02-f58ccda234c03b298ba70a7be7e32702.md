Ever wondered how inverted music would sound like? Do you know what the original song is of this [inverted song](https://github.com/kevin91nl/remidi/raw/master/data/fools_garden_lemon_tree_inverted.mid) (and don’t look at the URL!)? In this post, some MIDI files are inverted and it is shown how you can invert a MIDI file yourself.



## Inverted Music

As inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IAZY7JdSHU), inverted music is defined as follows here. Suppose there is a basenote of value ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
. Any note of value ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
 will be changed in opposite direction, such that the inverted note has value ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V+%2B+%28X+-+V%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
. So, the function ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
 which inverts a note is defined as ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28X%29+%3A%3D+V+%2B+%28X+-+V%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
.

As an example, assume that D is the basenote. A C (which has a distance 2 to D [C C# D]) is converted to an E (a distance 2 in the opposite direction: [D D# E]). Something funny happens with chords. A major chords will become a minor chord once it is inverted. Check it out yourself by looking at ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28X%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
, ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28X%2B4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
 and ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28X%2B7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
.

## Programming

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kevin91nl/remidi). It just applies the rule above on all the MIDI tracks (except for the drum track).

```
 for track in mid.tracks:
 new_track = MidiTrack()
 if 'drum' in track.name.lower():
 new_track = track
 else:
 for message in track:
 if isinstance(message, MetaMessage):
 new_track.append(message)
 else:
 if 'note' in dir(message):
 inverted_note = basenote - (message.note - basenote)
 new_track.append(message.copy(note=inverted_note, time=int(message.time)))
 else:
 new_track.append(message)

 inverted.tracks.append(new_track)
```

Python is besides music also suitable for machine learning tasks. Maybe [this article on fraud detection](https://www.data-blogger.com/2017/06/15/fraud-detection-a-simple-machine-learning-approach) using machine learning algorithms is interesting for you. If not, you might be interested in a simple tutorial on building a [spam detection system](https://www.data-blogger.com/2016/01/20/spam-detection).

 

## Inverted MIDI files

Check out the original [Fools Garden – Lemon Tree](https://github.com/kevin91nl/remidi/raw/master/data/fools_garden_lemon_tree.mid) MIDI file and the [inverted](https://github.com/kevin91nl/remidi/raw/master/data/fools_garden_lemon_tree_inverted.mid) MIDI file.

## Conclusion

It is actually quite fun to experiment with MIDI files. Except for the poor quality of the music, it gives lots of insights into the dynamics of a piece of music. Have fun with inverting your MIDI files :-)!
