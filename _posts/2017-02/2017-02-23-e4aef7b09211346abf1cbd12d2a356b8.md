Since we're using the (very small) finite field $\mathbb Z_2$ then we can actually list out all the vectors in our chain (group) vector space. We have 3 chain groups, namely the group of 0-simplices (vertices), 1-simplices (edges), and 2-simplices (triangle).

In our example, we only have a single 2-simplex: [a,b,c], thus the group it generates over the field $\mathbb Z_2$ is only $\{0, [a,b,c]\}$ which is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_2$. Recall, in general, the group generated by the number $n$ of $p$-simplices in a simplicial complex is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z^n_2$. For a computer to understand, we can encode the group elements just using their coefficients 1 or 1. So, for example, the group generated by $[a,b,c]$ can just be represented as $\{0,1\}$. Or the group generated by the 0-simplices $\{a, b, c, d\}$ can be represented by 4-dimensional vectors, for example, if a group element is $a+b+c$ then we encode this as $(1, 1, 1, 0)$ where each position represents the presence or abscence of $(a, b, c, d)$, respectively.

Here are all the chain groups represented as vectors with just coefficients (I didn't list all elements for $C_1$ since there are so many [32]):

$$
\begin{align}
C_0
&=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
(0,0,0,0) & (1,0,0,0) & (0,1,1,0) & (0,1,0,1) \\ 
(0,1,0,0) & (0,0,1,0) & (0,0,1,1) & (0,1,1,1) \\ 
(0,0,0,1) & (1,1,0,0) & (1,0,0,1) & (1,0,1,1) \\ 
(1,1,1,0) & (1,1,1,1) & (1,0,1,0) & (1,1,0,1) \\ 
\end{array} 
\right.
& \cong \mathbb Z^4_2
\\
C_1
&=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
(0,0,0,0,0) & (1,0,0,0,0) & (0,1,1,0,0) & (0,1,0,1,0) \\ 
(0,1,0,0,0) & (0,0,1,0,0) & (0,0,1,1,0) & (0,1,1,1,0) \\ 
\dots
\end{array} 
\right.
& \cong \mathbb Z^5_2
\\
C_2
&=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 1
\end{array} 
\right.
& \cong \mathbb Z_2
\end{align}
$$
