|[![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august42013/logo.png)](http://www.yubico.com)|Our company uses a product called [YubiKey](http://www.yubico.com) to provide two-factor authentication. Two factor authentication provides an additional level of security depth over just passwords. This is good.|

Vanilla authentication services typically require just a password. A password can be typed in anywhere. If your password is stolen, or hacked, bad actors can access your account from practically any location that has access to the internet.

Dual factor authentication provides much more security. It’s something you know *and* something you have. Both puzzle pieces are needed to gain access to the account, and if either one is compromised, a thief is still not able to gain access to your account.
|I talked about this very concept at the end of my recent [TEDX](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY3XWYr726I) talk (Shameless plug).|[![](http://datagenetics.com/images/tedxs.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY3XWYr726I)|

### YubiKey
|My laptop now has a physical device plugged into a side USB port. It’s very small, and only slightly protrudes from the side when plugged in. The version I have is called the *YubiKey Nano*.|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august42013/y.png)|
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august42013/n.png)|When plugged in, it behaves like an external keyboard. If I touch it with my finger, after a short delay, it outputs a string of pseudo-random looking characters, something like this:rghrukdnndckdieggjkinjkgdguktfnrIf I were to touch it again, a different string of characters might be generated:vhdbnkjhkubllhikdivtrdceflfkihur|

If I were to touch it again, a different string of characters might be generated:

vhdbnkjhkubllhikdivtrdceflfkihur

To login, I need to type in both my password *and* touch the device to generate a key.

Generated keys can only be used once.
|If my password is stolen, hacked, or compromised, it does not help a thief. If they don’t have my laptop, which has my YubiKey device installed, even with the password, then cannot gain access to my account.Similarly, if my laptop is stolen, without my password, it’s useless as a device to login with.If either these theft scenarios occurs, I can contact my IT department to invalidate the other half and start fresh without worry.Not only has dual factor authentication greatly compounded security, it’s massively reduced the attack surface: No longer is any cybercafé a potential access point to my account. Now, only my laptop will let me in.|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august42013/t.png)|

### Flibbertigibbet

There’s only one downside to the technology and that is, because the key is located on the side of the laptop, and emulates a keyboard, it’s possible to sometimes make a mistake and inadvertently touch the key in the middle of typ*vgbeentndihcfnrctdbtdjntjjgcuukn*ing something else (see what I did there?) and have garbage come out.

Internally, at our office, people share funny memes and stories about these things happening at inappropriate opportunities.

### Pseudo-Random Garbage

Of course, the string output from the device is not random garbage. It’s generated by a clever algorithm that combines a unique ID baked into the device, some checksums all salted by a pseudo random number (some component of which is based on time) to generate a one-time password. You can read more about the device on the [manufacturer’s web site](https://www.yubico.com/support/faq/). The elements that make up each generated key are:

1. The Private identity of the YubiKey

1. Counter fields tracking how often the YubiKey has been used

1. A Timer field tracking the time between generating each OTP

1. A Random number to add additional security to the encryption

1. A closing CRC16 checksum of all the fields


### Encoding

Whilst each generated password is 128 bits in length, these bits need to be converted into a format that it is easy for my computer to digest. Because the device emulates a keyboard, it needs to send the 128 bits in mechanism that emulates keys pressed on a keyboard. Simply sending the raw binary will not work. Some bit patterns could represent non-printable characters, or even be control characters.

The solution is to encode the binary string into a string of safe printable characters. YubiKey does this by converting the key into a 32 character long text string. It’s not efficient packing, but since the keys are short in length, this is not a concern.

It’s also a very clever solution. Since the device emulates a keyboard, no special drivers are needed.

### ModHex

128 bits spread over 32 text characters is four bits per character (16 different possible symbol choices for each character).
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august42013/k.png)|Interestingly, however, the obvious encoding scheme that could be used for this (standard Hex, for instance) is not what is used. Instead a modified hex encoding is used (which they call ModHex).Why? Well it comes down to the fact that keyboards send their messages to the computer, not as the character pressed, but by means of something called a [scan code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_code).|

Why? Well it comes down to the fact that keyboards send their messages to the computer, not as the character pressed, but by means of something called a [scan code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_code).

Translation of the *scan code* to character representation is performed internal to the computer and the keyboard emulator needs to generate the correct letter irrespective of the locale of the device. For instance, English speaking countries have keyboards described as **QWERTY** (the ordering of letters on the top left of the alphabetic part of the keyboard). French keyboards are **AZERTY** and German **QWERTZ**. The encoding scheme selected uses internationally safe letters (lowercase) for the encoding; ones that do not change from keyboard to keyboard.

The following conversion table shows how the device encodes the 4 bits into safe characters:
|0000|0001|0010|0011|0100|0101|0110|0111|1000|1001|1010|1011|1100|1101|1110|1111|

### Geek Stuff

As I was pushing my YubiKey, I was wondering what English words it might be possible to, theoretically, see in my pass string?
|What is the longest word that is possible? You might remember I wrote a similar article a few months ago about [Hex Words](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/march32013/index.html) (You, me, and DEAD people).Below are the results I got from querying an English language database. The longest word is 16 characters long. I've listed the words down to eight characters in length:|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august42013/ky.png)|
