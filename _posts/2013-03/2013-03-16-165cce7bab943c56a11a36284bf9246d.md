It's commonn in *l33t speak* to use the number 3 to represent the letter E, but since we already have this letter there is no point in using this coversion!

The letter G converts to the number 9. Using your imagination you can see it looks a little like a lowercase g.

Notice that both the letter L and letter I can convert into the nuumber 1. This can get confussing if the donor word contains a mixture of both of these letters that are converted to the number 1. To highlight this in the table below, words that are displayed in lightred are words that have more than one number 1 and these came from non-distinct source letters (These words contain a mixture of the letters L and I).

Some of the *l33t* words are easier to read in lowercase than uppercase, so for each found word I have shown both varients.
