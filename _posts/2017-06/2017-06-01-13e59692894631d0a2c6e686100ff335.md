Several weeks back we ran our 4th [PyDataLondon (2017) conference](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup) – it was another smashing success! This builds on our previous 3 years of effort ([2016](http://ianozsvald.com/2016/05/10/pydatalondon-2016-conference-write-up), [2015](http://ianozsvald.com/2015/06/21/pydatalondon-2015-write-up-and-my-ship-it-talk-on-publishing-data-science-products), [2014](http://ianozsvald.com/2014/02/24/pydatalondon-2014)) building both the [conference](http://pydata.org/london2017) and our over-subscribed [monthly meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup). We’re grateful to our host Bloomberg for providing the lovely staff, venue and catering.

> Really got inspired by @genekogan’s great talk on AI & the visual arts at @pydatalondon [@annabellerol](https://twitter.com/annabellerol/status/861224614957129728)

Each year we try some new ideas – this year we tried:

> *pros*: Great selection of talks for all levels and pub quiz *cons*: on a weekend, pub quiz (was hard). Overall would recommend 9/10 [@harpal_sahota](https://twitter.com/harpal_sahota/status/861241387974627328)

We’re very thankful to all our sponsors for their financial support and to all our speakers for donating their time to share their knowledge. Personally I say a big thank-you to Ruby (co-chair) and Linda (review committee lead) – I resigned both of these roles this year after 3 years and I’m very happy to have been replaced so effectively (ahem – Linda – you really have shown how much better the review committee could be run!). Ruby joined Emlyn as co-chair for the conference, I took a back-seat on both roles and supported where I could. Our volunteer team great again – thanks Agata for pulling this together.

I believe we had 20% female attendees – up from 15% or so [last year](http://ianozsvald.com/2016/05/10/pydatalondon-2016-conference-write-up). Here’s a write-up from [Srjdan](https://medium.springboard.com/interesting-talks-from-pydata-london-2017-d17b06c1ed5e) and another [from FullFact](https://fullfact.org/blog/2017/may/automated-factchecking-pydata-conference-london-2017) (and one from Vincent as chair at [PyDataAmsterdam](http://koaning.io/chair-at-a-conference.html) earlier this year) – thanks!

> #PyDataLdn thank you for organising a great conference. My first one & hope to attend more. Will recommend it to my fellow humanists! [@1208DL](https://twitter.com/1208DL/status/861272105412907009)

For this year I’ve been collaborating with two colleagues – Dr Gusztav Belteki and Giles Weaver – to [automate the analysis of baby ventilator data with the NHS](https://speakerdeck.com/ianozsvald/machine-learning-with-ventilator-data-to-improve-reporting-on-critically-ill-newborn-infants). I was very happy to have the 3 of us present to speak on our progress, we’ve been using RandomForests to segment time-series breath data to (mostly) correctly identify the start of baby breaths on 100Hz single-channel air-flow data. This is the precursor step to starting our automated summarisation of a baby’s breathing quality.
