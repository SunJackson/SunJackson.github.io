In 2013, I was an embedded team member at IDEO during an externship
swap. I was there to help IDEO think about how
they could use data for prototyping during a project. To begin, the IDEO team
performed some qualitative research to learn what consumers needed and wanted,
then we ran a quantitative survey online. As the results trickled in, we
started to analyze the data.

## My jaw dropped

10+ different versions of Excel spreadsheets proliferated throughout the team
of 4 designers. Our results needed to be analyzed quickly, but it was very
difficult to keep track of what things meant and who had the most recent
"clean" version due to the haphazard nature of the analysis. I begged the
team, "Please, just give me your data and an afternoon and I think I can
help."

Later that day, I showed them an early version of what would eventually become
[catcorr.js](https://github.com/ideo/catcorrjs), a JavaScript
library that is useful for visualizing correlations between categorical
variables. Being able to see all of the data in one place was an immediate win
for the IDEO project team. We were now able to quickly and collaboratively
explore different narratives from our qualitative research in order to
evaluate whether or not the quantitative survey results supported or refuted
our hypotheses.

Over the past few years, Datascope has worked on a couple of other projects
that needed a visual comparison across several dimensions of categorical data,
much like the analysis for that initial IDEO team. With this, we realized that
there was a broader opportunity for catcorr.js beyond a simple visualization
package.

## An opportunity

You see, the default mode for analysis in consumer research today generally
involves creating and printing out "[crosstabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table)", then scouring the results by hand to
highlight significant and interesting findings. Crosstabs, which have been a
mainstay in the industry for 40+ years, allow an analyst to "not miss
anything", but present an overwhelmingly large view of data and lack the
flexibility, automation, and intelligence that have become pervasive in
analytics tools across other industries. As a data scientist, I found
crosstabs appalling and concerning. With dozens or even hundreds of rows of
dense figures in a single table, how could you be sure that you wouldn't miss
a significant insight? How could you be sure that your personal biases weren't
influencing the story that you were telling about the data? How might we
improve the process of consumer research to focusing on developing novel
hypotheses instead of sweating the details of crosstabs?

## From a v0.3.1 open-source package to the release of Elemetric

During the summer of 2016, Datascope launched a project to turn catcorr.js
into something more compelling and robust that went beyond intuitive
visualizations. We were interested in developing an automated insights engine
that could quickly identify the most compelling results in an unbiased way.
[Yoke Peng](https://datascopeanalytics.com/team/yoke-peng-leong) and
[Damien](https://datascopeanalytics.com/team/damien-brule) did
an awesome job and quickly got us to a minimum viable product (MVP) that we
could put in front of customers.

At the same time, we began performing due diligence to size the market and
better understand the tools, processes, and companies within the consumer
research space. It turned out that our hunches about fragmented tool sets and
processes were true. At a deeper level, though, we found underlying issues in
the space that went beyond the use of fragmented analytics software, including
a dependence on expensive and inefficient agencies, an expectation of projects
to take multiple months to return results, and the confession that survey data
was often inaccurate or poorly contextualized due to the pools of respondents
being used.

Additionally, the industry was changing rapidly. When most market research
platforms were being developed, data was an expensive luxury, brokered by
firms like Nielsen or IRI that had achieved the massive scale required to
provide relevant data. Modern companies don't struggle with data--in fact they
have more than enough--the biggest issues are around modeling and developing
insights that can be leveraged in real-time, to meet increasingly rapid
business demands. Ultimately, the problem turned out to be the same as it had
been for decades, to convert a hairy business problem into a quantifiable
survey, clean up the data, analyze the results, and tell a story to key
stakeholders that makes sense and is actionable. We began to see clearly,
though, that incumbent providers were doing an increasingly poor job providing
solutions that fit the needs of a new generation of agile, data-first
companies.

With an area so ripe for disruption, we realized that it would be foolish to
create this product under the Datascope umbrella. The new concept needed to
raise funding. It needed to be ruthlessly dedicated to product. And, most
importantly, it needed to be laser focused on consumer research (at least to
start). We needed to create a new entity, [Elemetric](https://elemetric.io/.), run
by CEO Daniel Mason.

In the months since, Elemetric has made substantial progress toward realizing
the vision of creating a consumer research platform for the smarter, faster
needs of data-first consumer products companies. Elemetric hired Neel Kothari
to lead the development efforts, and has honed its vision and extended the
functionality of the original application. Elemetric is building a survey and
research platform that sits on top of the breadth of information constantly
flowing through marketing, sales, communication, and eCommerce software within
consumer goods companies today, turning a company's user base (customers and
non-customers) into a powerful and inexpensive wealth of information to inform
product and marketing decisions. Elemetric is working with selected companies
in a closed Beta program, and and is currently participating in IDEO's
Startup in Residence program. Additionally, Elemetric is close to closing a pre-seed round funding round
from angel investors.

We couldn't be more excited to announce the launch of Elemetric, the goal of
which is to help consumer researchers do what they do best: consumer research
(not data munging in Excel).
