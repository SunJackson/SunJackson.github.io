Van der Waerden's theorem is a theorem in the branch of mathematics called Ramsey theory.

It relates to ways that collections can be coloured, in order, avoiding spacing of colours that are a defined length arithmetic progression apart. They are named after the Dutch mathematician [B. L. van der Waerden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartel_Leendert_van_der_Waerden). In pure form they can be described as **W(c,k)**, where *c* represents the number of colours in the sequence, and *k* represents the number of elements in the arithmetic progression.

The simplest (non-trivial) example is **W(2,3)**

In the diagram below you can see there are currently eight boxed shaded with two colours (Red and Blue) *c=2*.

Above, there are no sequences of either blue or red that form a three step *k=3* chain.

If a ninth element were to be added to the end of the sequence, if it were coloured red, then cells 3,6,9 would be a three chain arithmetic sequence. If it were coloured blue, then 1,5,9 would be in progression.

There is no way of coloring 1 through 9 without creating a three step progression of one colour or another, so **W(2,3)**=9

The above sequence is not unique; there are six solutions (which includes the rotations, reflections and complements).

## W(3,3)

If we add another colour, and keep the max sequenece to three, then the length increases to 27.

There are 48 solutions to **W(3,3)**. A couple are shown below:

## W(2,4)

If we keep at two colours, and increase the max length of the arithmetic prgression to four then the length increases to 35.

There are 28 solutions to **W(2,4)**. A couple are shown below:

## W(2,5)

Increasing the progression length to five, the value of **W(2,5)**=178

Here is one solution in string form:

## All known

Below is a table of the [known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden_number) Van der Waerden numbers.

There are currently only seven non-trivial numbers known. For the others, lower bounds have been determined, even though values are not currently known.

## Off Diagonal Waerden numbers

All the examples above have been symmetric across the colours. For instance for **W(3,3)**, each of the colours has the same restriction of not having a sequence of more the three in arithmetic progression. For off diagonal numbers, each colour can have in individual restriction on progression length *e.g.* **W(3; 3,3,4)**. Here the first colour can have no number than three elements in a progression, the second three, and the third four.

Here are a couple of examples, with a sample for each:

**W(3; 3,3,4)**=51
