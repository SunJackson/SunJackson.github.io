![](https://florianhartl.com/wp-content/uploads/Nutch-Plugin-Tutorial-350x233.jpg)
In one of my [previous posts](https://florianhartl.com/nutch-how-it-works.html) about Nutch, I already mentioned plugins. The plugin system is central to how Nutch works and allows you to customize Nutch to your personal needs in a very flexible and maintainable way. Everybody who wants to use Nutch for other things than just playing around will be challenged to write an own plugin at one point or another. Indeed, there are many settings which can be changed within the files ‘nutch-default.xml’ or rather ‘nutch-site.xml’. But simply imagine you would like to add a new field to the index by doing some custom analysis of a parsed web page content, saving the result in a new variable and passing it to Solr as an additional field. This fairly plain example should be a quite common scenario and it requires you to implement a plugin. Of course, instead of writing additional code for the plugin, you could also alter the existing code of Nutch and therewith achieve the desired behavior. However, on the one hand you might have maintainability issues once you need to use a newer version of the Nutch project and on the other hand, developing a new plugin is easier and faster anyways. I have to say though, that “easier” does not mean “easy”. Turns out that writing a plugin is not trivial at all and requires a series of steps. This is why I will try to walk you through the process of creating a plugin and thereby hopefully help you in getting your own plugin started. Please notice, that this tutorial is based on Nutch 1.4. It may not work with other versions of Nutch.

**The Use Case**As already mentioned above, I simply would like to add a new field to the index. This new field should indicate the length of the parsed content of the respective web page and therefore be called “pageLength”.

**Where to Start**Every plugin needs to extend one or more already existing interfaces called extension-points. A list of the most important extension points can be found [here](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/AboutPlugins). For our use case, we need to extend ‘IndexingFilter’, since we want to customize the indexing process.

**Required Files**As a first step, you need to create all the necessary new files. Lets say, we call the plugin “myPlugin”. Then you need to create the new folder $NUTCH_HOME/src/plugin/myPlugin. Next, simply copy and paste all the files from the urlmeta-plugin ($NUTCH_HOME/src/plugin/urlmeta) to the myPlugin-folder. Now, rename and delete the adequate files and directories in order to get the following structure (you can do this within Eclipse as well as directly on the file system):





|


myPlugin/
||myPlugin/  plugin.xml  build.xml  ivy.xml  src/    java/      org/        apache/          nutch/            indexer/              AddField.java|

  build.xml

  src/

      org/

          nutch/

              AddField.java

 

**plugin.xml**Your plugin.xml file should look like this (for comparison: you can find another example on the [PluginCentral](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/PluginCentral)):


|1234567891011121314151617|<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><plugin id="myPlugin" name="Add Field to Index"    version="1.0.0" provider-name="your name">    <runtime>     <library name="myPlugin.jar">       <export name="*"/>     </library>   </runtime>    <extension id="org.apache.nutch.indexer.myPlugin"       name="Add Field to Index"       point="org.apache.nutch.indexer.IndexingFilter">     <implementation id="myPlugin"         class="org.apache.nutch.indexer.AddField"/>   </extension></plugin>|

<plugin id="myPlugin" name="Add Field to Index"

 

     <library name="myPlugin.jar">

     </library>

 

       name="Add Field to Index"

     <implementation id="myPlugin"

   </extension>

 

**build.xml & ivy.xml**While the ivy.xml-file can stay exactly the same, you need to change one phrase in the build.xml to get the following result:


||<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><project name="myPlugin" default="jar">  <import file="../build-plugin.xml"/></project>|

<project name="myPlugin" default="jar">

</project>

 

**AddFieldToIndex.java**This is the location where you finally can become creative and implement the desired customization to Nutch.

import org.apache.nutch.indexer.NutchDocument;

 

 

 private Configuration conf;

 CrawlDatum datum, Inlinks inlinks) {

 //adds the new field to the document

 return doc;

 

 public Configuration getConf() {

 }

 //Boilerplate

 this.conf = conf;

}

 

**Final Configurations**Before you can observe the new plugin up and running and hopefully be happy about its performance, there are a couple more configuration steps you need to consider. The first one is to add the plugin to .src/plugin/build.xml. Therefore simply add the following line of code to the ‘Build & Deploy’ section of the file.





|


<ant dir="myPlugin" target="deploy" />
||<ant dir="myPlugin" target="deploy" />|

Next, edit your ./conf/nutch-site.xml and add a block like this:


||<property>  <name>plugin.includes</name>  <value>protocol-http|urlfilter-regex|parse-(html|tika)|index-(basic|anchor)|          scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)|myPlugin</value>  <description>Added myPlugin</description></property>|

  <name>plugin.includes</name>

          scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)|myPlugin</value>

</property>

Usually you could compile Nutch at this point and start using the plugin. However, since we want to add a new field to the index, we need to let Nutch know about our intentions. This is why you need to add the code below to $NUTCH_HOME/conf/schema.xml in the <fields> section. In case its not the first time you run Nutch using Solr, you also need to add the code to $SOLR_HOME/…/solr/conf/schema.xml.





|


<field name="pageLength" type="long" stored="true" indexed="true"/>
||<field name="pageLength" type="long" stored="true" indexed="true"/>|

Also, go ahead and add the following line to $NUTCH_HOME/conf/solrindex-mapping.xml.





|


<field dest="pageLength" source="pageLength"/>
||<field dest="pageLength" source="pageLength"/>|

Side note: If you installed Nutch correctly, then performing all these changes in $NUTCH_HOME/conf/ is sufficient as Nutch will propagate them to $NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local/conf/ as soon as you build Nutch.

Now, in a last step, you need to build Nutch by executing $NUTCH_HOME/build.xml.

 

**DONE**Sit back, relax and enjoy watching your plugin doing hard work. A possible result could look like this:

**Wrap Up**I tried to keep the use case as simple as possible, as there are many configuration tasks that need to be taken care of. But once you understand the fundamentals of the plugin-concept of Nutch as well as how to get a plugin working, then you should also be capable of implementing even very comprehensive and challenging plugins – if you know how to program of course. In case you are still facing problems when trying to get your first plugin running, leave me a comment below and I will be happy to help. On the other hand, if the tutorial was helpful for you, it would be great to hear about that as well.

**Additional Useful Resources****–**[An insightful blog post](http://sujitpal.blogspot.de/2009/07/nutch-custom-plugin-to-parse-and-add.html) that helped me a lot when I was developing my first plugin– the Apache Nutch [PluginCentral](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/PluginCentral)– take a look at an already implemented plugin that works: $NUTCH_HOME/src/plugin/urlmeta
