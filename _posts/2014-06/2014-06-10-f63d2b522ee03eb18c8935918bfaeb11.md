Cycling in Seattle seems to be taking off. This can be seen qualitatively in the increased visibility of advocacy groups like [Seattle Neighborhood Greenways](http://seattlegreenways.org/) and [Cascade Bicycle Club](http://www.cascade.org/), the excellent reporting of sites like the [Seattle Bike Blog](http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/), and the investment by the city in high-profile traffic safety projects such as [Protected Bike Lanes](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/PBL.htm), [Road diets/Rechannelizations](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/pedestrian_masterplan/pedestrian_toolbox/tools_deua_diets.htm) and the [Seattle Bicycle Master Plan](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bikemaster.htm).

But, qualitative arguments aside, there is also an increasing array of quantitative data available, primarily from the [Bicycle counters](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bikecounter.htm) installed at key locations around the city. The first was the [Fremont Bridge Bicycle Counter](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bikecounter_fremont.htm), installed in October 2012, which gives daily updates on the number of bicycles crossing the bridge: currently upwards of 5000-6000 per day during sunny commute days.

Bicycle advocates have been [pointing out](http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2014/05/14/fremont-bridge-smashes-bike-count-record-for-real-this-time-bike-use-rises-all-over-town) the upward trend of the counter, and I must admit I've been excited as anyone else to see this surge in popularity of cycling (Most days, I bicycle 22 miles round trip, crossing both the Spokane St. and Fremont bridge each way).

But anyone who looks closely at the data must admit: there is a large weekly and monthly swing in the bicycle counts, and people seem most willing to ride on dry, sunny summer days. Given the warm streak we've had in Seattle this spring, I wondered: **are we really seeing an increase in cycling, or can it just be attributed to good weather?**

Here I've set-out to try and answer this question. Along the way, we'll try to deduce just how much the weather conditions affect Seattleites' transportation choices.
