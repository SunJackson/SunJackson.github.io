I’m assuming that some people who see my talk at Demystifying Data Science conference will be dropping by here, so I wanted to put up a quick post summarizing some of the resources I have made available to data science learners.

If you haven’t signed up for the conference yet, it’s free online, going on now (10am to 10pm 9/27/2017) and you can sign up at this link. Everyone who registers will get access to the videos afterward.

Here’s some stuff to help you on your data science journey!
