Join The Data Incubator and Katrina Riehl, Director of Data Science for HomeAway.com, for the July 2018 installment of our free monthly webinar series, Data Science in 30 minutes: The Accidental Data Scientist.

Katrina will detail the journey her career has taken from researcher and software developer to Data Scientist. She will explain how her technology roles and skills have evolved as this new discipline emerged over the last decade. First, starting out as a young Python and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast and eventually after many years, finally embracing Data Science as a discipline, and leading a strong and diverse Data Science team.
