[This](http://git.sympy.org/?p=sympy.git;a=commit;h=dd679c2751ac0900c47302fd6187ae9eea60918f) commit introduced a new module in sympy: the refine module. The
purpose of this module is to simplify expressions when they are bound to
assumptions. For example, if you know that x>0, then you can simplify
abs(x) to x. This code was traditionally embedded into the core, but now
this will be part of an external module (sympy.refine) upon which the
core has no dependencies. In a not very original move, I named the main
function in this module refine(). It's syntax is very straightforward:
first argument is an expression and second argument are assumptions.
Some examples (from isympy): In [1]: refine(1+abs(x), Assume(x,
Q.positive)) Out[1]: 1 + x In [2]: refine(exp(I*x*pi), Assume(x,
Q.odd)) Out[2]: -1 In [3]: refine(exp(I*x*pi), Assume(x, Q.even))
Out[3]: 1 Right now the module lacks some rules, but the design (very
similar to the query module) will make adding these rules an easy task.
