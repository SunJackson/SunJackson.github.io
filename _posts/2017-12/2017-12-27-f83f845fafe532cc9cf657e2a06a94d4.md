At this point it is pretty clear that the stock market was a **yuge** winner in 2017. So was bitcoin. How did other assets do? Currencies? Energies? Let’s take a look.



## Indexes

An absolute win. With the booming economy, likely to continue.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|S&P 500|20.39%|
|Nasdaq|31.80%|
|Russell 2000|13.93%|
|S&P 400|14.89%|
|Dow Jones|26.46%|
|Nikkei|20.39%|

## Bonds

Gains on the long bond, about break even on the shorter.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|30-Year US T-Bond|3.96%|
|10-Year US T-Note|0.58%|
|5-Year US T-Note|0.3%|
|2-Year US T-Note|0.57%|

## Oils

Nothing much happening – trading in a range.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|Crude Oil|3.06%|
|Heating Oil|13.99%|
|RBOB Gasoline|3.36%|
|Natural Gas|39.86%|

## Metals

With the economy booming, the industrial metals exploded. The precious, not that much. Still, all positive.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|Copper|26.22%|
|Sivler|1.38%|
|Gold|9.82%|
|Palladium|54.39%|
|Platinum|0.85%|

## Currencies

Drastic moves (10% for a currency is **a lot**). The theme being the US dollar losing value.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|Euro|10.46%|
|Japanese Yen|1.49%|
|British Pound|7.36%|
|Swiss Franc|0.63%|
|US Dollar Index|8.44%|
|Canadian Dollar|5.57%|
|Australian Dollar|7.86%|

## Softs

Some pretty drastic moves in both directions. Lumber is close to all time highs, for example.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|Coffee|19.18%|
|Cotton|13.82%|
|Cocoa|15.37%|
|Orange Juice|24.78%|
|Sugar|27.23%|
|Lumber|50.08%|

## Grains

Mostly red. Food for thought: wheat and corn getting cheaper by non-trivial amounts. To me that’s a testament of what technology does for our food supply.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|Oats|6.57%|
|Corn|12.14%|
|Soy Beans|8.01%|
|Soy Bean Meal|4.94%|
|Soy Bean Oil|7.30%|
|Wheat|14.74%|
|KC Wheat|17.00%|

## Meats

Just for completeness.

|Asset|Gain/Loss
|------
|Lean Hogs|0.39%|
|Live Cattle|8.63%|
|Feeder Cattle|15.11%|
