We continue our [![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-server_problem) series ([see post 1 here](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2017/12/16/k-server-part-1-online-learning-and-online-algorithms)). In this post we briefly discuss the concept of a fractional solution for ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server, which by analogy with [MTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrical_task_system) will in fact be a fractional “anti-solution”. Then we introduce the continuous time version of MTS and explain how it applies for ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server. Finally the most important part of the post is the description of the basic potential based analysis of [mirror descent](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2013/04/16/orf523-mirror-descent-part-iii) and how to interpret it in the context of MTS.

 

**State representation for MTS**

Recall the MTS problem: one maintains a random state ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-78f53a1fdecd311793b13ded7e98625b_l3.png?resize=56%2C18&ssl=1)
 (where ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-41be326990cb1584673965aedcfb1d0d_l3.png?resize=17%2C18&ssl=1)
 is equipped with a distance ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&ssl=1)
), and given a new cost function ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ebbdcfdcca1e72fbfb217c681ddd2acb_l3.png?resize=117%2C18&ssl=1)
, one can update the state to ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7ddd6890d50f20cbbe7382679fe24161_l3.png?resize=31%2C13&ssl=1)
 with the corresponding price to pay: ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-78a6eeefca0bfe5ecf7e7bc8a4be708f_l3.png?resize=176%2C19&ssl=1)
. Equivalently one can maintain the probability distribution ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5888b551efebc2286cdae771fa354f02_l3.png?resize=271%2C20&ssl=1)
 of ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a2773f5a02931e0bd282b197375b9cb9_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&ssl=1)

 one can obtain ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7ddd6890d50f20cbbe7382679fe24161_l3.png?resize=31%2C13&ssl=1)
 by optimal coupling, that is the couple of random variables ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9e3f6d014fc7ca7509eb363ee91e16cc_l3.png?resize=67%2C19&ssl=1)
 minimizes the expected distance ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bff942a8531ed5ecedb7c2f6d7ab7389_l3.png?resize=55%2C18&ssl=1)
 over all couples ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-99855ce4147d5a9aaf01b08b7295e5d0_l3.png?resize=44%2C18&ssl=1)
 such that ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ab67eda06fcf093fb3178b85c9214045_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&ssl=1)
 has marginal ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-88d1a664e8455886f41d20d4d09266af_l3.png?resize=15%2C12&ssl=1)
 and ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-cc9f8fff9fd24060bc054e78f01d5bfb_l3.png?resize=12%2C12&ssl=1)

 (the latter quantity is called the Wasserstein-![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&ssl=1)

). In this view the (expected) service cost is now a linear function, that is ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9740b4cbecd3ab7d3de5ef2b2441c45f_l3.png?resize=40%2C12&ssl=1)

, and the movement cost between ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-88d1a664e8455886f41d20d4d09266af_l3.png?resize=15%2C12&ssl=1)

 is the Wasserstein-![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&ssl=1)
 distance.

We will further assume the existence of a convex body ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&ssl=1)
 and a norm ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b0324de08c779574705ebf34b4935265_l3.png?resize=27%2C19&ssl=1)

) such that the Wasserstein-![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&ssl=1)
 distance between two distributions ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-80fb074cbddb95a4f5533189d36d5a11_l3.png?resize=72%2C16&ssl=1)
 is equal to ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-584a9b8b5f83b9e3c0611b4c2b788ffc_l3.png?resize=55%2C19&ssl=1)
 where ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-953d0cfb98f02bb512391a49a4ac37d7_l3.png?resize=65%2C17&ssl=1)
 are “expanded states” with ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-abd950e5c52efc778151e9cd51f8cc1f_l3.png?resize=123%2C18&ssl=1)
 and ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-010a184c4afc4d7c4300fa56a6c2a0d1_l3.png?resize=119%2C18&ssl=1)
. For a weighted star metric it suffices to take ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-529a94f713a9453a737f12e17c49371d_l3.png?resize=63%2C15&ssl=1)
, but we will see in the fourth post that for trees one indeed need to expand the state space.

Fractional solution for ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server

Recall the ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server problem: one maintains a random configuration ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d834cd09baf6afc238d28a1b3d637ecb_l3.png?resize=65%2C20&ssl=1)
, and given a new request ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-84385e3a005261d946283b33a02caf16_l3.png?resize=72%2C18&ssl=1)
 one must update the configuration to ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7ddd6890d50f20cbbe7382679fe24161_l3.png?resize=31%2C13&ssl=1)
 such that ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-00f9c2ea9b7b0e275329f1eea4adf4a9_l3.png?resize=221%2C19&ssl=1)
. One could equivalently maintain a distribution ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-34b27a1398eb146f838ca82ce21cc032_l3.png?resize=66%2C16&ssl=1)
 as before. In the *fractional* problem one in fact only maintains the ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-418c971e449a5e10f64fc250c39286d7_l3.png?resize=19%2C16&ssl=1)
 moment of this distribution, ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-14bf8cf45221ff2906a401612b0ebab2_l3.png?resize=311%2C20&ssl=1)
, defined by ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bd3c67c05f7121fbe2cd2ec263be31d0_l3.png?resize=257%2C23&ssl=1)
 (in particular servicing a request a location ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8511b1f6cf9db17d46ddabb67bac99f5_l3.png?resize=6%2C12&ssl=1)
 means that one must have ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-753294d1868e4bfa2a3e6c7bdac908fe_l3.png?resize=66%2C18&ssl=1)
). Again the metric here on the ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d9d772a59543419785ce66946592259a_l3.png?resize=9%2C8&ssl=1)
 variables is the Wasserstein distance induced by ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&ssl=1)
 (a.k.a., the optimal transport distance). Importantly we note that this view is *not* equivalent to maintaining a full distribution (indeed a lot of information is lost by recording only the first moment). This raises the subtle issue of whether one can *round online* a fractional solution to a proper integral solution whose total movement is of the same order of magnitude. We will not touch upon this question here, and we focus on the fractional ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server problem, see for example [Section 5.2 here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1580.pdf) for more. We note however that the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for this rounding task is an open problem.

To think of the request as a linear cost function (like in MTS) it is more appropriate to work with the *anticonfiguration* ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1561dc5a77ad5c866f5431df41041f95_l3.png?resize=73%2C13&ssl=1)
. In this view a request ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8f656311867e9b5f057fe7c267c3f09b_l3.png?resize=49%2C18&ssl=1)
 is equivalent to a cost vector ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3a6ce56be7426cf79bc728a893c473f8_l3.png?resize=98%2C14&ssl=1)
. Finally like in MTS we will assume the existence of an expanded state space ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3392628fa1ae4de284016c973ed3bc07_l3.png?resize=65%2C16&ssl=1)
 and a norm ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b0324de08c779574705ebf34b4935265_l3.png?resize=27%2C19&ssl=1)
 that measures movement in this expanded view.

**Continuous time decision making**

We will now move to a continuous time setting, where the (discrete time) sequence of cost vectors is revealed continuously as a path ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d5049a2663a845080dbd5aca216ef9f1_l3.png?resize=73%2C21&ssl=1)

). The decision maker’s reponse is a path ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1a96b31e6820864b2376b6be50de0456_l3.png?resize=75%2C21&ssl=1)

. In this setting the service cost of the algorithm is ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-aeb936d374bcb18917616edc02255d53_l3.png?resize=89%2C20&ssl=1)
 and the movement cost is equal to ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c22d3981559a53a47a5793911f413b15_l3.png?resize=99%2C20&ssl=1)
 where ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b0b8a7370bc08271c06ed39b750880ce_l3.png?resize=34%2C18&ssl=1)
 is the time derivative of the path ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ff65be45891a46ced2f45cbe9dcf1372_l3.png?resize=29%2C18&ssl=1)
. We note that there is small subtelty here to translate the continuous time service cost into a meaningful discrete time service cost, but we will not worry about this here since it does not affect the argument for ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server (where there is only a movement cost). If you are curious see [the appendix here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b714/10d26ae1bb87fdd330004f3f289301b522b1.pdf).

 (which means that ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a78a0ec71052e0846acc9ffa36aa637b_l3.png?resize=73%2C13&ssl=1)

**Mirror descent**

If you have never seen the mirror descent framework now is a good time to take [a quick look here](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2013/04/16/orf523-mirror-descent-part-iii).

 can be written as follows, with a step-size ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-86bde2afc6c0858d01ac505267801f02_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)

 in the above definition to find the continuous time mirror descent update. For that let us recall the first order optimality condition for constrained optimization.

In particular we see that (note that ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bfdc8ce2886c8e749f4425f477bdbace_l3.png?resize=236%2C18&ssl=1)

and thus taking ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-86bde2afc6c0858d01ac505267801f02_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)

 we morally get

This type of equation is known as [a differential inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion), and with the added constraint that the path must live in the constraint set ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&ssl=1)
 we get a *viability problem*. In our paper we show that a solution indeed exist (and is unique) under mild assumptions on ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8581dbc45f448345dcc6bd9caed502e9_l3.png?resize=12%2C14&ssl=1)

**Potential based analysis**

The mirror descent algorithm is fully described by:

Denoting ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-08e6309b130489bcfe6d02cf0c4ce0a1_l3.png?resize=281%2C21&ssl=1)
 we see that for any fixed ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)

The above calculation is the key to understand mirror descent: it says that if the algorithm is currently paying more than ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)
, i.e., ![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6e6739ad1b22b49ab25fbde41bc55d2d_l3.png?resize=148%2C18&ssl=1)
, then it is actually getting closer to ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)
 in the sense that ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-30a9981bb57154029d3b80ccb40d17a6_l3.png?resize=86%2C21&ssl=1)
 is decreasing. Put differently: when the algorithm pays, it also learns. This key insight is sufficient for online learning, where one competes against a fixed point ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)
. However in MTS and ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&ssl=1)
-server we compete against a path ![](https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a2f33825c8ec052e86696209360348d4_l3.png?resize=28%2C18&ssl=1)
, and thus we also need to evaluate by how much the Bregman divergence can go up when ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&ssl=1)
 is moving. This is captured by the following calculation:

     ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-67fc268d2f783593522e1630934c8c8b_l3.png?resize=290%2C53&ssl=1)


Putting together the two above calculations we obtain the following control on the service cost of mirror descent in terms of the service cost and movement cost of the optimal path:

 satisfies for any comparator path ![](https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7ca14d1082df46868e47a9ff0ce66a46_l3.png?resize=65%2C19&ssl=1)

At this point the big question is: how do we control the movement of mirror descent? In the next post we will see how this plays out on a weighted star.
