(this is one of the projects of the *[#openimpact shortlist](http://blog.datalook.io/openimpact-project-shortlist)*)

The tool accesses the Twitter API to scan for instances of the phrase “food poisoning” tweeted within the geographic bounds of Chicago. Tweets caught by a classification algorithm are manually sorted for legitimacy and relevance, and any users identified as possible victims of food poisoning are tweeted a message to visit the Foodborne Chicago website, where they can report their illness to the CDPH via the city’s Open311 system. The health department then examines those cases the same as it does those received from all other channels.
|**What does it do?**|A twitter bot that searches tweets related to food poisoning in chicago to direct the victims to a 311-service form.|
