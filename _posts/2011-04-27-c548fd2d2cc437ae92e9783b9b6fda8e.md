I've been working lately in improving the low-level API of the libsvm
bindings in scikit-learn. The goal is to provide an API that encourages
an efficient use of these libraries for expert users. These are methods
that have lower overhead than the [object-oriented interface](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/modules/svm.html) as they
are closer to the C implementation, but do not have an interface as
polished. Here, all parameters are expected to be of the correct type,
and submitting one of the wrong type will make the function exit
immediately with a ValueError. For instance, input data is expected to
be of type float64, even for class labels! Another peculiarity of these
methods is that they only take and return numpy arrays. No custom
objects, all method take and return arrays. That looks something like:
[cc lang="python"] import numpy as np from scikits.learn import svm,
datasets iris = datasets.load_iris() iris.target =
iris.target.astype(np.float64) learned_params =
svm.libsvm.fit(iris.data, iris.target) pred =
svm.libsvm.predict(iris.data, *learned_params) [/cc] Here, I used the
fact that the parameters returned by [libsvm.fit](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/dev/modules/generated/scikits.learn.svm.libsvm.fit.html) can just passed to
[libsvm.predict](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/dev/modules/generated/scikits.learn.svm.libsvm.predict.html). However, any other given parameters should be
manually passed to both method.
