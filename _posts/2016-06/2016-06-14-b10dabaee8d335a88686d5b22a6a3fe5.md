** Tue 14 June 2016

 

[Kinesis Corporation](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/) has produced a long-awaited update to their Savant
Elite line of foot pedals. If you find yourself with wrist or RSI pain, you
might consider giving them a look.

> 
Disclaimer: Kinesis Corporation sent me an evaluation model of the SE 2 foot
 pedal. As a long time fan (and advocate for anyone who helps people overcome
 RSI problems) I agreed to write a blog about it!


## Being that weird person with the foot pedals

*click* *click* *click*

**"What is that noise? Are you doing something with your feet?"**

I step back from my desk and show them. Then I explain how, years ago, I had to
decide between capitalizing words and having the ulnar corner of my left wrist
be painful to the touch. Luckily, I got my RSI under control, but it's left me
with artifacts that have become essential to my hacking environment:

- Kinesis Advantage keyboard

- Kinesis Foot Pedals

- Evoluent Vertical Mouse

Admittedly, I mostly use the foot pedal now for pressing shift. As an Emacs
user, I considered using them for Control or Meta (as the old saying goes:
"Emacs: Escape Meta Alt Control Shift!"), but never got into the habit of it.

## Aging technology

The biggest problem with the Kinesis SE1 line of foot pedals, which many people
swear by, is that you can only program them using an extremely old Windows
program, and it's such a finicky process it might as well be a digital rain
dance. Here's what my SE1's look like:

I programmed my pedals in 2010 and haven't changed them since. This is a bummer
since you can associate fairly complex macros / character sequences with them,
and often when faced with a repetitive task I've wished I could quickly program
something in.

While cosmetically and functionally the SE2 has changed little, the software
and firmware is completely new. Programming them is now a breeze. Howard
Abrams gives more detail on how the program works. It's even bundled on the
foot pedal, so you aren't left digging around the Kinesis website to find
it. It can't be run on Linux, but once you program the foot pedal it will work
on any computer.

The biggest issue I have hit (as mostly a Linux user) is that OS X won't allow
modifier keys from one USB device to modify another. So while my pedal-as-Shift
works fine on Linux, it doesn't work on Mac. So if you want to off-load
modifier keys, and you use a Mac, *caveat emptor*.

## Summary

If you've ever been curious about using foot pedals to improve your computer
ergonomics I recommend giving a 2- or 3-pedal Kinesis set a look. I had stopped
recommending them to people because of the programmability issue, but now that
the hardware and software has been renovated, now is the time to give them your
consideration. Like all Kinesis components, you can expect no problems in any 5
to 10 year period.
