 Gradient boosting (GB) is a machine learning algorithm developed in the late '90s that is still very
 popular.
 It produces state-of-the-art results for many commercial (and academic) applications.
 


 This page explains how the gradient boosting algorithm works using several interactive visualizations.

Look from above



 We take a 2-dimensional regression problem and investigate how a tree is able to reconstruct the function
 \( y = f(\mathbf{x}) = f(x_1, x_2) \).
 Play with the tree depth, then look at the tree-building process from above!
 

## Explanation: how the tree is built?


 First, let's revisit how a decision tree works.
 A decision tree is a fairly simple classifier which splits the space of features into regions by
 applying trivial splitting (e.g. \( x_2 < 2.4 \) ).
 The resulting regions have a rectangular form. In each region the predictions are constant.
 


 Gradient boosting relies on regression trees (even when solving a classification problem) which minimize
 *mean squared error* (MSE).
 Selecting a prediction for a leaf region is simple: to minimize MSE we should select an average target
 value over samples in the leaf.
 The tree is built greedily starting from the root: for each leaf a split is selected to minimize MSE for
 this step.
 


 The greediness of this process allows it to build trees quite fast, but it produces suboptimal results.
 Building an optimal tree turns out to be a very hard (NP-complete, actually) problem.
 


 At the same time these built trees do their job (better than people typically think)
 and fit well for our next step.
 

## Gradient Boosting Visualized


 This demo shows the result of combining 100 decision trees.

 Not bad, right?
 As we see, gradient boosting is able to provide smooth detailed predictions by combining many trees of very
 limited depth (cf. with the single decision tree above!).
 

## Explanation: what is gradient boosting?



 To begin with, gradient boosting is an ensembling technique, which means that prediction is done by an
 ensemble
 of simpler estimators.
 While this theoretical framework makes it possible to create an ensemble of various estimators, in practice
 we almost
 always use GBDT — gradient boosting over decision trees.
 This is the case I cover in the demo, but in principle any other estimator could be used instead of a
 decision tree.
 


 The aim of gradient boosting is to create (or "train") an ensemble of trees, given that we know how to
 train a single decision tree.
 This technique is called **boosting** because we expect an ensemble to work much better than
 a single estimator.
 

## How an Ensemble Is Built


 Here comes the most interesting part.
 Gradient boosting builds an ensemble of trees **one-by-one**,
 then the predictions of the individual trees **are summed**:
 $$
 D(\mathbf{x}) = d_\text{tree 1}(\mathbf{x}) + d_\text{tree 2}(\mathbf{x}) + ...
 $$
 


 The next decision tree tries to cover the discrepancy between the target function \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) and the current
 ensemble prediction **by reconstructing the residual**.
 


 For example, if an ensemble has 3 trees the prediction of that ensemble is:
 $$
 D(\mathbf{x}) = d_\text{tree 1}(\mathbf{x}) + d_\text{tree 2}(\mathbf{x}) + d_\text{tree 3}(\mathbf{x})
 $$

 The next tree ( \( \text{tree 4} \) ) in the ensemble should complement well the existing trees and minimize
 the training error of the ensemble. In the ideal case we'd be happy to have:
 $$
 D(\mathbf{x}) + d_\text{tree 4}(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}).
 $$
 


 To get a bit closer to the destination, we train a tree to reconstruct the difference between the
 target function and the current predictions of an ensemble, which is called the **residual**:
 $$
 R(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}) - D(\mathbf{x}).
 $$
 Did you notice? If decision tree completely reconstructs \( R(\mathbf{x}) \),
 the whole ensemble gives predictions without errors (after adding the
 newly-trained
 tree to the ensemble)!
 That said, in practice this never happens, so we instead continue the iterative process of ensemble building.
 

target function \( f(\mathbf{x}) \)
 and prediction of previous trees \( D(\mathbf{x}) \)
 




residual \( R(\mathbf{x}) \) and
 prediction
 of next tree \( d_n(\mathbf{x}) \)
 







 Look at the plot on the right. pay attention to how the values on the vertical (y) axis decrease after many trees have been built (and the residual
 becomes smaller and smaller). After playing with this residuals demo you may notice some interesting things:


- before a tree is added to an ensemble, it's predictions are multiplied by some factor

this factor (called \( \eta \) or learning rate) is an important parameter of GB ( \( \eta = 0.3 \) in this
 demo)
 
if we set number of trees to 10 and vary the depth: we notice that as the depth gets higher, the residual gets smaller, but it's also more
 noisy
 

 discontinuities ('spikes') appear at those points where a decision tree split
 

 the larger the learning rate — the larger the 'step' made by a single decision tree
 — and the larger the discontinuity
 

 in practice GBDT is used with small learning rate ( \( 0.01 < \eta < 0.1 \) ) and large number of trees
 to get the best results
 

## Gradient Boosting for Classification Problem


 Things become more interesting when we want to build an ensemble for classification.
 


 A naive approach that covers the difference between 'where we are' and 'where we want to get' doesn't seem to work anymore,
 and things become more interesting.
 


 But that's a topic for another post.
