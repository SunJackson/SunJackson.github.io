People use R for lots of reasons: “It’s great for the models I need”, “I
like the functional approach”, “It’s the tool I’m most comfortable
with”.

People don’t use R for these reasons: “I have a favourite processor
core, I don’t want to use the others”, “I love how my memory needs to
fit all my data”.

What if I told you that you didn’t need to worry about that any more?

## Multi-threaded R

Microsoft have their own version of `R` called Microsoft R
Client.
It has a bunch of high-tech, whiz-bang features, but we’re going to
focus on one: multi-threading calculations. Vanilla `R` is single
threaded.This means any calculations are done sequentially, in order,
one at a time. However, this isn’t using the ability of most modern,
domestic laptops. To get setup with Microsoft R Client, follow the
install
instructions.
Once you’ve got Microsoft R Client installed, you will need to make sure
it’s the version of `R` that is active in your session. If you are using
RStudio this is easy to do by going to
`Tools > Global Options > General > R Version`.

You will probably be asked to Restart R Studio, so close it and open
back up, then we can run the code.

This message will pop up, and it’s worth noting as it’s got some
information in it that you might need to think about:

It’s worth noting that right now Microsoft r Client is lagging
behind the current `R` version, and is based on version 3.4 of `R`,
not 3.5. This will mean your default package libraries will not be
shared between the installations if you are running `R` 3.5.
It’s using a snapshot of `CRAN` called `MRAN` to source packages by
default. 90% of the time it will operate just as you expect, but
because it takes a ‘snapshot’ of packages, newer features and
changes that have hit `CRAN` may not be in the version of the
package you are grabbing.


`RevoScaleR` and probably the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages
will likely be installed for you already as default in Microsoft
R Client. The other two you will probably have to install
yourself.

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(microbenchmark)
library(RevoScaleR)
library(ggplot2)
library(lockeutils)
theme_set(theme_ld() + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -1)))
library(dplyr)

```

### Test Data

Here we make a set of example data, 3 data frame of random numbers with
various ‘normal’ distributions. The data frames are of different
lengths: 500,000 , 1,000,000 and 5,000,000.

```
set.seed(9000)
sample_df = function(n){
 data.frame(
 col_1 = c(rnorm(n, mean = 11, sd = 0.5)), 
 col_2 = c(rnorm(n, mean = 6, sd = 1)), 
 col_3 = c(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 0.75))
 )
}

df_500k <- sample_df(500000)
df_1m <- sample_df(1000000)
df_5m <- sample_df(5000000)

```

### Benchmarking

Running benchmarks in `R` is easy with the microbenchmark package. The
package tries to be as accurate as possible in measuring the time for
each of it’s runs, and also allows you to easily compare different
approaches and specify the amount of repeats. I’ve decided to test each
of the 3 data sets in each of 2 different linear modelling functions,
giving 6 different groups of results. Each group will be run 10 times
for a total set of 60 runs.

```
res <- microbenchmark(
 lm_50k = lm(col_1 ~ col_2 + col_3, data = df_500k),
 rxLM_50k = rxLinMod(col_1 ~ col_2 + col_3, data = df_500k, reportProgress = 0),
 lm_1m = lm(col_1 ~ col_2 + col_3, data = df_1m),
 rxLM_1m = rxLinMod(col_1 ~ col_2 + col_3, data = df_1m, reportProgress = 0),
 lm_5m = lm(col_1 ~ col_2 + col_3, data = df_5m),
 rxLM_5m = rxLinMod(col_1 ~ col_2 + col_3, data = df_5m, reportProgress = 0),
 times = 10
 )

```

### Results

The `res` object is of class `microbenchmark`, and has a plotting method
that can be used via `ggplot2::autoplot()`.

```
autoplot(res) + 
 labs(title = "Violin plot of model run durations", 
 subtitle = "`rxLinMod()` vs `lm()`",
 caption = "Microsoft R Client 3.4.3, 2 cores")

```

![](https://itsalocke.com/blog/img/plot-1.png)


In each of these tests, we can see that the `RevoScaleR::rxLinMod()`
functions outperforms the base `lm()` by a large margin. Note the log
scale for `Time [milliseconds]`!

```
knitr::kable(summary(res))

```

### But how?

It does this because the *Microsoft R Client* uses Intel MKL for
parallel mathematical computing. This allows the `RevoScaleR` package
to implement a ‘parallelised algorithm’ to solve the linear regression
using the BLAS and LAPACK FORTRAN libraries. More technical details are
avilable in the
docs.

## What about the out of memory part?

`RevoScaleR` and Microsoft R Client can help with that, though the
solution requires a little more involvement. The short version is that
it can leverage *distributed data sources* as a backend, such as spark,
hadoop and sqlserver. this allows the data to be spread across many
*compute nodes* that are managed by software called ‘Microsoft Machine
Learning Server`. This is a good overview of the
ideas
on the main site, which also holds all the documentation.

## Would you like to know more?

Locke Data have are developing course going into depth with this
technology from an `R` context and are releasing it at the end of
October. Please come and join us
(virtually!) for some hands-on learning and detailed tutorials.
