 Stop jumping between applications. Mode Studio connects a SQL editor, Python and R notebooks, and a visualization builder in one platform.
 



**Explore with SQL, Python, or R**Analysis requires multiple tools. SQL is ideal for some applications, while R and Python are better in others. Mode lets you use the language that best suits the job, without jumping between applications.
 



**Build custom visualizations, or use our built-in charts**Mode has built-in charts to create reports and dashboards in seconds. Use the tool that's most comfortable: D3, ggplot, matplotlib, or Mode's drag-and-drop charting tools to explore data and communicate what you've found.
 



**Share with a click**When you're done with your analysis (or even if you're not done), simply grab the URL and send it out to collaborators and viewers. Your analysis lives on forever at a URL, and viewers can refresh without bothering you.
