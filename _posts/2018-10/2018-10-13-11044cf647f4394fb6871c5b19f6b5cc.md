Its been a while since I write a CRAN package and this weekend I decidedto work on a idea I had some time ago. The result is package`PkgsFromFiles`.

When working with different computers at home or work, one of theproblems I have is installing missing packages across differentcomputers. As an example, a script that works in my **work computer** maynot work in my **home computer**. This is specially annoying when I have afresh install of the operating system or R. In this case, I mustmanually install all packages, case by case. Instead of focusing on thescript at hand, I spend considerable time finding and installing missingpackages. When using laptops for teaching R, many times I had to waitfor the installation of a package before continuing the class. With mynew package, PkgsFromFiles, I can scan any folder of my computer andinstall all necessary packages **before** using them, as we will soonlearn.

One of the available solutions to this problem is to use packagepacman. It includesfunction `p_load` that will check if a package is available and, if not,install it from CRAN. However, for me, I like using `library` and`require` as it is consistent with my code format. Also, in a fresh Rinstall, I rather install all my required packages in a single run sothat I don’t have to wait later.

Package PkgsFromFiles solves this issue by finding and parsing all Rrelated files (.R, .Rmd, .Rnw) from a given folder. It finds all callsto library() and require() and installs all packages that are notavailable locally.

```
# from cran (soon!)
install.packages('PkgsFromFiles')

# from github
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('msperlin/PkgsFromFiles')

```

The main function of the package is `pff_find_and_install_pkgs`, whichwill search and install missing packages from R files at a givendirectory. As an example, we’ll use my research folder from Dropbox. Itcontains all R script I have ever used in my research work. Let’s try itout:

```
# Evaluation is disable so it passes CRAN CHECKS, but you should be able to run it in your computer
library(PkgsFromFiles)

# target folder
my.dir <- '~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/'

df <- pff_find_and_install_pkgs(folder.in = my.dir)

```

As you can see, function `pff_find_and_install_pkgs` will find all Rrelated files recursively in the given folder. In this case, I have allpackages locally so no installation was required. A summary in text isshown at the end of execution.

The output of the function is a dataframe with the details of theoperation. Have a look:

```
dplyr::glimpse(df)

## Observations: 127
## Variables: 3
## $ pkg "dplyr", "stringr", "GetDFPData", "xlsx", "goog...
## $ status.message "Already installed", "Already installed", "Alre...
## $ installation TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,...

```

The package also includes function `pff_find_R_files_from_folder`, whichwill find all packages used in R related files from a given folder. Itoutputs a dataframe with several information about packages used in thefound scripts.

```
df.files <- pff_find_R_files_from_folder(folder.in = my.dir)

## 
## Searching folder ~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/
## Found 32 files in 11 folders
## R Scripts: 32 files
## Rmarkdown files: 0 files
## Sweave files: 0 files

dplyr::glimpse(df.files)

## Observations: 32
## Variables: 5
## $ files "/home/msperlin/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa//01-Working Pap...
## $ file.names "01-Build_Presidents_Table.R", "02-DownloadPictures...
## $ extensions "R", "R", "R", "R", "R", "R", "R", "R", "R", "R", "...
## $ pkgs "dplyr ; stringr ; GetDFPData ; xlsx", "googlesheet...
## $ n.pkgs 4, 4, 1, 3, 6, 6, 2, 4, 3, 6, 9, 6, 8, 5, 4, 1, 9, ...

```

I also wrote a simple function for plotting the most used packages for agiven folder:

```
# target folder
my.dir <- '~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/'

# plot most used pkgs
p <- pff_plot_summary_pkgs(folder.in = my.dir)

## 
## Searching folder ~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/
## Found 32 files in 11 folders
## R Scripts: 32 files
## Rmarkdown files: 0 files
## Sweave files: 0 files

print(p)

```

As you can see, I’m a big fan of the `tidyverse`!

Hope you guys find the package useful! Fell free to send any question tothe comment section of the post or my email ([email protected]).
