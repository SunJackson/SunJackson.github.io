What was the largest dataset you analyzed / data mined?


This poll received 1108 votes, about 10% less than in 2016, but still a large enough sample. 
The results again show a surprising stability, fitting a pattern that emerged already in 2012, with a majority of data scientists and analysts working with data in Gigabytes range, and a small, but notable segment working with web-scale data of over 100 Petabytes.


Note that the poll asks about the 
**largest** ever dataset, so a typical dataset analyzed is expected to be significantly smaller.


Highlights:

 **Gigabytes still rule: ** Majority of answers (56% in 2018, 57% in 2016, 56% in 2015, 54% in 2014, 53% in 2013) are in Gigabyte range. The overall median response was again between 11 and 100 GB (which comfortably fits on one laptop) for each year since 2012.
 **Consistency**: the shape of the curve each year is almost the same. Although in 2018 there were fewer responses in under 10MB range, and more in 1-10GB range, bit not significantly so.
 **Petabyte Big Data Scientists still stand apart**: There is a small but significant gap, with almost no answers in 1-10 PB range, which separates analysts who work with Terabyte-size commercial data warehouses and those who work with 100+ petabyte web-scale data stores. See for example a recent story on current Uber data warehouse of 100PB.
 **Academic researchers on par with Government, Industry**: The estimated median for academic researchers is 90GB, on par with Government (60 GB) and Industry analysts (50 GB). The estimated median answer has increased a little for all segments in 2018.

2018 data is shown as a column, to stand apart from lines for previous years.


This poll also asked about employment type, and the breakdown was 

 Company or Self-Employed, 62% (was also 62% in 2016) 
 Student, 17% (was 20% in 2016)
 Academia/University, 13% (was 10% in 2016)
 Government/non-profit, 4.8% (was 5.1% in 2016)
 Other, 3.2% (was 2.4% in 2016)

Circle size corresponds to the number of responses.


Regional trends show a little more voters from Latin America, Middle East, and Australia, and a little less from US. The numbers were:

 Europe, 34.9% (was 35.1%)
 US/Canada, 34.4% (was 36.9% in 2016)
 Asia, 15.6% (was 17%)
 Latin America, 6.9% (was 5.6%)
 Africa/Middle East, 4.9% (was 3.2%)
 Australia/NZ, 3.2% (was 2.3%)

Finally, we examine the largest dataset analyzed by both employment and region for 3 largest regions.

We got more responses from Asian "Company" Data Scientists for 100PB data than from US/Canada or Europe Data Scientist. We see a similar situation with Asian students.
