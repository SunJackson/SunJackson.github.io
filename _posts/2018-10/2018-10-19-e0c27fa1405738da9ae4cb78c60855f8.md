So the NYT yesterday has a story about this study I am directed to it and am immediately concerned about all the things that make this study somewhat dubious. Forking paths in the definition of the independent variable, sample selection in who wore the accelerometers, ignorance of the undoubtedly huge importance of interactions in the controls, etc, etc. blah blah blah. But I am astonished at the bald statement at the start of the study: “The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.” Why shouldn’t everyone, including the NYT, stop reading right there? How does a journal accept the article? The dataset itself is public and they didn’t create it! They’re just saying Fuck You.

The Journal of the American Heart Association published this? And the New York Times promoted it?

As a heart patient myself, I’m annoyed. I’d give it a subliminal frowny face, but I don’t want to go affecting your views on immigration.

By the way, I started Who is Rich? this week and it’s great.
