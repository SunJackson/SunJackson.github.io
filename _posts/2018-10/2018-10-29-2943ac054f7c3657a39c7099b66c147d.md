A new R package called **crfsuite** supported by BNOSAC landed safely on CRAN last week. The crfsuite package (https://github.com/bnosac/crfsuite) is an R package specific to Natural Language Processing and allows you to easily build and apply models for

- **named entity recognition**

- **text chunking**

- **part of speech tagging**

- **intent recognition or**

- **classification of any category you have in mind**


The focus of the implementation is on allowing the R user to build such models **on his/her own data, with your own categories**. The R package is a Rcpp interface to the popular crfsuite C++ package which is used a lot in all kinds of chatbots.

In order to facilitate creating training data on your own data, a shiny app is made available in this R package which allows you to easily tag your own chunks of text, with your own categories, which can next be used to build a crfsuite model. The package also plays nicely together with the udpipe R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=udpipe), which you need in order to extract predictive features (e.g. parts of speech tags) for your words to be used in the crfsuite model.

On a side-note. If you are in the area of NLP, you might also be interested in the upcoming ruimtehol R package which is a wrapper around the excellent StarSpace C++ code providing word/sentence/document embeddings, text-based classification, content-based recommendation and similarities as well as entity relationship completion.

You can get going with the crfsuite package as follows. Have a look at the package vignette, it shows you how to construct and apply your own crfsuite model.
