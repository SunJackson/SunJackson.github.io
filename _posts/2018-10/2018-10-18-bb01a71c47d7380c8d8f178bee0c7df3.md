### GraphConnect 2018

 GraphConnect 2018, Neo4jâ€™s bi-annual conference, was held in New York City in mid-September. It took place right in mid-town Manhattan at the beautiful Marriott Marquis Times Square. I had the opportunity to attend some parts of the conference.

This was the schedule of events:

Keynotes and Sessions (Thursday)
Training Sessions (Friday)
Ecosystem Summit (Friday)
Community Hackathon (Saturday)

 

### History of GraphConnect

 The first GraphConnect conference was held in 2012. It is worth noting the community and user growth of Neo4j. I spoke to a participant who attended the first conference 6 years prior who shared that back then about 50 to 100 people attended. This year, over 1000 people attended.

 

### About Neo4j

 Neo4j efficiency is derived in using â€œpointersâ€� to connect data, rather than â€œindices.â€� Traditional tabular datasets may contain â€œsparse matricesâ€� if not all relationships between entities exist which slows down performance and is not optimally efficient.

Neo4j is open-sourced. There is a Community Edition that is available for free and also an Enterprise Edition which is available under a commercial license.

 

### Conference

 Neo4j founder Emil Eifrem and iconic data scientist Hilary Mason both delivered fantastic keynotes. Video recordings are publicly available for viewing *all* the keynote talks (about 90 minutes in duration).


 

### Conference Highlights / Key Takeaways from Emil Eifrem

 **Seeing our Data as Networks**


**NoSQL is Resource Intensive / Graphs are Efficient**


**Popularity of Graphs**





**Healthcare Application**


 

### Hilary Mason

 





 

### Trainings

 Thirteen different training sessions were offered as a separate conference event. Topics included modeling, development, data science and analysis for people at all levels of Neo4j experience:

New to Graphs

Neo4j Basics
New Features in Neo4j

Data Scientists and BI/Analysts

Graph Algorithms
Data Science and ML
Discovery and Visualization with Bloom

Architects, DBAs, and Data Modelers

Intro to Graph Modelling
Graph Modelling Clinic

Developers

Python web app development
Building apps on the GRANDstack
Modeling for Developers (refactoring, evolving, hands-on Cypher)
Cypher Tuning & Performance
APOC Extensions for Analytics and Operations
Graph-Based Natural Language Understanding





 

### Ecosystem Summit

 This was a private event to bring together the top Neo4j open source contributors, influencers and inspirational community leaders. Discussions were held in a smaller room. It was an intimate and casual discussion with Neo4j executives.






 

### Hackathon

 On Saturday, September 22, there was a free community event, called Neo4j Buzzword Bingo Hackathon, which was a hackathon using the open-source software. Over 120 tech lovers attended this event which was hosted at Stack Overflow.
