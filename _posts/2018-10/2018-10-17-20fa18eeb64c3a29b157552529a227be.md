**Who is Mindstrong?**

We are a passionate and entrepreneurial team of people with unrivaled experience and background in science, technology and healthcare.

Our mission is to transform brain health through measurement science.

Brain health is fundamental to our mental health and overall health. Mindstrong has developed and validated the first ever passive, continuous measures of brain function using patterns generated from touchscreen interactions on your smartphone. These data reflect the way your brain processes and responds to the world around you. 

While weight, blood glucose or blood pressure are familiar objective measures of diabetes and heart disease, progress in mental health has been limited by the lack of similar objective and ecological measures. Mindstrong’s scientifically validated digital biomarkers of brain function are objective, ecological, and proving essential in detecting and managing mental illness early. The ability to detect deterioration of brain health enables the timely delivery of interventions, when they are most effective. Measuring brain health, and delivery of smarter care, results in better long-term mental health.

We are looking for people who are passionate about our mission, committed to excellence and excited to build a company that will address one of the greatest health challenges of our time.
