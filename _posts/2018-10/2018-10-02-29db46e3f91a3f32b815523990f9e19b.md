If you use Python* for HPC, data analytics, or data science, you love the productivity features and the large ecosystem of packages available to quickly build applications. However, getting faster performance from Python that’s close to native code is difficult, requiring software development expertise and tremendous patience.



Well, good news! Intel provides optimized Scikit-learn, the most used Python package for classical machine learning. Get optimizations in Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Means, with Intel® DAAL for great performance speedups compared to unaccelerated open source scikit-learn. Get faster scikit-learn through Intel® Distribution for Python*


Faster machine learning with scikit-learn key algorithms accelerated with Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library
The latest TensorFlow* and Caffe* libraries optimized for Intel® architecture
The XGBoost package included in the Intel® Distribution for Python (Linux* only)
