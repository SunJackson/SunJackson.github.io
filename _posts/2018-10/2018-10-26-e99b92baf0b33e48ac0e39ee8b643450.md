What if we lived in a society where everyone really happy about living in a diverse neighborhood? What if people only wanted to move when the disparity was really extreme: say, when fewer than 33% of people nearby looked like them? Well, we'd end up with a society like this:

Still pretty segregated, as it turns out. At Parable of The Polygons (via Miles McBain), an interesting interactive website, you can experiment with the levels of individual bias that lead the eponymous Polygons to switch locations, and see the impact on the overall Polygon society. It's quite enlightening.

That's all from us at the blog for this week. Have a great weekend, and we'll be back next week.
