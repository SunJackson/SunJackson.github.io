**Factorized Adversarial Network (FAN)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we propose Factorized Adversarial Networks (FAN) to solve unsupervised domain adaptation problems for image classification tasks. Our networks map the data distribution into a latent feature space, which is factorized into a domain-specific subspace that contains domain-specific characteristics and a task-specific subspace that retains category information, for both source and target domains, respectively. Unsupervised domain adaptation is achieved by adversarial training to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of two task-specific subspaces from source and target domains. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets used in the literature for unsupervised domain adaptation. Furthermore, we collect two real-world tagging datasets that are much larger than existing benchmark datasets, and get significant improvement upon baselines, proving the practical value of our approach. … 

**Reinforced Continual Learning** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Most artificial intelligence models have limiting ability to solve new tasks faster, without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The recently emerging paradigm of continual learning aims to solve this issue, in which the model learns various tasks in a sequential fashion. In this work, a novel approach for continual learning is proposed, which searches for the best neural architecture for each coming task via sophisticatedly designed reinforcement learning strategies. We name it as Reinforced Continual Learning. Our method not only has good performance on preventing catastrophic forgetting but also fits new tasks well. The experiments on sequential classification tasks for variants of MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing continual learning alternatives for deep networks. … 

**Reliability Modelling** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Reliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the reliability of a component or system prior to its implementation. Two types of analysis that are often used to model a complete system’s availability behavior (including effects from logistics issues like spare part provisioning, transport and manpower) are Fault Tree Analysis and reliability block diagrams. At a component level, the same types of analyses can be used together with others. The input for the models can come from many sources including testing; prior operational experience; field data; as well as data handbooks from similar or related industries. Regardless of source, all model input data must be used with great caution, as predictions are only valid in cases where the same product was used in the same context. As such, predictions are often only used to help compare alternatives. …
