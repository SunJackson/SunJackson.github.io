##  About me

I am a MBA graduate with major in Marketing & for my entire life, I have stayed away from coding; I ran from it as far as I can.Well,Who knew Life had another plans for me.

##  Why I wanted to learn Data Science & Visualization

I always wanted to learn smart tools which make our jobs easier, sadly most of the people in and around fancy business schools are still hooked onto SPSS/Excel/powerpoint for some reason, probably because the teachers who teach there were more familiar with those tools. However, I was always intrigued with this idea that why hasn't any great business tools made headway and still everyone uses Excel for normal task

##  How I approached learning Data Science & Visualization

This curiosity helped me learn about R & Tableau, both the tools who I now have grown accustomed to; my day is not complete if I don't use these tools for any work/personal related task. (I use them more on weekends or my day off ![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f603.png)
 )

##  Challenges I faced

The main challenge which I faced was that being a Management student, there was no one in or around me who were actively looking to learn or even heard of R. I was mostly treated as some researcher who is trying to act crazy by spending countless hours trying to learn something which I will not be using. However, my wil was not broken and I continued to learn from internet & books and finally became an expert.

##  Key takeaways

Key takeaways are that if you find yourself being interested in any area just pursue it even though the world around does not support or finds you crazy to do something which will never be required

##  Tips and advice

My advice to new students who are in non-technical fields such as MBA is that it always adds to value to learn new tools not only does that set you apart but also builds tangible skills which will definitely help you ahead (even though everyone around you says it will not)

##  Final thoughts and next steps

Coming from a non-technical background to now being an expert in data science, my love for the field only keeps growing. I love teaching & mentoring new students who like me are intimidated by coding languages; to make them forget the fear of coding & make them fall in love with data science is the most satisfying job.

TLDR;Now, I play Cupid & making students (especially non technical background) fall in love with Data Science is my job ![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f603.png)
