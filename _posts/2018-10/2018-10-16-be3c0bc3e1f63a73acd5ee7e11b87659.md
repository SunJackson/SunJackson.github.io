Numerical algorithms are computationally demanding, which makes performance an important consideration when using Python for machine learning, especially as you move from desktop to production.

Join ***Sergey Maidanov, Software Engineering Manager at Intel*** and ***Tom Radcliffe, VP Engineering at ActiveState*** as they look at:

- Role of productivity and performance for numerical computing and machine learning

- Python algorithm choice and efficient package usage

- Requirements for efficient use of hardware

- NumPy and SciPy performance with the Intel MKL (math kernel library)

- How Intel and ActivePython help you accelerate and scale Python performance
