*Full many a gem of purest ray serene,The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air.*

It is finally here! **cricpy**, the python avatar , of my R package **cricketr** is now ready to rock-n-roll! My R package cricketr had its genesis about 3 and some years ago and went through a couple of enhancements. During this time I have always thought about creating an equivalent python package like cricketr. Now I have finally done it.

So here it is. My python package **‘cricpy!!!’**

This package uses the statistics info available in ESPN Cricinfo Statsguru. The current version of this package supports only Test cricket

You should be able to install the package using **pip install cricpy** and use the many functions available in the package. Please mindful of the ESPN Cricinfo Terms of Use

This post is also hosted on Rpubs at Introducing cricpy. You can also download the pdf version of this post at cricpy.pdf

## 9 . Highest Runs Likelihood

The plot below shows the Runs Likelihood for a batsman. For this the performance of Sachin is plotted as a 3D scatter plot with Runs versus Balls Faced + Minutes at crease. K-Means. The centroids of 3 clusters are computed and plotted. In this plot Dravid’s  highest tendencies are computed and plotted using K-Means

```
import cricpy.analytics as ca
ca.batsmanRunsLikelihood("../dravid.csv","Rahul Dravid")
```

## 10. A look at the Top 4 batsman – Rahul Dravid, Alastair Cook, Brian Lara and Virat Kohli
