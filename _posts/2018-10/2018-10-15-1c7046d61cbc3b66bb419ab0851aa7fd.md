From the smartphones in our back pockets to advances in the healthcare industry, technology’s effect on our lives is undeniable. The potential uses of technology seem endless, especially for healthcare professionals. One area demonstrating these ever-growing possibilities is artificial intelligence (AI). AI has the potential to drastically change the healthcare industry, from simplifying administrative tasks to more involved medical uses like improving early diagnosis.

## Data processing and optimizing administration

Whether it’s general information or specialized test results, healthcare providers need to process and organize large amounts of information on a daily basis. According to a 2017 study

AI has the potential to drastically reduce this time by making EHRs and other documents and processes more efficient. For example, [](“https://healthitanalytics.com/features/ehr-users-want-their-time-back-and-artificial-intelligence-can-help”)AI could replace outdated office fixtures

Ideally, these changes will improve workflow, increase information accessibility, and give time back to providers. But how could these technological changes and “virtual assistants” help medical professionals in the examination room? And how can patients benefit from this new assistance?

## From image analysis to aiding diagnosis

AI has the power to influence how providers and patients interact with healthcare. Previously, AI has effectively performed [](“https://www.ajronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2214/AJR.11.7522”)image analysis

One healthcare organization in Iowa has even relied on [](“https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/university-iowa-healthcare-rolls-out-first-autonomous-ai-diagnostic-system-cleared-fda”)“the first autonomous artificial intelligence diagnostic system”

## What AI could mean for early diagnosis

While it’s unlikely that AI will ever replace human physicians entirely, it is possible for AI to affect patient survival rates because of how the technology could influence the process of diagnosis. Researchers have already suggested that AI could have a [](“https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42357257”)a major impact on patient prognosis

For example, an early cancer diagnosis can be invaluable because early detection may drastically impact the care available for patients diagnosed with rarer forms of cancer. This is especially true for [](“https://www.maacenter.org/mesothelioma/“)cancers with long latency periods, such as mesothelioma

## So what does AI mean for healthcare?

Though automation and optimization are useful, AI is unique because it is designed to mimic the human brain rather than relying on pre-fabricated algorithms. This is one of the major reasons AI could have a huge impact on the healthcare industry. Its ability to let machines “learn” could make it possible for technology to contribute in distinctly different ways from previous uses in the healthcare industry.

While AI can make certain administrative tasks easier, the role it could play in aiding clinical diagnosis has the potential to bring valuable insights to providers and patients. Whether it is an earlier or more accurate diagnosis, AI could help ensure patients are treated more effectively and efficiently.
