“Data science is a component of many sciences, including the health and social sciences. Therefore, the tasks of data science are the tasks of those sciences – description, prediction, causal inference. A sometimes overlooked point is that a successful data science requires not only good data and algorithms, but also domain knowledge (including causal knowledge) from its parent sciences.” Miguel A. Hernán, John Hsu, Brian Healy ( July 12, 2018 )
