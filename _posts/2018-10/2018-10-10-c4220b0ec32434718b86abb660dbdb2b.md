Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. The service does the following for you:

- Identifies the language of the text.

- Extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or locations.

- Understands how positive or negative the text is.

- Analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech.

- Automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic.


In today’s global marketplace, many companies require the ability to engage with their customers in a variety of languages, and Amazon Comprehend makes it easy to analyze those interactions. Today, we are pleased to announce that Amazon Comprehend supports four additional languages: French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. AWS customers can now analyze feedback and articles, and they can even organize information with native support for these languages.

Starting today, the service is also available in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) Region. We also recently announced availability in the Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. Amazon Comprehend continues to expand its regional availability enabling more AWS customers to analyze text in their native language, co-located with their data. To view an entire list of available Regions in which Amazon Comprehend is available, see our Region Table.

To get started, Comprehend provides a simple, no-code portal that allows customers to easily try the APIs with their own text, and now in additional languages. The following example shows the analysis of text containing named entities, in Italian, in the Amazon Comprehend console:

Amazon Comprehend provides synchronous and asynchronous APIs that allow you to analyze text based on the use cases that are best for your application. The following example shows a CLI call analyzing Italian text for the named entities:
