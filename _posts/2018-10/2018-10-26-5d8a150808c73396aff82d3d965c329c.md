 No more jumping between applications. Mode Studio combines a SQL editor, Python and R notebooks, and a visualization builder in one platform.
 



**Go from SQL query to Python or R Notebooks**Connect your data to Mode, explore in our SQL editor, and pass results to integrated Python or R notebooks for deeper exploration and visualization.
 



**Build custom visualizations, or use our built-in charts**Add visualizations with the tool that's most comfortable. Use D3, ggplot, matplotlib, or Mode's drag-and-drop charting tools to explore data and communicate what you've found.
 



**Share analysis with a click**When you're done with your analysis (or even if you're not done), simply grab the URL and send it out to collaborators and viewers. Your analysis lives on forever at a URL, and viewers can refresh without bothering you.
