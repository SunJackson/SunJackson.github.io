Check this out! RStudio now has special features for Stan:

> 
– Improved, context-aware autocompletion for Stan files and chunks
– A document outline, which allows for easy navigation between Stan code blocks
– Inline diagnostics, which help to find issues while you develop your Stan model
– The ability to interrupt Stan parallel workers launched within the IDE


This is awesome—especially that last feature. Rstudio is my hero.

And don’t forget this: If you don’t currently have Stan on your computer, you can play with this demo version on the web, thanks to RStudio Cloud.
