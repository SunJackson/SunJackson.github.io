According to a KDD poll *fewer* respondents (by rate) used *only* `R` in 2017 than in 2018. At the same time more respondents (by rate) used only `Python` in 2017 than in 2016.

Let’s take this as an excuse to take a quick look at what happens when we try a task in both systems.




For our task we picked the painful exercise of directly reading a 50,000,000 row by 50 column data set into memory on a machine with only 8GB of ram.

In `Python` the `Pandas` package takes around 6 minutes to read the data, and then one is ready to work.

In `R` both `utils::read.csv()` and `readr::read_csv()` fail with out of memory messages. So if your view of `R` is “`base R` only”, or “`base R` plus `tidyverse` only”, or “`tidyverse` only”: reading this file is a “hard task.”

With the above narrow view one would have no choice but to move to `Python` if one wants to get the job done.

Or, we could remember `data.table`. While `data.table` is obviously not part of the `tidyverse`, `data.table` has been a best-practice in `R` for around 12 years. It can read the data and is ready to work in `R` in under a minute.

In conclusion, to get things done in a pinch: learn `Python` or learn `data.table`. And, in my opinion, “`tidyverse` first teaching” (commonly code for “`tidyverse` only teaching”) may not serve the `R` community well in the long run.
