It’s been a while since I shared any information about the R Consortium’s Census Working Group.

Today I’d like to share an update on three projects which the group is involved in.

The project which you might already be familiar with is the “Guide to Working with Census Data in R”. This is my survey paper that will include popular datasets that Census publishes, R packages that facilitate working with Census Data and resources to learn more about the above. I am planning to complete this document in the next two weeks.

The project which launched this working group is my video course on using Choroplethr to visualize data from the American Community Survey (ACS). This course will be free and hosted on the Census Bureau’s website. The course has already been completed, and we’re in the final stages of getting approval from the bureau to publish the course on its website. I expect this to be completed by the end of the year.

A new project which we are considering taking on is a webinar series highlighting authors of R packages that work with Census data. This would give us a chance to create a library of educational material about using R to work with Census data.

If you have any questions or feedback about this, please contact me.
