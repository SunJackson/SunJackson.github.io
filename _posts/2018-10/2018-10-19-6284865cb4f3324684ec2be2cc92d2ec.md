In 2016, 2.1 million Americans were found to have an opioid use disorder (according to SAMHSA), with drug overdose now the leading cause of injury and death in the United States. But some of the country’s top minds are working to fight this epidemic, and statisticians are helping to lead the charge. 

In* **This* is Statistics’ second annual fall data challenge, high school and undergraduate students will use statistics to analyze data and develop recommendations to help address this important public health crisis. 

The contest invites teams of two to five students to put their statistical and data visualization skills to work using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Multiple Cause of Death (Detailed Mortality) data set, and contribute to creating healthier communities. Given the size and complexity of the CDC dataset, programming languages such as R can be used to manipulate and conduct analysis effectively.

Each submission will consist of a short essay and presentation of recommendations. Winners will be awarded for best overall analysis, best visualization and best use of external data. Submissions are due November 12, 2018.
