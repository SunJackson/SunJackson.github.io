DataFest is a festival of data innovation run by The Data Lab every March since 2017. DataFest caters to a broad range of audiences and consists of a variety of events across Scotland, including: an international conference (Data Summit), a recruiting event (Data Talent), and over 45 ‘fringe’ events (data workshops and trainings) organised by local partners. In 2019, DataFest will become the UK’s first two-week festival of Data Innovation, taking place between **11****th**** - 22****nd**** March 2019**. 

This year, we are delighted to introduce a new event to the DataFest family: DataTech. DataTech19 will bring together analysts, developers, engineers and scientists from the public sector, academia and industry for technical presentations and discussions of important topics in data science, to share technical expertise, and to engage in networking and collaboration. The conference will also serve as a forum to share emerging research in data science.

DataTech19 will take place on **14****th**** March in Edinburgh, at the National Museum of Scotland (tickets ****here****)**. We are welcoming attendees and presenters from a variety of backgrounds and invite submissions and case studies on a variety of topics, such as:

Scaling algorithms, software and hardware to cope with large amounts of data (including data reduction, code optimisation, use of GPUs, cloud and high-performance computing, etc.)
Machine learning, modelling techniques, and model selection and validation
Data exploration: visualisation techniques / tools and query facilities
Scientific workflows and data frameworks for data collection, storage, cleaning, modelling and result interpretation: approaches and best practices
Reproducible and collaborative data science (including sub-themes such as open data, code maintainability, code smells etc.)
Robust estimation methods for problematic real-world data
Web / phone applications and resulting data
Deep learning
Applications of analysing various types of data: numeric, text, image, sound and video (e.g., Internet of Things, traffic monitoring etc.)
Challenges in causal inference

Other topics will also be considered. We also encourage submissions with the potential to bridge multiple topics of wide interest, so please visit https://www.datafest.global/data-tech for further details on how to **submit a proposal to present at DataTech19**.

We look forward to welcoming you in Edinburgh in March 2019! **Book your ticket ****here****.**
