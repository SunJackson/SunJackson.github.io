Recently, I was reading Howard *et. al.,* (2018) â€œ**Genome-wide meta-analysis of depression in 807,553 individuals identifies 102 independent variants with replication in a further 1,507,153 individuals**â€� and saw a really cool 3D visualization of highlighted brain regions associated with depression:

After an exhaustive search I couldnâ€™t find any reference to how this was done in the methods or supplementary information so I reached out to the authors. While I was awaiting a response, I also reached out to the Twitterverse to see if anyone knew of tools which could be used to create such a visualization.

Helmet Karim suggested that perhaps these images were created using BrainNet Viewer in MATLABso this was the first method I tried out.

*Note*: All of the methods covered in this article use what is called a brain Atlas overlayed as a maskon a normalized T1 MRI image. Iâ€™ve chosen to highlight the left hippocampus across these methods so that they are comparable.

### BrainNet Viewer

First follow the install instructions for BrainNet Viewer here then start the graphical user interface (GUI) up from the terminal.

Next select load file and choose a surface template surface template and a mapping file (*i.e.* a brain atlas). The package provides samples so I chose BrainMesh_ICBMI52_smoothed.nv and the [AAL90](http://neuro.imm.dtu.dk/wiki/Automated_Anatomical_Labeling) brain atlas which has labeled volumes for 90 brain regions.

![](https://i2.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*28T7UZh9LkSBWtt4V_UNOw.png?w=456&ssl=1)


Next thereâ€™s a pop-up with 7-sections of which layout, surface and volume are of interest to us.

In layout select which view you would like, Iâ€™ve chosen full view which will show eight different viewpoints.

In the surface tab you can select the transparency of the surface mapâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIâ€™ve set it to **0.75**.

![](https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MyEktOl85KFT5bXsa5qDAw.png?w=456&ssl=1)


In the volume tab select ROI drawing, deselect draw all and in the custom box put **37** (the code for hippocampus_L). Then select **Ok**.

### Mango

One of the members of Howardâ€™s laboratory eventually got back to me saying that they used [Mango] to create the brain images and manually tinted the colors onto the brain masks to indicate beta/p values. I tried to get a detailed protocol from them but their response was essentially â€œ**RTFM**â€�

![](https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/1*1tBCudZF2V12-BsXTQm4SQ.png?w=456&ssl=1)


Mango has good video tutorials, user guide and forum (http://rii.uthscsa.edu/mango/forum/) but for those of us whose sole interest is creating a highlighted 3D brain image itâ€™s a lot of material to go through. Therefore, I decided to create a detailed protocol of this process to save others time.

I decided to use the Hammers brain atlas and the sample image provided with Mango

![](https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RRKOGI37hIS3NHrfnbCNEA.png?w=456&ssl=1)


Next select Add Overlay and choose the hippocampus_L.

![](https://i2.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PF4ycLtE5qxnDGRwe7aD-w.png?w=456&ssl=1)


Now select Image > Build Surface to create a 3D representation of the brain.

![](https://i2.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pjGJVJ0iGIqUfKjWWJuiGA.png?w=456&ssl=1)


In this new pop-up GUI thereâ€™s a few things we want to do. First, change the background to white so this can be published in a manuscript. Second, change the transparency of this image to **0.75**.

![](https://i1.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yXJINXCF1Qx-vC7msWJFoA.png?w=456&ssl=1)


Under the View tab deselect the Crosshairs.

![](https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8fs23uqjbryzrZBWb9elKA.png?w=456&ssl=1)


In the other panel select Analysis > Create Logical Overlays then in the surface panel select Shapes > Add Logical.

![](https://i1.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4LmvIqv4B5_5pm-yXH18Ig.png?w=456&ssl=1)


Then under Surface > Views you can select any orientation you like then Surface > Create Snapshot to save as a .png.

Here are three views of the hippocampus_L: **anterior**, **left**and **superior**:

### R Implementation

John Muschelli, an Assistant Scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has authored numerous `R` packages (*e.g.* fslr) responded a couple weeks later to my tweet. He whipped up a gist to highlight a 3D brain image in R.

John Muschelli also teaches a couple of short courses on imaging in R of which Iâ€™m currently taking his [Neurohacking] course. I really appreciate him taking the time to do this.
