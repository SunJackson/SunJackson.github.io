In this post in the R:case4base series we will look at one of the most common operations on multiple data frames – merge, also known as JOIN in SQL terms.

> 
We will learn how to do the 4 basic types of join – inner, left, right and full join with base R and show how to perform the same with tidyverse’s dplyr and data.table’s methods. A quick benchmark will also be included.

Joins

To showcase the merging, we will use a very slightly modified dataset provided by Hadley Wickham’s nycflights13 package, mainly the `flights` and `weather` data frames. Let’s get right into it and simply show how to perform the different types of joins with base R.

First, we prepare the data and store the columns we will merge by (join on) into `mergeCols`:

```
dataurl <- "https://jozefhajnala.gitlab.io/r/post/data/"
weather <- readRDS(url(paste0(dataurl, "r006/weather.rds")))
flights <- readRDS(url(paste0(dataurl, "r006/flights.rds")))

mergeCols <- c("time_hour", "origin")

head(flights)
```

```

```

Now, we show how to perform the 4 merges (joins):

### Inner join

```
inner <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols)
```

### Left (outer) join

```
left <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all.x = TRUE)
```

### Right (outer) join

```
right <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all.y = TRUE)
```

### Full (outer) join

```
full <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all = TRUE)
```

### Other join types

```
# Cross Join (Cartesian product)
cross <- merge(flights, weather, by = NULL)

# Natural Join
natural <- merge(flights, weather)
```

The key arguments of base `merge` data.frame method are:

- `x, y` – the 2 data frames to be merged

- `by` – names of the columns to merge on. If the column names are different in the two data frames to merge, we can specify `by.x` and `by.y` with the names of the columns in the respective data frames. The `by` argument can also be specified by number, logical vector or left unspecified, in which case it defaults to the intersection of the names of the two data frames. From best practice perspective it is advisable to always specify the argument explicitly, ideally by column names.

`all`, `all.x`, `all.y` – default to `FALSE` and can be used specify the type of join we want to perform:

- `all = FALSE` (the default) – gives an inner join – combines the rows in the two data frames that match on the `by` columns

- `all.x = TRUE` – gives a left (outer) join – adds rows that are present in `x`, even though they do not have a matching row in `y` to the result for `all = FALSE`

- `all.y = TRUE` – gives a right (outer) join – adds rows that are present in `y`, even though they do not have a matching row in `x` to the result for `all = FALSE`

- `all = TRUE` – gives a full (outer) join. This is a shorthand for `all.x = TRUE` and `all.y = TRUE`


Other arguments include

- `sort` – if `TRUE` (default), results are sorted on the `by` columns

- `suffixes` – length 2 character vector, specifying the suffixes to be used for making the names of columns in the result which are not used for merging unique

- `incomparables` – for single-column merging only, a vector of values that cannot be matched. Any value in `x` matching a value in this vector is assigned the `nomatch` value (which can be passed using `...`)


For this example, let us have a list of all the data frames included in the `nycflights13` package, slightly updated such that they can me merged with the default value for `by`, purely for this exercise, and store them into a list called `flightsList`:

```
flightsList <- readRDS(url(paste0(dataurl, "r006/nycflights13-list.rds")))
lapply(flightsList, function(x) c(toString(dim(x)), toString(names(x))))
```

```
## $flights
## [1] "336776, 19" 
## [2] "year, month, day, dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, sched_arr_time, arr_delay, carrier, flight, tailnum, origin, dest, air_time, distance, hour, minute, time_hour"
## 
## $weather
## [1] "26115, 15" 
## [2] "origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour"
## 
## $airlines
## [1] "16, 2" "carrier, name"
## 
## $airports
## [1] "1458, 8" 
## [2] "origin, airportname, lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, tzone"
## 
## $planes
## [1] "3322, 9" 
## [2] "tailnum, yearmanufactured, type, manufacturer, model, engines, seats, speed, engine"
```

Since `merge` is designed to work with 2 data frames, merging multiple data frames can of course be achieved by nesting the calls to merge:

```
multiFull <- merge(merge(merge(merge(
 flightsList[[1L]],
 flightsList[[2L]], all = TRUE),
 flightsList[[3L]], all = TRUE),
 flightsList[[4L]], all = TRUE),
 flightsList[[5L]], all = TRUE)
```

We can however achieve this same goal much more elegantly, taking advantage of base R’s `Reduce` function:

```
# For Inner Join
multi_inner <- Reduce(
 function(x, y, ...) merge(x, y, ...), 
 flightsList
)

# For Full (Outer) Join
multi_full <- Reduce(
 function(x, y, ...) merge(x, y, all = TRUE, ...),
 flightsList
)
```

Note that this example is oversimplified and the data was updated such that the default values for `by` give meaningful joins. For example, in the original `planes` data frame the column `year` would have been matched onto the `year` column of the `flights` data frame, which is nonsensical as the years have different meanings in the two data frames. This is why we renamed the `year` column in the `planes` data frame to `yearmanufactured` for the above example.

## Using the tidyverse

The `dplyr` package comes with a set of very user-friendly functions that seem quite self-explanatory:

```
library(dplyr)
inner_dplyr <- inner_join(flights, weather, by = mergeCols)
left_dplyr <- left_join(flights, weather, by = mergeCols)
right_dplyr <- right_join(flights, weather, by = mergeCols)
full_dplyr <- full_join(flights, weather, by = mergeCols)
```

We can also use the “forward pipe” operator `%>%` that becomes very convenient when merging multiple data frames:

```
inner_dplyr <- flights %>% inner_join(weather, by = mergeCols)
left_dplyr <- flights %>% left_join(weather, by = mergeCols)
right_dplyr <- flights %>% right_join(weather, by = mergeCols)
full_dplyr <- flights %>% full_join(weather, by = mergeCols)
```

## Using data.table

The `data.table` package provides an S3 method for the `merge` generic that has a very similar structure to the base method for data frames, meaning its use is very convenient for those familiar with that method. In fact the code is exactly the same as the base one for our example use.

> 
One important difference worth noting is that the `by` argument is by default constructed differently with data.table.


We however provide it explicitly, therefore this difference does not directly affect our example:

```
library(data.table)
weather <- as.data.table(weather)
flights <- as.data.table(flights)
setkeyv(weather, mergeCols)
setkeyv(flights, mergeCols)

# Note that this is identical to the code for base 
# The data.table method is called automatically for objects of class data.table
inner_dt <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols)
left_dt <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all.x = TRUE)
right_dt <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all.y = TRUE)
full_dt <- merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, we can write `data.table` joins as subsets:

```
inner_dt <- flights[weather, on = mergeCols, nomatch = 0]
left_dt <- weather[flights, on = mergeCols]
right_dt <- flights[weather, on = mergeCols]
```

For a quick overview, lets look at a basic benchmark without package loading overhead for each of the mentioned packages:



## Inner join

```
bench_inner <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(times = 100,
 base = base::merge.data.frame(flights, weather, by = mergeCols),
 base_nosort = base::merge.data.frame(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, sort = FALSE),
 dt_merge = merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols),
 dt_subset = flights[weather, on = mergeCols, nomatch = 0], 
 dplyr = inner_join(flights, weather, by = mergeCols),
 dplyr_pipe = flights %>% inner_join(weather, by = mergeCols)
)
```




## Full (outer) join

```
bench_outer <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(times = 100,
 base = base::merge.data.frame(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all = TRUE),
 base_nosort = base::merge.data.frame(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all = TRUE, sort = FALSE),
 dt_merge = merge(flights, weather, by = mergeCols, all = TRUE),
 dplyr = full_join(flights, weather, by = mergeCols),
 dplyr_pipe = flights %>% full_join(weather, by = mergeCols)
)
```




> 
Visualizing the results in this case shows base R comes way behind the two alternatives, even with `sort = FALSE`.


Note: The benchmarks are ran on a standard droplet by DigitalOcean, with 2GB of memory a 2vCPUs.
