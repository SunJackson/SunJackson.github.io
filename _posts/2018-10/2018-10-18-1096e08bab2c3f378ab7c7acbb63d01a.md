I recently published an article summarizing some of my ideas on ethics in statistics, going over these recommendations:

1. Open data and open methods,

2. Be clear about the information that goes into statistical procedures,

3. Create a culture of respect for data,

4. Publication of criticisms,

5. Respect the limitations of statistics.
