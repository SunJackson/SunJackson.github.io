In previous posts (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/monotonic-binning-with-smbinning-package) and (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/finer-monotonic-binning-based-on-isotonic-regression), I’ve developed 2 different algorithms for monotonic binning. While the first tends to generate bins with equal densities, the second would define finer bins based on the isotonic regression. 

In the code snippet below, a third approach would be illustrated for the purpose to generate bins with roughly equal-sized bads. Once again, for the reporting layer, I leveraged the flexible smbinning::smbinning.custom() function with a small tweak. 

As shown in the output, the number of bads in each bin, with the exception for missings, is similar and varying within a small range. However, the number of records tends to increase to ensure the monotonicity of bad rates across all bins.
