Paul Pudaite points to this post by Stacy McGaugh entitled, “The dwarf galaxy NGC1052-DF2.” Pudaite writes that it’s an interesting comment on consequences of excluding one outlier.

I can’t really follow what’s going on here but I thought I’d share it for the benefit of all the astronomers out there.

**P.S.** Apparently it is common for giant galaxies to have some dwarf satellite galaxies. Who knew?
