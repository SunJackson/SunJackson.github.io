**Optimistic Lower Bounds Optimization (OLBO)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
While model-based reinforcement learning has empirically been shown to significantly reduce the sample complexity that hinders model-free RL, the theoretical understanding of such methods has been rather limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic framework for designing and analyzing model-based RL algorithms with theoretical guarantees, and a practical algorithm Optimistic Lower Bounds Optimization (OLBO). In particular, we derive a theoretical guarantee of monotone improvement for model-based RL with our framework. We iteratively build a lower bound of the expected reward based on the estimated dynamical model and sample trajectories, and maximize it jointly over the policy and the model. Assuming the optimization in each iteration succeeds, the expected reward is guaranteed to improve. The framework also incorporates an optimism-driven perspective, and reveals the intrinsic measure for the model prediction error. Preliminary simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms the standard baselines on continuous control benchmark tasks. …

In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have become an enabling technology for a wide range of novel embedded Artificial Intelligence systems. Across the range of applications, the performance needs vary significantly, from high-throughput video surveillance to the very low-latency requirements of autonomous cars. In this context, FPGAs can provide a potential platform that can be optimally configured based on the different performance needs. However, the complexity of ConvNet models keeps increasing making their mapping to an FPGA device a challenging task. This work presents fpgaConvNet, an end-to-end framework for mapping ConvNets on FPGAs. The proposed framework employs an automated design methodology based on the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) paradigm and defines a set of SDF transformations in order to efficiently explore the architectural design space. By selectively optimising for throughput, latency or multiobjective criteria, the presented tool is able to efficiently explore the design space and generate hardware designs from high-level ConvNet specifications, explicitly optimised for the performance metric of interest. Overall, our framework yields designs that improve the performance by up to 6.65x over highly optimised embedded GPU designs for the same power constraints in embedded environments. … 

**EgoNet** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
EgoNet (Egocentric Network Study Software) for the collection and analysis of egocentric social network data. It helps the user to collect and analyse all the egocentric network data (all social network data of a website on the Internet), and provide general global network measures and data matrixes that can be used for further analysis by other software. The egonet is the result of the links that it gives and receives certain address on the Internet, and EgoNet is dedicated to collecting information about them and present it in a way useful to the users. Egonet is written in Java, so that the computer where it is going to be used must have the JRE installed. EgoNet is open source software, licensed under GPL.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)
