It has been a year since the tragic event of September 2017. We now know what happened, and it is a tremendously sad story of undiagnosed type 1 diabetes.

This summer at MSR Michael was still very present in our discussions, whether it was about some ideas that we discussed that last 2017 summer (acceleration, metrical task systems lower bounds, etc…), or just some random fun story.

I highly recommend to take look at the YouTube videos from the November 2017 symposium in memory of Michael. You can also take a look at his (still growing) list of publications on arxiv. In fact I know of an upcoming major paper so stay tuned (the premises are in Yin Tat’s talk at the symposium).

As always when remembering this tragic loss my thoughts go to Michael’s family.
