Machine learning thrives on large, well-organized and labeled training data sets. Big Data - large data sets collected in the real world - is often not. These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches that help us to discover the inherent structure in the data, and visualize them. Find out how **Google is** handling that!

**Microsoft** uses GPU enabled Deep Learning Virtual Machines available on Microsoft Azure AI platform to show how engineers can leverage open-source deep learning frameworks like Keras to build end to end intelligent signal classification solutions. Learn all about it!

This session is about the renowned Berlin painter Roman Lipski, who has been working for two years with his Artificial Muse A.I.R., which inspires and augments him in his artistic work and pushes him to new frontiers. The latest generation of the muse is based on generative networks and allows for an intuitive and fluid interaction between artist and algorithm... Read more!
