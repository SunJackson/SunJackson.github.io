Welcome to week 6 of the *Data Science with R Course Series*.

This week’s curriculum is an extension of week 5, where we started analyzing model performance.

This week will cover the following:

- Learn techniques to **communicate and measure model performance**

- Learn how to **analyze individual machine learning model metrics**

- Learn how to visually **compare multiple models** based on metrics

- Learn how to **communicate model performance** to different stakeholders



Here is a recap of our trajectory and the course overview:

## Recap: Data Science With R Course Series

You’re in the Week 6: H2O Model Performance. Here’s our game-plan over the 10 articles in this series. We’ll cover how to apply **data science for business with R** following our systematic process.

## Week 6: H2O Model Performance

### Performance Overview & Setup

The *Performance Overview & Setup* module summarizes this week’s course material and reviews the required code, such as extracted `H2O` machine learning models and utility script files.

H2O Performance For Binary Classification
Learn how to create an `H2O` performance object to retrieve model metrics, such as AUC and logloss. Each `H2O` auto-generated machine learning model can be extracted and saved to memory.

Once the machine learning models are saved, you will learn how to:

- Compare two competing metrics in binary classification

- Compare top performing models using the AUC metric

Performance Charts For Data Scientists
In *Performance Charts For Data Scientists*, take your knowledge on how to measure the performance of a single classifier and create a plot that will measure the performance of multiple models.

Performance charting is a great way for data scientists to **evaluate model performance** using different metrics.





Performance Charts For Business People
All your efforts to this point have been to create a high-performance model that accurately predicts employee churn. However, business people will not be receptive to the language of data science.

In this module, learn how to create a chart for business people to understand **how much a model will improve results**. The performance chart for business people will help communicate what can be done to solve the problem and understand how serious the problem is.

Ultimate Model Performance Comparison Dashboard
In this lecture, you will create a model metrics dashboard that combines the performance chart for data scientists and performance chart for business people into one visualization. Combining the charts assist in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of multiple models in one view.

**To be efficient as a data scientist, you need to learn R.** Take the course that has **cut data science projects in half** (see this testimonial from a leading data science consultant) and has **progressed data scientists more than anything they have tried before**. Over 10-weeks you learn what it has taken data scientists 10-years to learn:

- Our systematic data science for business framework

- R and H2O for Machine Learning

- How to produce Return-On-Investment from data science

- And much more.

## Next Up

The next article in the ***Data Science With R Series*** covers **Modeling Churn: Explaining Black-Box Models With LIME**.

Week 7 will cover feature explanation using a the R library `Lime`. Prediction explanation is important as a data scientist in order to communicate model results. Using `Lime`, you will **learn how to explain your machine learning model and empower business people to make better decisions**.
