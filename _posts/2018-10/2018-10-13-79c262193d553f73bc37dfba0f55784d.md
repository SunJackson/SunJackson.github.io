Inspired by a recent post on how to import a directory of csv files at once using purrr and readr by Garrick, in this post we will try achieving the same using base R with no extra packages, and with data·table, another very popular package and as an added bonus, we will play a bit with benchmarking to see which of the methods is the fastest, including the tidyverse approach in the benchmark.

Let us show how to import all csvs from a folder into a data frame, with nothing but base R


To get the source data, download the zip file from this link and unzip it into a folder, we will refer to the folder path as `data_dir`.

To import all .csv files from the `data_dir` directory and place them into a single data frame called `result`, all we have to do is:

```
filePaths <- list.files(data_dir, "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
result <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filePaths, read.csv))

# View part of the result
head(result)
```

```

## 5 General Medicine General Referral 18
## 6 General Surgery General Referral 43
```

## A quick explanation of the code:

- `list.files` – produces a character vector of the names of the files in the named directory, in our case `data_dir`. We have also passed a `pattern` argument `"\\.csv$"` to make sure we only process files with .csv at the end of the name and `full.names = TRUE` to get the file path and not just the name.

- `read.csv` – reads a file in table format and creates a data frame from its content

- `lapply(X, FUN, ...)`– Gives us a list of data.frames, one for each of the files found by `list.files`. More generally, it returns a list of the same length as `X`, each element of which is the result of applying `FUN` to the corresponding element of `X`. In our case `X` is the vector of file names in data_dir (returned by `list.files`) and `FUN` is `read.csv`, so we are applying `read.csv` to each of the file paths

- `rbind` – in our case combines the rows of multiple data frames into one, similarly (even though a bit more rigidly) to `UNION` in `SQL`

- `do.call` – will combine all the data frames produced by `lapply` into one using `rbind`. More generally, it constructs and executes a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to it. In our case the function is `rbind` and the list is the list of data frames containing the data loaded from the csvs, produced by `lapply`.


To fully reconstruct the results from the original post, we need to do two extra operations

- Add the source file names to the data frame

- Fix and reformat the dates


To do this, we will simply adjust the `FUN` in the `lapply` – in the above example, we have only used `read.csv`. Below, we will make a small function to do the extra steps:

```
filePaths <- list.files(data_dir, "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
result <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filePaths, function(path) {
 df <- read.csv(path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
 df[["source"]] <- rep(path, nrow(df))
 df[["Month_Year"]] <- as.Date(
 paste0(sub("-20", "-", df[["Month_Year"]], fixed = TRUE), "-01"),
 format = "%b-%y-%d"
 )
 df
}))

# View part of the result
head(result)
```

```

```

Lets look at the extra code in the `lapply`:

- Instead of just using `read.csv`, we have defined our own little function that will do the extra work for each of the file paths, which are passed to the function as `path`

- We read the data into a data frame called `df` using `read.csv`, and can we specify `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`, as the tidyverse packages do this by default, while base R’s default is different

- We add a new column `source` with the file name stored in `path`, repeated as many times as `df` has rows. This is a bit overkill here and could be done simpler, but it is quite robust and will also work with 0-row data frames

- We transform the `Month_Year` into the requested date format with `as.Date`. Note that the relatively ugly `sub()` part is caused mostly by inconsistency in the source data itself

- Using `[[` instead of `$` is less pleasing to the eye, but we find it to be good practice, so sacrifice a bit of readability


## Using data.table

Another popular package that can help us achieve the same is `data.table`, so let’s have a look and reconstruct the results with data.table’s features:

```
library(data.table)

filePaths <- list.files(data_dir, "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
result <- rbindlist(lapply(filePaths, function(x) {
 r <- fread(x)
 r[, ':='(
 source = x,
 Month_Year = as.Date(
 paste0(sub("-20", "-", r[, Month_Year], fixed = TRUE), "-01"),
 format = "%b-%y-%d"
 )
 )]
}))

# View part of the result
head(result)
```

```

## 6: data/r005/ie-general-referrals-by-hospital//general-referrals-by-hospital-department-2015.csv
```

Where

- `rbindlist` does the same as `do.call("rbind", l)` on data frames, but much faster

- `fread` is similar to `read.table` (and `read.csv`, which uses `read.table`) but faster and more convenient

- `':='()` is the data.table syntax to create multiple new columns in a data.table (data frame)


boxplot

Visualizing the results in this case shows that data.table is a winner, with base R being the slowest of the options.
