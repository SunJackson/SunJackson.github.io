 – 

Its been almost two years since I first hosted this blog as an alternative outlet of my writings. Everything is currently being built using jekyll and hosted in github. It works fine but I want to have more control over the deployment of the site, using my own server and domain.

Also, my new blog is now based on Hugo using package `blogdown` and template academic. This format offers far more functionality and it is great! You can check the new site at http://www.msperlin.com/blog.

I’ll still keep this site for a couple of months but it won’t be updated any more. Every other material such as online books are also going to be migrated to the new domain.
