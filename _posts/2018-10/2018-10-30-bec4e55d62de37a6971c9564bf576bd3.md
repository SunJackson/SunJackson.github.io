Today, the world's largest enterprises have recognized the benefits of leveraging third-party code. According to Gartner, as much as 95% of IT organizations leverage open source software (OSS) within their mission-critical applications.

However, just because open source is ubiquitous doesn't mean it's risk-free. Incorporating OSS into your project often comes with licensing terms that place obligations on how you can distribute your product.

- Licensing myths and risks

- DIY risk management

- The importance of enterprise legal indemnification
