**Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning: A Constrained Optimization Viewpoint**

The classic objective in a reinforcement learning (RL) problem is to find a policy that minimizes, in expectation, a long-run objective such as the infinite-horizon discounted or long-run average cost. In many practical applications, optimizing the expected value alone is not sufficient, and it may be necessary to include a risk measure in the optimization process, either as the objective or as a constraint. Various risk measures have been proposed in the literature, e.g., mean-variance tradeoff, exponential utility, the percentile performance, value at risk, conditional value at risk, prospect theory and its later enhancement, cumulative prospect theory. In this article, we focus on the combination of risk criteria and reinforcement learning in a constrained optimization framework, i.e., a setting where the goal to find a policy that optimizes the usual objective of infinite-horizon discounted/average cost, while ensuring that an explicit risk constraint is satisfied. We introduce the risk-constrained RL framework, cover popular risk measures based on variance, conditional value-at-risk and cumulative prospect theory, and present a template for a risk-sensitive RL algorithm. We survey some of our recent work on this topic, covering problems encompassing discounted cost, average cost, and stochastic shortest path settings, together with the aforementioned risk measures in a constrained framework. This non-exhaustive survey is aimed at giving a flavor of the challenges involved in solving a risk-sensitive RL problem, and outlining some potential future research directions.

**A Simple Baseline Algorithm for Graph Classification**

Graph classification has recently received a lot of attention from various fields of machine learning e.g. kernel methods, sequential modeling or graph embedding. All these approaches offer promising results with different respective strengths and weaknesses. However, most of them rely on complex mathematics and require heavy computational power to achieve their best performance. We propose a simple and fast algorithm based on the spectral decomposition of graph Laplacian to perform graph classification and get a first reference score for a dataset. We show that this method obtains competitive results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

**What is an Ontology?**

In the knowledge engineering community ‘ontology’ is usually defined in the tradition of Gruber as an ‘explicit specification of a conceptualization’. Several variations of this definition exist. In the paper we argue that (with one notable exception) these definitions are of no explanatory value, because they violate one of the basic rules for good definitions: The defining statement (the definiens) should be clearer than the term that is defined (the definiendum). In the paper we propose a different definition of ‘ontology’ and discuss how it helps to explain various phenomena: the ability of ontologies to change, the role of the choice of vocabulary, the significance of annotations, the possibility of collaborative ontology development, and the relationship between ontological conceptualism and ontological realism.

**Node Representation Learning for Directed Graphs**

We propose a novel approach for learning node representations in directed graphs, which maintains separate views or embedding spaces for the two distinct node roles induced by the directionality of the edges. In order to achieve this, we propose a novel alternating random walk strategy to generate training samples from the directed graph while preserving the role information. These samples are then trained using Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) with nodes retaining their source/target semantics. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation to showcase our effectiveness on several real-world datasets on link prediction, multi-label classification and graph reconstruction tasks. We show that the embeddings from our approach are indeed robust, generalizable and well performing across multiple kinds of tasks and networks. We show that we consistently outperform all random-walk based neural embedding methods for link prediction and graph reconstruction tasks. In addition to providing a theoretical interpretation of our method we also show that we are more considerably robust than the other directed graph approaches.

**Alternating Linear Bandits for Online Matrix-Factorization Recommendation**

We consider the problem of online collaborative filtering in the online setting, where items are recommended to the users over time. At each time step, the user (selected by the environment) consumes an item (selected by the agent) and provides a rating of the selected item. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for online matrix factorization recommendation that combines linear bandits and alternating least squares. In this formulation, the bandit feedback is equal to the difference between the ratings of the best and selected items. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm over time using both cumulative regret and average cumulative NDCG. Simulation results over three synthetic datasets as well as three real-world datasets for online collaborative filtering indicate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over two state-of-the-art online algorithms.

**An Exploration of Dropout with RNNs for Natural Language Inference**

Dropout is a crucial regularization technique for the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models of Natural Language Inference (NLI). However, dropout has not been evaluated for the effectiveness at different layers and dropout rates in NLI models. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model for NLI and empirically evaluate the effect of applying dropout at different layers in the model. We also investigate the impact of varying dropout rates at these layers. Our empirical evaluation on a large (Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)) and a small (SciTail) dataset suggest that dropout at each feed-forward connection severely affects the model accuracy at increasing dropout rates. We also show that regularizing the embedding layer is efficient for SNLI whereas regularizing the recurrent layer improves the accuracy for SciTail. Our model achieved an accuracy 86.14% on the SNLI dataset and 77.05% on SciTail.
