If you’re in data science, machine learning, or AI, you’ve probably heard of the “black box” problem: the regulatory and implementation barriers caused by the un-explainability of sophisticated AI. When it comes to compliance, the black box problem is *the *hurdle standing in the way of AI’s march to global integration.

So long as it remains unsolved, AI will never realize its potential.

Recognizing that fact, a collection of tech entrepreneurs and regulators worked together to create an in-depth handbook on this challenge:

*The Amazing, Anti-Jargon, Insight Filled, and Totally Free Handbook to Integrating AI in Highly Regulated Industries. *

The handbook covers the entire breadth of the issue, from AI’s untapped potential in these industries to specific steps and strategies firms can take to demystify their AI.

While the piece is targeted at professionals working in financial services, healthcare, or other highly regulated industries, it’s a valuable read for regulators, AI enthusiasts, or anyone interested in hot issues in tech.

A free download of the 64-page handbook is **available here**.
