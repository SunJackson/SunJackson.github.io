Dear Igor,

I'm a long-time reader of your blog and wanted to share our recent paper on a relation between compressed sensing and neural network architectures. The paper introduces a new network construction based on the Laplace transform that results in activations such as ReLU and gating/threshold functions. It would be great if you could distribute the link on nuit-blanche.

Many thanks and best regards,Steffen

This paper presents a theoretical and conceptual framework
to design neural architectures for Bayesian compressive
sensing of simplex-constrained sparse stochastic vectors. First
we recast the problem of MMSE estimation (w.r.t. a pre-defined
uniform input distribution over the simplex) as the problem
of computing the centroid of a polytope that is equal to the
intersection of the simplex and an affine subspace determined
by compressive measurements. Then we use multidimensional
Laplace techniques to obtain a closed-form solution to this
computation problem, and we show how to map this solution to
a neural architecture comprising threshold functions, rectified linear
(ReLU) and rectified polynomial (ReP) activation functions.
In the proposed architecture, the number of layers is equal to the
number of measurements which allows for faster solutions in the
low-measurement regime when compared to the integration by
domain decomposition or Monte-Carlo approximation. We also
show by simulation that the proposed solution is robust to small
model mismatches; furthermore, the proposed architecture yields
superior approximations with less parameters when compared to
a standard ReLU architecture in a supervised learning setting.
