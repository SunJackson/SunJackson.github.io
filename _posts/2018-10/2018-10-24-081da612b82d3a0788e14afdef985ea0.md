Today after over a decade of programming, I was reminded that programming is hard.

I was committing a fix to PyMC3 (but it could have been any project, and I definitely make those mistakes professionally), and Thomas was good enough to point out ‘break-point committed’.

JD Long shared his own war stories.

The lesson I think is

1. Humans make mistakes make sure you have good processes.

1. Juniors don’t be ashamed by your mistakes we all make them!
