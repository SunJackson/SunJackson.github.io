**Learning Automata Based SVM (LA-SVM)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
As an indispensable defensive measure of network security, the intrusion detection is a process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents. It is a classifier to judge the event is normal or malicious. The information used for intrusion detection contains some redundant features which would increase the difficulty of training the classifier for intrusion detection and increase the time of making predictions. To simplify the training process and improve the efficiency of the classifier, it is necessary to remove these dispensable features. in this paper, we propose a novel LA-SVM scheme to automatically remove redundant features focusing on intrusion detection. This is the first application of learning automata for solving dimension reduction problems. The simulation results indicate that the LA-SVM scheme achieves a higher accuracy and is more efficient in making predictions compared with traditional SVM. … 

**learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction (SEAL)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Traditional methods for link prediction can be categorized into three main types: graph structure feature-based, latent feature-based, and explicit feature-based. Graph structure feature methods leverage some handcrafted node proximity scores, e.g., common neighbors, to estimate the likelihood of links. Latent feature methods rely on factorizing networks’ matrix representations to learn an embedding for each node. Explicit feature methods train a machine learning model on two nodes’ explicit attributes. Each of the three types of methods has its unique merits. In this paper, we propose SEAL (learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction), a new framework for link prediction which combines the power of all the three types into a single graph neural network (GNN). GNN is a new type of neural network which directly accepts graphs as input and outputs their labels. In SEAL, the input to the GNN is a local subgraph around each target link. We prove theoretically that our local subgraphs also reserve a great deal of high-order graph structure features related to link existence. Another key feature is that our GNN can naturally incorporate latent features and explicit features. It is achieved by concatenating node embeddings (latent features) and node attributes (explicit features) in the node information matrix for each subgraph, thus combining the three types of features to enhance GNN learning. Through extensive experiments, SEAL shows unprecedentedly strong performance against a wide range of baseline methods, including various link prediction heuristics and network embedding methods. … 

**Bias-Compensated Normalized Maximum Correntropy Criterion (BCNMCC)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper proposed a bias-compensated normalized maximum correntropy criterion (BCNMCC) algorithm charactered by its low steady-state misalignment for system identification with noisy input in an impulsive output noise environment. The normalized maximum correntropy criterion (NMCC) is derived from a correntropy based cost function, which is rather robust with respect to impulsive noises. To deal with the noisy input, we introduce a bias-compensated vector (BCV) to the NMCC algorithm, and then an unbiasedness criterion and some reasonable assumptions are used to compute the BCV. Taking advantage of the BCV, the bias caused by the input noise can be effectively suppressed. System identification simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BCNMCC algorithm can outperform other related algorithms with noisy input especially in an impulsive output noise environment. …
