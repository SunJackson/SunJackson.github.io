The third release of the binb package just arrived on CRAN, and it comes with a new (and very crispy) theme: Monash. With that we are also thrilled to welcome Rob Hyndman as a co-author.

Here is a quick demo combining all (by now four) themes:

Also, Ista made the IQSS theme more robust to font selection. Other changes:

> 
Changes in binb version 0.0.3 (2018-10-12)


The IQSS theme now has a fallback font if Libertinus is unavailable (Ista in #7)


Added support for ‘Monash’ theme (Rob Hyndman in #10 and #11 closing #9)


Simplified some options for the ‘Monash’ theme (Dirk in #13)
