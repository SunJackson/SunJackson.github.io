**For the last months, ThinkR has been involved (with Mango, Procogia and the Linux Foundation) in a working group for an RConsortium R Certification.**



### Why this Working Group (WG)?

No **doubt the demand for R (and for Data Science) has been increasing over the past few years** â€” Data Scientist became the sexiest job of the century according to Harvard Business Review, and Glassdoor listed it as the â€œBest Job in Americaâ€� in 2016, 2017 and 2018. No need to argue on that point: data science is now one of the top skills to have on the market.

With the growth in interest came a growth of demands both from employers and people looking to improve their skills. To support this, several channels of training have been made available.

But even with that, itâ€™s still complex today for the three parties involved in the field:

- **students** (in a broad sense), who do not know where to start, and if self-taught donâ€™t know how to â€œofficiallyâ€� validate their skills

- **teachers** and **trainers**, who have to face a constantly innovating field, and might not be able to identify the skills needed on the market

- **recruiters**, who might find it hard to identify key skills, diplomas, and certifications


The RConsortium came to the conclusion that there was no â€œofficial R certificationâ€� to assess oneâ€™s skills when it comes to R. Hence this WG, working to establish some ground rules for this certification.

### Towards a certification

This certification will be useful for two key things:

- it will allow **professionals and students to acquire practical, industry-driven skills in R**

- it will **help recruiter to identify the skills** of potential recruits


As it is crucial for this certification to be industry & community-driven, we are currently conducting a little survey to get an overview of the current state of the sector, worldwide.

It would definitely help us a lot if you could take 3 minutes to answer this one ![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)
