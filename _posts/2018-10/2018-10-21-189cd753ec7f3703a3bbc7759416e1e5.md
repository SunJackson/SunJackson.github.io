## Deep Learning existing frameworks, disadvantages


Deploying and maintaining most Deep Learning frameworks means: Pythonâ€¦R language is so simple to install and maintain in production environments that it is obvious to use a pure R based package for deep learning !

## Neural Network â€“ Deep Learning, disadvantages



- 1st disadvantage: you have to test manually different combinations of parameters (number of layers, nodes, activation function, etc â€¦) and then also tune manually hyper parameters for training (learning rate, momentum, mini batch size, etc â€¦)
- 2nd disadvantage: only for those who are not mathematicians, calculating derivative in case of new cost or activation function, may by an issue.

## Metaheuristic â€“ PSO, benefits


The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a great and simple one.In a few words, the first step consists in throwing randomly a set of particles in a space and the next steps consist in discovering the best solution while converging.

video tutorial from Yarpiz is a great ressource

## Birth of automl package


automl package was born from the idea to use metaheuristic PSO to address the identified disadvantages above.And last but not the least reason: use R and R only ![](https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)

3 functions are available:
## Mix 1: hyperparameters tuning with PSO


Mix 1 consists in using PSO algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters: each particle corresponds to a set of hyperparameters.The automl train function was made to do that.

nb: parameters (nodes number, activation functions, etcâ€¦) are not automatically tuned for the moment, but why not in the futur

## Mix 2: PSO instead of gradient descent


Mix 2 is experimental, it consists in using PSO algorithm to optimize the weights of Neural Network in place of gradient descent: each particle corresponds to a set of neural network weights matrices.The automl train manual function do that too.
