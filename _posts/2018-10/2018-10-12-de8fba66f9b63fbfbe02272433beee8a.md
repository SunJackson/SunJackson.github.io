My prior post on animated flow in the Delaware River contained the last work I performed on my previous lap top just before it gave up the ghost.  When a colleague asked me to share it, I was distressed to realize that the script was lost.  I decided to recreate the script from scratch and to fix one the limitations of the older version by making it easily transportable to other river systems.  Specifically, all the USGS gage numbers, drainage areas, and river miles are contained in a .csv file.  To apply the new script to the different river, I just need to populate the .csv with local information.  I’m glad I did that, since there were several high flow events at other rivers that I wanted to inspect using this script.


Above is the Neuse River after Hurricane Florence.  I also applied this to the Susquehanna River and the Schuylkill River.
