My current position is Principal Data Scientist and Executive Advisor at global technology consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. In this role, I am frequently asked many questions about the work we are doing, specifically with the U.S. federal government. I always defer those types of questions to open source materials, including articles, press releases, and content published on my company’s website.

I was recently asked about federal government applications of blockchain technology. I found an amazing collection of online (open source) articles and content on this topic. You can check out the list here:
