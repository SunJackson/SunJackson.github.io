This past week on KDnuggets we shared a roadmap to learning GANs, offered up an introductory tutorial using Keras for deep learning, learned how to perform named entity recognition with common Python tools, got certain about uncertainty, saw consistency in poll results on the largest datasets our readers analyzed, and learned about open source automated machine learning tools. Don't forget to participate in the latest KDnuggets poll, How Important is Understanding Machine Learning Models?
