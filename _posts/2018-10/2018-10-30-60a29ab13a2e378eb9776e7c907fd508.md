Deep Learning methods build very good prediction and classification models, but they are very hard for humans to understand. 


The European 

GDPR laws enacted in May 2018, which give consumers some

right to explanation of decision made about them by algorithms,
and recent story about
Amazon scrapping
their internal recruiting tool because of bias against women,
highlight the importance of understanding Machine Learning models in many areas.


New KDnuggets poll below aims to measure the current importance of understanding of ML models. Please vote!
