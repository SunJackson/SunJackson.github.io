R offers several ways to reverse a string, include some base R options. We go through a few of those in this post. We’ll also compare the computational time for each method.

Reversing a string can be especially useful in bioinformatics (e.g. finding the reverse compliment of a DNA strand). To get started, let’s generate a random string of 10 million DNA bases (we can do this with the **stringi** package as well, but for our purposes here, let’s just use base R functions).

## **1) Base R with strsplit and paste**

One way to reverse a string is to use **strsplit** with **paste**. This is the slowest method that will be shown, but it does get the job done without needing any packages. In this example, we use **strsplit** to break the string into a vector of its individual characters. We then reverse this vector using **rev**. Finally, we concatenate the vector of characters into a string using **paste**.

## **2) Base R: Using utf8 magic**

This example also does not require any external packages. In this method, we can use the built-in R function **utf8ToInt** to convert our DNA string to a vector of integers. We then reverse this vector with the **rev** function. Lastly, we convert this reversed vector of integers back to its original encoding – except now the string is in reverse.

## **3) The stringi package**

Of all the examples presented, this option is the fastest when tested. Here we use the **stri_reverse** function from the stringi package.

## **4) The Biostrings package**

Our last example uses the Biostrings package, which contains a collection of functions useful for working with DNA-string data. One function, called **str_rev**, can reverse strings. You can download and load the Biostrings package like this:

Then, all we have to do is input our DNA string into the **str_rev** function and we get our result.
