Natural selection is the process by which some form of selective pressure favours a **phenotypic** trait or change. These phenotypic traits can be the blood group of a person, whether a pea is wrinkly or not, or whether an infectious organism is susceptible or resistant to a drug. Many times these phenotypic traits, or physical attributes, are caused by genetics.

**Genotyping** is the process by which one can infer this phenotypic trait from a genotype, and this is used more and more frequently in medicine. For exampe, in breast cancer treatment, the BRCA (BReast CAncer) genes are genotyped to determine whether these cancer suppressing genes are intact. If there is a deleterious or damaging mutation in one of these genes, it can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, thus a phenotype of increased risk of breast cancer.

For most organisms, the copying of genetic material happens by very precise enzymes or pathways, but occasionally mutations do occur. If a mutation occurs and is sufficiently damaging, it gets removed from the gene pool. However, if the mutation is sufficiently beneficial, it increases the survival of this genetic variation and might biasly select for it.

In the previous post, we discussed **ARVs** (antiretrovirals) and how these drugs changed the landscape of HIV infection by preventing the development of AIDS. We mentioned that ARVs suppress viral replication. One of the steps in HIV replication is the conversion of its single-stranded RNA to DNA, which can then be incorporated into the DNA of infected cells. The enzyme responsible for this conversion is reverse transcriptase, and it has a high error rate when doing this conversion. One can thus say that HIV has a high evolutionary rate, or mutation rate. These genes are translated into viral proteins, which are required to make more virions (viral particles). Proteins are strings or polymers of amino acid residues with an alphabet of 20 choices of amino acids or letters. The sequence of the DNA or RNA influences the sequence of the protein; thus, mutations in the DNA or RNA can result in changes in the protein, and our targets for stopping HIV replication are proteins/enzymes.

There are various classes of ARVs which interfere with viral replication by inhibition of viral enzymes. If the DNA or RNA sequence encoding this enzyme is changed, the result might be an unfit virus not capable of further infection or replication. On the other hand, if this mutation results in an ARV-resistant virus, replication and infection can still continue in the presence of the ARV in question, possibly causing the ARV to become ineffective in stopping replication.

The question remains, why do people develop resistance? The short answer: it’s a numbers game.

If the patient received the correct regimen of ARVs (known as **HAART**, or highly active antiretroviral treatment) and is taking the doses correctly, the viral load will suppress. Suppression is caused by stopping viral replication, and if the virus is not replicating, the error-prone reverse transcriptase can’t cause mutations, which in turn cannot be favoured by selective pressure. If the patient is not taking any treatment, the virus is replicating and thus inevitably mutating, but there is no selective pressure to select for these variants. Lastly, if the patient is adhering poorly to the treatment, there are times where the levels of the treatment are too low to effectively suppress viral replication completely. In this scenario, mutants with a mutation which makes them less susceptible to the treatment will replicate more than the wild type counterparts – these are called escape mutants.

The reason why this is a numbers game is that the virus is mutating randomly and one resulting amino acid residue could be replaced by any of 19 other amino acid residues. It is only when this change causes an increase in replicative fitness while there is some form of selective pressure that this mutant can become a dominant quasi-species and the patient develops resistance.

Mutations are expressed using the notation `[WT AA][POS][Mutant AA]`, where:

- WT denotes wild type (the typical genotype)

- AA denotes amino acid residue

- POS denotes the position on the protein

- Mutant means the changed genotype


We mentioned some classes of ARVs in part 1. To the viral reverse transcriptase, **NRTIs** (Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors) look like the building blocks of DNA called nucleotides. If the reverse transcriptase incorporates one of these ‘fake’ nucleotides, it is not able to further extend the DNA strand, leaving it incomplete, thus interfering with replication. Not all mutations cause the same level of resistance. These levels are:

|------
|Susceptible|0 to 9|
|Potential low-level resistance|10 to 14|
|Low-level resistance|15 to 29|
|Intermediate resistance|30 to 59|
|High-level resistance|>= 60|

We can plot resistance scores for five commonly used NRTIs.

```
nrti_dr_scores <- read_tsv("ScoresNRTI_1555579653110.tsv", col_types = "cdcddddddd")

nrti_dr_scores %>% 
 select(Rule, ABC:AZT, FTC:TDF) %>% 
 gather(arv, score, 2:6) %>% 
 filter(!grepl(" ", Rule)) %>% 
 mutate(effect = ifelse(score > 0, "resistance", "hyper-susceptible")) %>% 
 
 ggplot(aes(x = Rule, y = score, fill = effect)) +

We can see that 3TC and FTC have the exact same profiles, and they are chemically also very similar, as shown in the figure below.
