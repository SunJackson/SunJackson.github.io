The **rasterList** package has been developed to create a S4 class object that can manage complex operations and objects in a spatially gridded map, i.e. a raster map. The *rasterList-Class* (Cordano 2017b) object differs from a traditional raster map by the fact that each cell can contain a generic object instead of numeric values on one or more bands or layers. The raster of objects, i.e. the *RasterList-class* object, consists on a *rasterLayer-Class* (Hijmans 2016) connected to a generic list: one list element for each raster cells. It allows to write few lines of R code for complex map algebra. Furthermore, in accordance with the existing classes defined in the R environment, each cell of the raster is “occupied” by an an istanced object. This may be of utitily plenty in most applications, e.g. environmental modellig.

It it is assumed that each cell of a raster maps has its own soil water retention curve. Therefore to map the soil water retion curve and not only its parameters, **rasterList** package is loaded:

The study area is is the area of the *meuse* dataset (n.d.):

A soil map is avaialbe from soil type according to the 1:50 000 soil map of the Netherlands. In the Meuse site, the following soil type are present

- 1 = Rd10A (Calcareous weakly-developed meadow soils, light sandy clay);

- 2 = Rd90C/VII (Non-calcareous weakly-developed meadow soils, heavy sandy clay to light clay);

- 3 = Bkd26/VII (Red Brick soil, fine-sandy, silty light clay) which can be respectively assimilated as:


A geografic view of Meuse test case is available though **leaflet** package (Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2018):


Therefore, a map of each VanGenuchten (1980)’s formula parameter can be obtained as follow (The names of saturated and residual water contents *swc* and *rwc* mean ![](https://i2.wp.com/www.milanor.net/blog/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_ac7248005919fec412dfea5e3b5f65b8.gif?w=456)

 according to the the arguments of *swc* function of **soilwater** package (Cordano, Andreis, and Zottele 2017))

A *RasterList-class* object has been created and each cell contains a vector of soil water parameters:

A map of saturated water content (porosity) can be visualized as follows:

Let consider 3 points of interest in the Meuse located (latitude and logitude) as follows:

|------
|5.724514|50.96153|A|
|5.734514|50.96153|B|
|5.756814|50.98153|C|

<

They are indexed as follows in the raster map:

where *icell* is a vector of integer numbers corresponding to the raster cells containing the points A,B and C. Information on these points can be extracted as follows:

Using *swc* , a function that given the soil parameters returns a soil water function is defined:

And in case that it is applied to point A (i.e. setting the soil parameters of point A), it is:

where *scwA* is a function corresponding to the Soil Water Retention Curve in point A that can be plotted as follows:

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.milanor.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/soil_water_pressure-1024x731.png?w=450)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.milanor.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/soil_water_pressure-1024x731.png?w=450)
The procedure is replicated for all cells of the raster map, saving the soil water retention curves as an R object for all the cells, then making use of *rasterList* function:

The *RasterList-class* object contains each soil water retention curve per each cell. Since the list element referred to each raster cell are *function* class, *swc_rl* is coerced to a single function defined all raster extension through *rasterListFun* function:

In such a way, the function *swc_rlf* can be used to estimate to estimate soil water function given a spatially unimorm value of soil water pressure head ![](https://i2.wp.com/www.milanor.net/blog/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_a11bd56a0ff5973a5604bb3fc9142b1d.gif?w=456)

Conclusions
The above applications illustrate how statistical analysis and other processing may be replicated at every cell of a raster map. The **rasterList** package has been created to answer the need to make complex operation on spatially gridded region. The shown examples go beyond their own task but they have the task of presenting the most important functions of the package and how thay can be used to solve practical problems. **rasterList** is able to save different type of objects within a cell of the raster map and allows that each object of a raster cell may be transformed and/or coerced to another object. Two or more *RasterList-class* objects can interact through operations with one another. This is of great relevance because it allows to save intermediate steps during a processing workflow (e.g. statistical analysis).
