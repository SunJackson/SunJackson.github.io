Market basket analysis uses association rule mining under the hood to identifyproducts frequently bought together. Before we get into the nitty gritty ofmarket basket analysis, let us get a basic understanding of association rulemining. It finds association between different objects in a set. In the caseof market basket analysis, the objects are the products purchased by a cusomterand the set is the transaction. In short, market basket analysis

- is a unsupervised data mining technique

- that uncovers products frequently bought together

- and creates if-then scenario rules


## Why ?

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_why.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_why.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Market basket analysis creates actionable insights for:

- designing store layout

- online recommendation engines

- targeted marketing campaign/sales promotion/email campaign

- cross/up selling

- catalogue design


## Advantages

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_advantages.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Market basket analysisis is **cost effective** as data required is readilyavailable through electronic point of sale systems. It generates**actionable insights** for product placement, cross/up selling strategies,targeted marketing campaigns, catalogue design, pricing strategies,inventory control etc.

## Use Cases

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_use_cases.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Association rule mining has applications in several industries includingretail, telecommunications, banking, insurance, manufacturing and medical.Let us look at its applications in more detail in the following industries:

### Retail

The introduction of electronic point of sale systems have allowed thecollection of immense amounts of data and retail organizations make prolifcuse of market basket analysis for

- designing store layout so that consumers can more easily find items that arefrequently purchased together

- recommending associated products that are frequently bought together,**“Customers who purchased this product also viewed this product…”**

- emailing customers who bought products specific products with other productsand offers on those products that are likely to be interesting to them.

- grouping products that customers purchase frequently together in the store’sproduct placement

- designing special promotions that combine or discount certain products

- optimizing the layout of the catalog of an eCommerce site

- controlling inventory based on product demands and what products sell bettertogether


### Banks

Banks and financial institutions use market basket analysis to analyze creditcard purchases for fraud detection and cross sell insurance products,investment products (mutual funds etc.), tax preparation, retirement planning,wealth management etc. It can also be used for next best offer, sequence andseasonal offers.

## Simple Example

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_items_description.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Before we move on to the case study, let us use a simple example to understandthe important terminologies that we will come across in the rest of thetutorial. In the example, the transactions include the following products:

- mobile phones

- ear phones

- USB cable

- power bank

- screen guard

- mobile case cover

- modem/router

- mouse

- external hard drive


## Steps

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_steps.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_steps.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


The two important steps in market basket analysis are:

- frequent itemset generation

- rules generation


We will discuss these steps in more detail in the case study.

## Itemset

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_itemset.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_itemset.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Itemset is the collection of items purchased by a customer. In our example,mobile phone and screen guard are a frequent intemset. They are present in3 out of 5 transactions.

## Antecedent & Consequent

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_antecedent_consequent.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_antecedent_consequent.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Antecedent is the items of the left hand side of the rule and consequent isthe right hand side of the rule. In our example, mobile phone is the antecedentand screen guard is the consequent.

## Support

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_support.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_support.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Support is the probability of the antecedent event occuring. It is the relativefrequency of the itemset. If it is less than 50% then the association isconsidered less fruitful. In our example, support is the relative frequency oftransactions that include both mobile phone and screen guard.

## Confidence

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_confidence.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_confidence.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


Confidence is the probability the consequent will co-occur with the antecedent.It expresses the operational efficiency of the rule. In our example, it is theprobability that a customer will purchase screen guard provided that he hasalready bought the mobile phone.

## Data

Two public data sets are available for users to explore and learn market basketanalysis:

The groceries data set is available in the **arules** package as well. In thistutorial, we will use the UCI data set as it closely resembles real world datasets giving us a chance to reshape the data and restructure it in formatrequired by the **arules** package.

## Data Dictionary

- invoice number

- stock code

- description

- quantity

- invoice date

- unit price

- customer id

- country


## Libraries

```
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Preprocessing

This section is optional. You can skip to the **Read Data** section withoutany loss of continuity.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_pre_process.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_pre_process.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


As shown above, the data set has one row per item. We have created a tiny Rpackage mbar,for data pre-processing. It can be installed from GitHub as shown below:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsquaredacademy/mbar")
```

We will use `mbar_prep_data()` from the mbar package to reshape the data sothat there is one row per transaction with items across columns excludingthe column names.

```
library(mbar)
mba_data <- read_excel("online-retail.xlsx")
transactions <- mbar_prep_data(mba_data, InvoiceNo, Description)
head(transactions)
```

## EDA

Before we generate the rules using the **arules** package, let us explorethe data set a bit.

### How many items are purchased on an average?

```
items <- 
 mba_data %>%
 group_by(InvoiceNo) %>%
 summarize(count = n()) %>%
 pull(count) 

mean(items)
```

```
## [1] 20.92313
```

```
median(items)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

### Most Purchased Items

```
mba_data %>%
 group_by(Description) %>%
 summarize(count = n()) %>%
 arrange(desc(count))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4,212 x 2
## Description count
## 
## 1 WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER 2369
## 2 REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER 2200
## 3 JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT 2159
## 4 PARTY BUNTING 1727
## 5 LUNCH BAG RED RETROSPOT 1638
## 6 ASSORTED COLOUR BIRD ORNAMENT 1501
## 7 SET OF 3 CAKE TINS PANTRY DESIGN 1473
## 8 1454
## 9 PACK OF 72 RETROSPOT CAKE CASES 1385
## 10 LUNCH BAG BLACK SKULL. 1350
## # ... with 4,202 more rows
```

### Average Order Value

```
total_revenue <- 
 mba_data %>%
 group_by(InvoiceNo) %>%
 summarize(order_sum = sum(UnitPrice)) %>%
 pull(order_sum) %>%
 sum()

total_transactions <- 
 mba_data %>%
 group_by(InvoiceNo) %>%
 summarize(n()) %>%
 nrow()

total_revenue / total_transactions
```

```
## [1] 96.47892
```

## Read Data

It is now time to read data into R. We will use `read.transactions()`from **arules** package. The data cannot be read using `read.csv()` or`read_csv()` owing to the way it is structured. We will read the`transaction_data.csv` file as it contains the data we had modifiedin the previous step. We need to specify the following in order toread the data set:

- name of the data set within quotes (single or double)

- the format of the data, if each line represnts a transaction, use `basket`,and if each line represents an item in the transaction, use `single`

- the separator used to separate the items in a transaction


In our data set, each line represents a transaction and the items in thetransaction are separated by a `,`.

```
basket_data <- read.transactions("transaction_data.csv", format = "basket", 
 sep = ",")
basket_data
```

```
## transactions in sparse format with
## 25901 transactions (rows) and
## 10085 items (columns)
```

The `read.transactions()` function allows you to read data where each rowrepresents a item and not a transaction. In that case, the `format` argumentshould be set to the value `single` and the `cols` argument should specifythe names or positions of the columns that represent the **transaction id** and**item id**. We tried to read data in this way as well but failed to do so.However, the code is available below for other users to try and let us know ifyou find a way to get it to work or spot any mistakes we may have made.

```
get_data <- read.transactions("retail.csv", 
 format = "single",
 sep = ",",
 cols = c("InvoiceNo", "item"))
```

We were able to read the data when we removed the `sep` argument from the abovecode, but the result from the `summary()` function was way different than whatwe see in the next section i.e. it showed higher number of transactions anditems.

## Data Summary

To get a quick overview of the data, use `summary()`. It will return thefollowing:

- number of transactions

- number of items

- most frequent items

- distribution of items

- five number summary


```
summary(basket_data)
```

```

## Generate Rules

Finally, to the part you all have been waiting for, rules generation. The`apriori()` function is used for generating the rules. We will first learn thedifferent inputs that must be specified and later on play around with them andsee how the rules generated change.

The first input is the data set, which in our case is `basket_data`. Next, wewill supply the mining parameters using the `parameter` argument:

- `supp`: minimum **support** for an itemset

- `conf`: minimum **confidence**

- `maxlen`: maximum number of items the antecedent may include

- `target`: the type of association mined i.e. **rules**


The `parameter` argument takes several additional inputs but to get started, itis sufficient to know those mentioned above. All the inputs are supplied usinga `list()`.

For our case study, we will specify the following:

- support: 0.009

- confidence: 0.8

- maxlen: 4


Keep in mind, mining association rules with very low values for `support` willresult in a large number of rules being generated, resulting in long executiontime and the process will eventually run out of memory.

```
rules <- apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp=0.009, conf=0.8, 
 target = "rules", maxlen = 4))
```

```
## Apriori
## 
## Parameter specification:
## confidence minval smax arem aval originalSupport maxtime support minlen
## 0.8 0.1 1 none FALSE TRUE 5 0.009 1
## maxlen target ext
## 4 rules FALSE
## 
## Algorithmic control:
## filter tree heap memopt load sort verbose
## 0.1 TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE 2 TRUE
## Absolute minimum support count: 233 
## 
## set item appearances ...[0 item(s)] done [0.00s].
## set transactions ...[10085 item(s), 25901 transaction(s)] done [1.16s].
## sorting and recoding items ... [508 item(s)] done [0.03s].
## creating transaction tree ... done [0.05s].
## checking subsets of size 1 2 3 4
```

```
## Warning in apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp = 0.009, conf =
## 0.8, : Mining stopped (maxlen reached). Only patterns up to a length of 4
## returned!
```

```
## done [0.06s].
## writing ... [22 rule(s)] done [0.00s].
## creating S4 object ... done [0.02s].
```

Change the values of `supp`, `conf` and `maxlen`, and observe how the rulesgenerated change.

## Rules Summary

Once the rules have been generated by `apriori()`, we can use `summary()` toget some basic information such as rule length distribution.

```
summary(rules)
```

```
## set of 22 rules
## 
## rule length distribution (lhs + rhs):sizes
## 2 3 4 
## 11 9 2 
##

## 
## mining info:
## data ntransactions support confidence
## basket_data 25901 0.009 0.8
```

The output from `summary()` does not display the rules though. To view therules, we have to use `inspect()`.

## Inspect Rules

The `inspect()` function will display the rules along with:

- support

- confidence

- lift

- count


Before you inspect the rules, you can sort it by support, confidence orlift. In the below, output, we sort the rules by confidence in descending orderbefore inspecting them.

```
basket_rules <- sort(rules, by = 'confidence', decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(basket_rules[1:10])
```

```
## lhs rhs support confidence lift count
## [1] {BACK DOOR} => {KEY FOB} 0.009613528 1.0000000 61.23168 249

## Redundant & Non Redundant Rules

### Redundant Rules

A rule is redundant if a more general rules with the same or a higherconfidence exists. That is, a more specific rule is redundant if it is onlyequally or even less predictive than a more general rule. A rule is moregeneral if it has the same RHS but one or more items removed from the LHS.

#### Example 1

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_redundant_rule_1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_redundant_rule_1.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


In the above example, the first rule has the same support, condifence and liftas the next two rules. The second item in the left hand side of the rule is notadding any value and as such makes the rule redundant.

#### Example 2

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_redundant_rule_2.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_redundant_rule_2.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


In the above example, the first two rules have the same support, condifence andlift. The third rule differs only with respect to lift.

#### Example 3

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_redundant_rule_3.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_redundant_rule_3.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


In the above example, the first and third rule have the same support,condifence and lift. The second rule is different with respect to confidenceand lift.

Now that we have understood what redundant rules are and how to identify them,let us use the below R code to inspect them.

```
inspect(rules[is.redundant(rules)])
```

```
## lhs rhs support 
## [1] {SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA,SUGAR} => {COFFEE} 0.01436238
## [2] {COFFEE,SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA} => {SUGAR} 0.01436238
## [3] {COFFEE,SUGAR} => {SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA} 0.01436238
## confidence lift count
## [1] 1 55.94168 372 
## [2] 1 69.62634 372 
## [3] 1 69.62634 372
```

### Non-redundant Rules

Now let us look at the non-redundant rules.

```
inspect(rules[!is.redundant(rules)])
```

```

## What influenced purchase of product X?

So far, we have learnt how to generate, inspect and prune rules. Now, how dowe use these rules? To make business sense, we need to come up with a set ofrules that can be used either for product placement in physical stores oras recommendations in an online store or for targeted marketing via emailcampaigns etc. To achieve that, we need to know 2 things:

- what products influenced the purchase of product X?

- what purchases did product X influence?


For our case study, we can modify the above questions as:

#### What influenced the purchase of **sugar**?

To view the products which influenced the purchase of **sugar**, we willcontinue to use the `apriori()` function but add one more argument, `appearance`.It restricts the appearance of the items. Since we want the right hand side ofthe rules to have only one value, **sugar**, we will set the `rhs` argument to**sugar**. The left hand side of the rules should include all the products thatinfluenced the purchase of sugar i.e. it will exclude **sugar**. We will usethe `default` argument and supply it the value `lhs` i.e. all items excludingsugar can appear on the left hand side of the rule by default.

```
sugar_rules <- apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp = 0.009, conf = 0.8), 
 appearance = list(default = "lhs", rhs = "SUGAR")) 
```

```
## Apriori
## 
## Parameter specification:
## confidence minval smax arem aval originalSupport maxtime support minlen
## 0.8 0.1 1 none FALSE TRUE 5 0.009 1
## maxlen target ext
## 10 rules FALSE
## 
## Algorithmic control:
## filter tree heap memopt load sort verbose
## 0.1 TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE 2 TRUE
## Absolute minimum support count: 233 
## 
## set item appearances ...[1 item(s)] done [0.00s].
## set transactions ...[10085 item(s), 25901 transaction(s)] done [1.26s].
## sorting and recoding items ... [508 item(s)] done [0.03s].
## creating transaction tree ... done [0.05s].
## checking subsets of size 1 2 3 4 done [0.08s].
## writing ... [3 rule(s)] done [0.02s].
## creating S4 object ... done [0.01s].
```

```
rules_sugar <- sort(sugar_rules, by = "confidence", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(rules_sugar)
```

```
## lhs rhs support confidence lift 
## [1] {SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA} => {SUGAR} 0.01436238 1.0000000 69.62634
## [2] {COFFEE,SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA} => {SUGAR} 0.01436238 1.0000000 69.62634
## [3] {COFFEE} => {SUGAR} 0.01436238 0.8034557 55.94168
## count
## [1] 372 
## [2] 372 
## [3] 372
```

For the support and confidence we have mentioned, we know the followingproducts influenced the purchase of **sugar**:

- **COFFEE**

- **SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA**


## What purchases did product X influence?

Now that we know what products influenced the purchase of **sugar**, let usanswer the second question.

#### What purchases did **sugar** influence?

In this case, we want **sugar** to be on the left hand side of the rule and allthe products it influenced to be on the right hand side. We set the `lhs`argument to **sugar** and the `default` argument to `rhs` as all the products,the purchase of which was influenced by **sugar** should appear on the lefthand side of the rule by default.

```
sugar_rules <- apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp = 0.009, conf = 0.8), 
 appearance = list(default = "rhs", lhs = "SUGAR")) 
```

```
## Apriori
## 
## Parameter specification:
## confidence minval smax arem aval originalSupport maxtime support minlen
## 0.8 0.1 1 none FALSE TRUE 5 0.009 1
## maxlen target ext
## 10 rules FALSE
## 
## Algorithmic control:
## filter tree heap memopt load sort verbose
## 0.1 TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE 2 TRUE
## Absolute minimum support count: 233 
## 
## set item appearances ...[1 item(s)] done [0.00s].
## set transactions ...[10085 item(s), 25901 transaction(s)] done [1.25s].
## sorting and recoding items ... [508 item(s)] done [0.01s].
## creating transaction tree ... done [0.06s].
## checking subsets of size 1 2 done [0.02s].
## writing ... [2 rule(s)] done [0.00s].
## creating S4 object ... done [0.03s].
```

```
rules_sugar <- sort(sugar_rules, by = "confidence", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(rules_sugar)
```

```
## lhs rhs support confidence lift count
## [1] {SUGAR} => {SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA} 0.01436238 1 69.62634 372 
## [2] {SUGAR} => {COFFEE} 0.01436238 1 55.94168 372
```

For the support and confidence we have mentioned, we know the purchase ofthe following products were influenced by **sugar**:

- **COFFEE**

- **SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA**

## Visualization

To visualize the rules, the authors of **arules** have created a companionpackage, **arulesViz**. It offers several options for visualizing the rulesgenerated by `apriori()`.

### Scatter Plot

We can use the default `plot()` method to create a scatter plot. It will plotthe support on the `X` axis, the confidence on the `Y` axis and the lift isrepresented by the opaqueness/alpha of the color of the points.

```
plot(basket_rules)
```

### Network Plot

We can create a network plot using the `method` argument and supplying it thevalue `graph`. You can see the directionality of the rule in the below plot.For example, people who buy **shed** also buy **key fob** and similarly, peoplewho buy **back door** also buy **key fob**. It will be difficult to identifythe directionality of the rules when we are trying to plot too many rules.The `method` argument takes several other values as well.

```
plot(top_rules, method = 'graph')
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/post/2019-05-02-mba_files/figure-html/plot_network-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


## Things to keep in mind..

#### Directionality of rule is lost while using lift

The directionality of a rule is lost while using lift. In the below example,the lift is same for both the following rules:

- {Mobile Phone} => {Screen Guard}

- {Screen Guard} => {Mobile Phone}


It is clear that the lift is the same irrespective of the direction of the rule.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/mba_lift_warning_final.png?w=80%25&ssl=1)


#### Confidence as a measure can be misleading

If you look at the below example, the confidence for the second rule,**{Screen Guard} => {Mobile Phone}**, is greater than the first rule,**{Mobile Phone} => {Screen Guard}**. It does not mean that we can recommenda mobile phone to a customer who is purchasing a screen guard. It is importantto ensure that we do not use rules just because they have high confidenceassociated with them.

- uncovers products frequently bought together

- creates if-then scenario rules

- cost-effective, insightful and actionable

- association rule mining has applications in several industries

- directionality of rule is lost while using lift

- confidence as a measure can be misleading

Your knowledge of the domain/business matters a lot when you are trying touse market basket analysis. Especially, when you are trying to select orshortlist rules and use them for product placement in a store or forrecommending products online. It is a good practice to critically review therules before implementing them.
