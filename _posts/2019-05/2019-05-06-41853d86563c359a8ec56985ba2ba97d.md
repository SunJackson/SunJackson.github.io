**Learn to leverage data to gain a competitive business advantage.**



Penn State's 9-credit Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics can help you learn to perform analytics tasks in critical business areas, such as marketing, supply chain management, operations, and risk management.
 


This respected program, which can be completed part-time and online in as little as 12 months, explores how data can be leveraged to support business decisions through the complete spectrum of analytics activities:
 

- descriptive (what happened)

- diagnostic (why it happened)

- predictive (what will happen)

- prescriptive (what should happen)



 


You may apply successfully completed credits toward the requirements for the Master of Professional Studies in Data Analytics – Business Analytics option, should you decide to further your graduate education. A separate application is required. 


**Reminder: Applications for fall 2019 are due Monday, July 1.** We have experienced staff to help guide you through the application process, so feel free to contact us with any questions!
