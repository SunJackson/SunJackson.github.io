There are a million reasons to learn R (see e.g. Why R for data science – and not Python?), but where to start? I present to you the ultimate introduction to bring you up to speed! So read on…

I call it *ultimate* because it is the essence of many years of teaching R… or put differently: it is the kind of introduction I would have liked to have when I started out with R back in the days!

A word of warning though: this is a introduction to R and not to statistics, so I won’t explain the statistics terms used here. You do not need to know any other *programming language* but it does no harm either. Ok, now let us start!

First you need to install **R** (https://www.r-project.org) and preferably **RStudio** as a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*: https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop. Both are free and available for all common operating systems.

To get a quick overview of RStudio watch this video:



You can either type in the following commands in the *console* or open a new *script* tab (File -> New File -> R Script) and run the commands by pressing Ctrl + Enter/Return after having typed them.

First of all R is a very good *calculator*:

By the way: The hash is used for *comments*, everything after it will be ignored!

Of course you can define *variables* and use them in your calculations:

Part of R’s power stems from the fact that *functions* can handle several numbers at once, called *vectors*, and do calculations on them. When calling a function *arguments* are passed with round brackets:

In the last example the *12* was *recycled* three times. R always tries to do that (when feasible), sometimes giving a *warning* when it might not be intended:

In cases you only want parts of your vectors you can apply *subsetting* with square brackets:

*Ranges* can easily be created with the colon:

When you test whether this vector is bigger than a certain number you will get *logicals* as a result. You can use those logicals for subsetting:

Perhaps you have heard the story of little Gauss where his teacher gave him the task to add all numbers from *1* to *100* to keep him busy for a while? Well, he found a mathematical trick to add them within seconds… for us normal people we can use R:

When we want to use some code several times we can define our own function (a *user-defined function*). We do that the same way we create a vector (or any other *data structure*) because R is a so called *functional programming language* and functions are so called *first-class citizens* (i.e. on the same level as other data structures like vectors). The code that is being executed is put in curly brackets:

Of course we also have other data types, e.g. *matrices* are basically two dimensional vectors:

Subsetting now has to provide two numbers, the first for the *row*, the second for the *column*. If you leave one out, all data of the respective dimension will be shown:

Another possibility to create matrices:

*Naming* rows, here with inbuilt datasets:

When some result is **N**ot **A**vailable:

Getting the *structure* of your variables:

Another famous dataset (*iris*) that is also built into base R (to get help on any function or dataset just put the cursor in it and press *F1*):

Oops, that is a bit long… if you only want to show the first or last rows do the following:

Iris is a so called *data frame*, the working horse of R and data science (you will see how to create one below):

As you can see, data frames can combine different data types. If you try to do that with e.g. vectors, which can only hold one data type, something called *coercion* happens, i.e. at least one data type is forced to become another one so that consistency is maintained:

You can get a fast overview of your data like so:

As you have seen, R often runs a function on all of the data simultaneously. This feature is called *vectorization* and in many other languages you would need a *loop* for that. In R you don’t use loops that often, but of course they are available:

Speaking of *control structures*: of course *conditional statements* are available too:

Linear modelling (e.g. *correlation* and *linear regression*) couldn’t be any easier, it is included in the core language:

You could directly use the model to make predictions:

If you want to know more about the modelling process you can find it here: Learning Data Science: Modelling Basics

Another strength of R is the huge number of add-on *packages* for all kinds of specialized tasks. For the grand finale of this introduction, we’re gonna get a little taste of *machine learning*. For that matter we install the `OneR` package from *CRAN* (the official package repository of R): Tools -> Install packages… -> type in “OneR” -> click “Install”.

After that we build a simple model on the iris dataset to predict the *Species* column:

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/intRo3-840x600.png?w=450)


We’ll now see how well the model is doing:

*96% accuracy* is not too bad, even for this simple dataset!

If you want to know more about the OneR package you can read the *vignette*: OneR – Establishing a New Baseline for Machine Learning Classification Models.

Well, and that’s it for the ultimate introduction to R – hopefully you liked it and you learned something! Please share your first experiences with R in the comments and also if you miss something (I might add it in the future!) – Thank you for reading and stay tuned for more to come!
