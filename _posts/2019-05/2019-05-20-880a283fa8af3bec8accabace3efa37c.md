Chatbots represent one of the most successful products of applied Machine Learning (ML). While chatbots can’t yet fully replicate natural language comprehension, they offer 24x7 customer support and significant savings over traditional CSRs.

While they may seem complex to develop, you may be surprised to learn that implementing a fully-functioning chatbot is significantly cheaper than building a cross-platform app, and substantially less expensive than the human alternative (i.e., customer service reps).

Learn about the 3 different types of chatbots, benefits of each, and see how companies like Subway, Domino's and Starbucks are experimenting with chatbots. If you’d like to build your own, you can **create an out-of-the-box chatbot in just a few commands** on the ActiveState Platform.
