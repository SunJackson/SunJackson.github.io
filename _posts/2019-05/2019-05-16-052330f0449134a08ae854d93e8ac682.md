### 
Jobs: Several Postdocs in machine learning and information processing, LIONS, EPFL, Switzerland


Volkan just let me know of several openings:


Dear Igor,

I hope this email finds you well.

I would really appreciate it if you could advertise my postdoc position at NB.

best,=====

Here is the announcement:


The LIONS group at EPFL has several openings for postdoctoral fellows for research in machine learning and information processing. Please see our research interests athttps://lions.epfl.ch.

We are looking for candidates with a strong theory background in machine learning, discrete optimization, information theory, statistics, compressive sensing, or other related areas. Strong coding skills is a big plus.There are two positions that revolve around the following two topics:

1) Bayesian optimization, bandits, and reinforcement learningWe seek to develop online algorithms for Bayesian optimization, as well as related problems such as multi-armed bandits, level-set estimation, and reinforcement learning. The algorithms will be characterized theoretically, and also tested in real-world applications including automated hyperparameter optimization with neural networks and personalized education.2) Discrete optimization and submodularity with applications to subsamplingWe seek to develop techniques for discrete optimization, with submodularity and related concepts playing a key role. These techniques will be targeted at the application of using data in order to optimally subsample for the purpose of performing a given task, such as estimation in compressive sensing or classification in machine learning. Specific applications will also be explored, including medical resonance imaging (MRI) with multiple coils.3) Continuous optimization theory and methodologyWe seek to develop gradient and linear minimization oracle based algorithms for convex and non-convex problems. In particular, we are interested in the marriage of online and offline optimization, universal adaptation, and storage optimal solutions to difficult training problems that range from semidefinite programming to neural network training.

LIONS provides a stimulating, collaborative and fun research environment with state-of-the-art facilities at EPFL. Personal initiative and independent research tasks related with the candidate’s interests are also encouraged.The working language at EPFL is English.Candidates should have or be close to finishing a PhD degree in electrical engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, or a related field. Candidates should send their CV, a research statement outlining their expertise and interests, any supplemental information, and a list of at least three references with full contact information to the LIONS Lab Administrator:Gosia Baltaian (gosia.baltaian@epfl.ch)======
