With the arrival of summer, another TokyoR UserMeetup! On May 25th, useRsfrom all over Tokyo (and some even from further afield – including KanNishida of Exploratory, all the way fromCalifornia!) flocked to Jimbocho, Tokyo for another jam-packed sessionof R hosted by Mitsui Sumitomo InsuranceGroup.

Like my previous round up posts (for TokyoR#76 andTokyoR #77) I will begoing over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will helpspread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community.Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from othersources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of acertain talk. You can follow **Tokyo.R** by searching for the#TokyoR hashtag on Twitter.

Unlike most R Meetups a lot of people present using just their Twitterhandles so I’ll mostly be referring to them by those instead. I’ve beengoing to events here in Japan for a bit over a year but even nowsometimes I’m like, “Whoahh that’s what`@very_recognizable_twitter_handle_in_the_japan_r_community` actuallylooks like?!”

Anyways…

Let’s get started!

As with every TokyoR meetup, we beganwith a set of beginner user focused talks:

## tanakafreelance: Radiant for Data Analysis!

`@tanakafreelance` talked aboutRadiant, which is aplatform-independent browser-based GUI for business analytics that wasdeveloped by Vincent Nijs. It is a tool for business analyticspurposes and is based on `Shiny`. After installation from CRAN you canlaunch it via using `radiant::launcher()`. Most of this presentation wasa live demo by `@tanakafreelance` showing a lot of the functionalityoffered by Radiant such as creating reproducible reports with RMarkdown, writing your own R code to use within the GUI, creating andevaluating models (linear/logistic regression, neural networks, naiveBayes, and more), and design of experiments (DOE)!

You can run it from a variety of set ups from online, offline, on`shinyapps.io`, Shiny server, and even on a cloud service like AWS via acustomized Docker container. For a comprehensive introduction toRadiant’s full capabilities you can check out its awesome websitehere, full of videosand vignettes!

## kotaku08: Transitioning a Company to Use R!

`@kotaku08` talked about his experiences in data analytics and ways hepushed for the usage of R at his company, VALUES. One of the firstthings he realized upon entering the company was how the skill set ofthe team was more of that of data/system engineers rather than dataanalysts. After some time he found three big problems with his workingenvironment that he wanted to solve:

Mismatch between the tool used and the task needed done

1. easy data manipulation with PHP.

1. complicated data manipulation with Excel.



What was this again?! (Illegible! Non-reproducible! Non-reusable!)

1. Extremely convoluted Excel formulas that look like they could bebanned by the `Malleus Maleficarum`.

1. Excel sheets only contain the **results**.

1. If it was a visualization task, it was all done in Tableau…



Data extraction being a painful process…

1. Connecting to `Redshift` is a pain!




- Extremely convoluted Excel formulas that look like they could bebanned by the `Malleus Maleficarum`.

- Excel sheets only contain the **results**.

- If it was a visualization task, it was all done in Tableau…


While pondering these problems, he came across thisarticlefrom AirBnB that highlighted their transition to building R tools andteaching R across the company. The key takeaways that `@kotaku08` tookfrom the article was:

- Most analysts at AirBnB use R.

- Intracompany package: `Rbnb`.

- Efforts put into R education and conducting workshops.

- Data analysis is both efficient AND reproducible!


Taking these lessons to heart he decided to implement #rstats learningsessions as well as create a company R package! One of the mainfunctionalities of VALUES’ main R package is being able to access datafrom Redshift and in tandem with the various packages in the `cloudyr`project has made getting data much more easier for `@kotaku08` and histeam.

Another big step was educating fellow employees about #rstats.

For **existing** employees:

1. Spread rumors about how accessing data is much easier with R…

1. Those skilled in other scripting languages organically come over tocheck R out!


For **new** employees:

- Emphasize how R is **THE** standard at the company,

- “Graduate hires”, most of whom have no programming experience, areput into R boot camps

- After 3 months of hard work, able to use the `tidyverse` foranalytical tasks!


As a result of these efforts 80% of employees can now use R and theinternal company package has two new maintainers (both graduate hires!)to work alongside `kotaku08`.

## tomkxy: Making Your Code Faster – Introduction to Vectorisation and Parallel Computing (English with demonstrations)

`@tomkxy` presented in English (he’s a Kiwi that works for RIKEN!) onvectorizing your code and parallel computing with R. In response to alot of the accusations that “R is slow”, Tom talked about differenttechniques to use to make your R code faster along with some somedemonstrations (the RMD can be foundhere).

One of my key take-aways from this talk was, “Code first, optimizelater!”. In that it’s important to not get stuck doing prematureoptimization, especially if you might not actually need to use the codeagain anyways! Also, sometimes parallel computing may not always be thefastest solution due to overhead costs associated with setting upclusters and communication between clusters.

In addition, the newly developed “Jobs” pane in RStudio 1.2, releasedlast month,means you can keep being productive even while you have your scriptsrunning in the background. A great resource for those interested is theCRAN Task View for high performance and parallel computing availablehere.

## ill_identified: Guide to MCMC with the `bayesplot` package!

`@ill_identified` presented on using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)with R, specifically using the `bayesplot` package. MCMC are a series ofmethods that contain algorithms for sampling from a probabilitydistribution. These methods involve drawing random samples from a targetdistributions using algorithms (such as Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,reversible jump, HMC, etc.) then we attempt to construct a Markov chainsuch that its equilibrium probability distribution is as close to ourtarget distribution as possible by iterating the chain many times.

As I’m not familiar with MCMC very much I won’t go into too much detailhere, however for others unfamiliar with MCMC and Bayesianinference,`@ill_identified` provided a nice list of books to get youstarted:

Just recently TJ Mahr, one of the authorsof `bayesplot`, presented on the package at Chicago SatRDays. You cancheck the slides outhere. The new versionof `bayesplot`, 1.7.0, will also support tidyselect:

## Atsushi776: May I `felp` you?

`@Atsushi776`, known in the Japanese R Community for his “headphones”avatar, created a new package calledfelp as he was annoyed that he couldn’tlook at the source code while looking at the help files of a function.Also there was the added annoyance of having to jump back to the startof the function to type `?` back in AND deleting it once you’re done.

```
source("https://install-github.me/atusy/felp")
library(felp)
library(printr)

## From this:
?help()

## To this:
help?
## Alternatively:
felp(help)
felp("help")

## Source code is nicely highlighted by `prettycode`:
## Output shortened for brevity...
grep()?.

```

```
## function (pattern, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE, value = FALSE, 
## fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE, invert = FALSE) 
## {
## if (!is.character(x)) 
## x <- structure(as.character(x), names = names(x))
## .Internal(grep(as.character(pattern), x, ignore.case, value, 
## perl, fixed, useBytes, invert))
## }
## 
## 

## Pattern Matching and Replacement
## Description:
## 
## 'grep', 'grepl', 'regexpr', 'gregexpr' and 'regexec' search for
## matches to argument 'pattern' within each element of a character
## vector: they differ in the format of and amount of detail in the
## results.
## 
## 'sub' and 'gsub' perform replacement of the first and all matches
## respectively.
## Usage:
## 
## grep(pattern, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE, value = FALSE,
## fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE, invert = FALSE)
## 
## grepl(pattern, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE,
## fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)
## 
## sub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE,
## fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)
## 
## gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE,
## fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)

```

Short for **f** unctional h **elp**, he got this to work by modifyingthe `?` operator to show the inner structure of a function along withthe help page. This works for both a function as seen above and onpackages by `package_name?p`. You can also use the `?` on data setobjects to return what you’ll normally get from a `str()` call inaddition the the help page.

```
iris?. ## also opens "Help" page for the dataset

```

```
## 'data.frame': 150 obs. of 5 variables:
## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

## Edgar Anderson's Iris Data
## Description:
## 
## This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the
## measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and
## width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers
## from each of 3 species of iris. The species are _Iris setosa_,
## _versicolor_, and _virginica_.
## Usage:
## 
## iris
## iris3
## Format:
## 
## 'iris' is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables
## (columns) named 'Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length',
## 'Petal.Width', and 'Species'.
## 
## 'iris3' gives the same data arranged as a 3-dimensional array of
## size 50 by 4 by 3, as represented by S-PLUS. The first dimension
## gives the case number within the species subsample, the second the
## measurements with names 'Sepal L.', 'Sepal W.', 'Petal L.', and
## 'Petal W.', and the third the species.
## Source:
## 
## Fisher, R. A. (1936) The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic
## problems. _Annals of Eugenics_, *7*, Part II, 179-188.
## 
## The data were collected by Anderson, Edgar (1935). The irises of
## the Gaspe Peninsula, _Bulletin of the American Iris Society_,
## *59*, 2-5.
## References:
## 
## Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R. (1988) _The New S
## Language_. Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole. (has 'iris3' as 'iris'.)
## See Also:
## 'matplot' some examples of which use 'iris'.
## Examples:
## 
## dni3 <- dimnames(iris3)
## ii <- data.frame(matrix(aperm(iris3, c(1,3,2)), ncol = 4,
## dimnames = list(NULL, sub(" L.",".Length",
## sub(" W.",".Width", dni3[[2]])))),
## Species = gl(3, 50, labels = sub("S", "s", sub("V", "v", dni3[[3]]))))
## all.equal(ii, iris) # TRUE

```

In the near future `@Atsushi776` wants to get rid of not just the `.`but the `?` altogether and wants to work on using a prefix `p?` in frontof the package name to bring up the documentation for an entire package.Go `felp` yourself by taking a look at the packagewebsite!

## 0_u0: Marketing Science & R!

`@0_u0` (better known as `きぬいと` or `Kinuito`) talked about hissuccessful attempt to integrate R into his workflow at the marketingdepartment of a very non-technical traditional Japanese company.

Most of the work being done for customers by his company is**descriptive** statistics. Nothing fancy or A.I. or even simple linearregression. As such, a lot of the problems that are given to hisdepartment can be solved by tables and `ggplot`s. As a consequence hehad been fighting an uphill battle as the company standard is to justuse Excel for … well literally everything.

Trying to find some way to incorporate R and Python to make his workfloweasier `Kinuito` started using the `tidyverse` to simplify the datacleaning processes!

Key takeaways:

- Reduce overtime by using the `tidyverse` to automatea lot of the grunt work involved with cleaning and transformingmarketing data.

- Not have to open up extraordinarily large Excel files (as much asbefore…).

- Great success in using `ggplot2` and `DiagrammeR` for creatinginformative output.

- Start with descriptive statistics, you can’t do anything moreadvanced unless you have the infrastructure to do so!


`Kinuito` also highlighted some things he wanted to do in the nearfuture:

- Document R and Python tips for new graduate hires using R Markdown!

Consolidate the company’s R environment:

- Currently version control is a mess as everybody is still onlyworking in their own local environments.

- Solution: Docker?


Along with `@kotaku08`’s talk it was great to get more insight into howR is used at various companies. I’ve personally only heard things froman American or English company’s point of view (from the various Rconferences/meetups I’ve been to) so it was nice to hear about thedifferences and similarities in the challenges faced by Japanesecorporations at this month’s `TokyoR`!

Following all of the talks, those who were staying for the after-partywere served sushi and drinks! With a loud rendition of “kampai!”(cheers!) R users from all over Tokyo began to talk about theirsuccesses and struggles with R. A fun tradition at `TokyoR` is a**Rock-Paper-Scissors** tournament with the prize being free datascience books!

The prize for this month was:

`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle withJapanese R users as it’s the largest regular meetup here in Japan. Talksin English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
