 Two editions of Why R? conferences were a great networking success. We gather 200-300 R enthusiasts from Europe during each edition and were able to host more than 25 workshops together. The hunger for a bigger event led us to the 3rd edition!

We are more than happy to announce that Why R? 2019 Conference will be organized by Why R? Foundation. The third official meeting of Polish R enthusiasts will be held in Warsaw 26-29 September 2019. As the meeting is held in English, we are happy to invite R users from other countries.
