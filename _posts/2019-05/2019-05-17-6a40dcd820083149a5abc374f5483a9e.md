### Introduction - Graphs are meant to be seen

By helping surface information, visualization tools create a bridge between graph data and viewers. Graph libraries are an important layer of the graph technology landscape. They let you build custom visualization application for network data and you can pick from a large catalog depending on your favorite language, license requirement, budget or project needs.

In the open-source world, some libraries offer many possibilities for data visualization, including graph, or network, representations. Other libraries solely focus on network diagram representations. Usually, these libraries provide more features than the generalist ones. You will also find commercial graph visualization libraries. The commercial libraries have the advantage of guaranteeing continuous technical support and advanced performances.
