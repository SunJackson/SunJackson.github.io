**Topic Classification Method for Analyzing Effect of eWOM on Consumer Game Sales**

Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has become an important resource for the analysis of marketing research. In this study, in order to analyze user needs for consumer game software, we focus on tweet data. And we proposed topic extraction method using entropy-based feature selection based feature expansion. We also applied it to the classification of the data extracted from tweet data by using SVM. As a result, we achieved a 0.63 F-measure.

**Survey of Dropout Methods for Deep Neural Networks**

Dropout methods are a family of stochastic techniques used in neural network training or inference that have generated significant research interest and are widely used in practice. They have been successfully applied in neural network regularization, model compression, and in measuring the uncertainty of neural network outputs. While original formulated for dense neural network layers, recent advances have made dropout methods also applicable to convolutional and recurrent neural network layers. This paper summarizes the history of dropout methods, their various applications, and current areas of research interest. Important proposed methods are described in additional detail.

**Robust subspace clustering by Cauchy loss function**

Subspace clustering is a problem of exploring the low-dimensional subspaces of high-dimensional data. State-of-the-arts approaches are designed by following the model of spectral clustering based method. These methods pay much attention to learn the representation matrix to construct a suitable similarity matrix and overlook the influence of the noise term on subspace clustering. However, the real data are always contaminated by the noise and the noise usually has a complicated statistical distribution. To alleviate this problem, we in this paper propose a subspace clustering method based on Cauchy loss function (CLF). Particularly, it uses CLF to penalize the noise term for suppressing the large noise mixed in the real data. This is due to that the CLF’s influence function has a upper bound which can alleviate the influence of a single sample, especially the sample with a large noise, on estimating the residuals. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the grouping effect of our proposed method, which means that highly correlated data can be grouped together. Finally, experimental results on five real datasets reveal that our proposed method outperforms several representative clustering methods.

**Synthetic Data Generation and Adaption for Object Detection in Smart Vending Machines**

This paper presents an improved scheme for the generation and adaption of synthetic images for the training of deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) to perform the object detection task in smart vending machines. While generating synthetic data has proved to be effective for complementing the training data in supervised learning methods, challenges still exist for generating virtual images which are similar to those of the complex real scenes and minimizing redundant training data. To solve these problems, we consider the simulation of cluttered objects placed in a virtual scene and the wide-angle camera with distortions used to capture the whole scene in the data generation process, and post-processed the generated images with a elaborately-designed generative network to make them more similar to the real images. Various experiments have been conducted to prove the efficiency of using the generated virtual images to enhance the detection precision on existing datasets with limited real training data and the generalization ability of applying the trained network to datasets collected in new environment.

**Real numbers, data science and chaos: How to fit any dataset with a single parameter**

We show how any dataset of any modality (time-series, images, sound…) can be approximated by a well-behaved (continuous, differentiable…) scalar function with a single real-valued parameter. Building upon elementary concepts from chaos theory, we adopt a pedagogical approach demonstrating how to adjust this parameter in order to achieve arbitrary precision fit to all samples of the data. Targeting an audience of data scientists with a taste for the curious and unusual, the results presented here expand on previous similar observations regarding expressiveness power and generalization of machine learning models.

**An approach to image denoising using manifold approximation without clean images**

Image restoration has been an extensively researched topic in numerous fields. With the advent of deep learning, a lot of the current algorithms were replaced by algorithms that are more flexible and robust. Deep networks have demonstrated impressive performance in a variety of tasks like blind denoising, image enhancement, deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, among others. Most of these learning-based algorithms use a large amount of clean data during the training process. However, in certain applications in medical image processing, one may not have access to a large amount of clean data. In this paper, we propose a method for denoising that attempts to learn the denoising process by pushing the noisy data close to the clean data manifold, using only noisy images during training. Furthermore, we use perceptual loss terms and an iterative refinement step to further refine the clean images without losing important features.

**OPIEC: An Open Information Extraction Corpus**

Open information extraction (OIE) systems extract relations and their arguments from natural language text in an unsupervised manner. The resulting extractions are a valuable resource for downstream tasks such as knowledge base construction, open question answering, or event schema induction. In this paper, we release, describe, and analyze an OIE corpus called OPIEC, which was extracted from the text of English Wikipedia. OPIEC complements the available OIE resources: It is the largest OIE corpus publicly available to date (over 340M triples) and contains valuable metadata such as provenance information, confidence scores, linguistic annotations, and semantic annotations including spatial and temporal information. We analyze the OPIEC corpus by comparing its content with knowledge bases such as DBpedia or YAGO, which are also based on Wikipedia. We found that most of the facts between entities present in OPIEC cannot be found in DBpedia and/or YAGO, that OIE facts often differ in the level of specificity compared to knowledge base facts, and that OIE open relations are generally highly polysemous. We believe that the OPIEC corpus is a valuable resource for future research on automated knowledge base construction.

**Domain Agnostic Learning with Disentangled Representations**

Unsupervised model transfer has the potential to greatly improve the generalizability of deep models to novel domains. Yet the current literature assumes that the separation of target data into distinct domains is known as a priori. In this paper, we propose the task of Domain-Agnostic Learning (DAL): How to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to unlabeled data from arbitrary target domains? To tackle this problem, we devise a novel Deep Adversarial Disentangled Autoencoder (DADA) capable of disentangling domain-specific features from class identity. We demonstrate experimentally that when the target domain labels are unknown, DADA leads to state-of-the-art performance on several image classification datasets.

**LeGR: Filter Pruning via Learned Global Ranking**

**Low-Rank Principal Eigenmatrix Analysis**

Sparse PCA is a widely used technique for high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method called low-rank principal eigenmatrix analysis. Different from sparse PCA, the dominant eigenvectors are allowed to be dense but are assumed to have a low-rank structure when matricized appropriately. Such a structure arises naturally in several practical cases: Indeed the top eigenvector of a circulant matrix, when matricized appropriately is a rank-1 matrix. We propose a matricized rank-truncated power method that could be efficiently implemented and establish its computational and statistical properties. Extensive experiments on several synthetic data sets demonstrate the competitive empirical performance of our method.

**Counterexample-Driven Synthesis for Probabilistic Program Sketches**

Probabilistic programs are key to deal with uncertainty in e.g. controller synthesis. They are typically small but intricate. Their development is complex and error prone requiring quantitative reasoning over a myriad of alternative designs. To mitigate this complexity, we adopt counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) to automatically synthesise finite-state probabilistic programs. Our approach leverages efficient model checking, modern SMT solving, and counterexample generation at program level. Experiments on practically relevant case studies show that design spaces with millions of candidate designs can be fully explored using a few thousand verification queries.

**Conditional Teacher-Student Learning**

The teacher-student (T/S) learning has been shown to be effective for a variety of problems such as domain adaptation and model compression. One shortcoming of the T/S learning is that a teacher model, not always perfect, sporadically produces wrong guidance in form of posterior probabilities that misleads the student model towards a suboptimal performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a conditional T/S learning scheme, in which a ‘smart’ student model selectively chooses to learn from either the teacher model or the ground truth labels conditioned on whether the teacher can correctly predict the ground truth. Unlike a naive linear combination of the two knowledge sources, the conditional learning is exclusively engaged with the teacher model when the teacher model’s prediction is correct, and otherwise backs off to the ground truth. Thus, the student model is able to learn effectively from the teacher and even potentially surpass the teacher. We examine the proposed learning scheme on two tasks: domain adaptation on CHiME-3 dataset and speaker adaptation on Microsoft short message dictation dataset. The proposed method achieves 9.8% and 12.8% relative word error rate reductions, respectively, over T/S learning for environment adaptation and speaker-independent model for speaker adaptation.

**Attentive Adversarial Learning for Domain-Invariant Training**

Adversarial domain-invariant training (ADIT) proves to be effective in suppressing the effects of domain variability in acoustic modeling and has led to improved performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In ADIT, an auxiliary domain classifier takes in equally-weighted deep features from a deep neural network (DNN) acoustic model and is trained to improve their domain-invariance by optimizing an adversarial loss function. In this work, we propose an attentive Adversarial domain-invariant training (AADIT) in which we advance the domain classifier with an attention mechanism to automatically weight the input deep features according to their importance in domain classification. With this attentive re-weighting, AADIT can focus on the domain normalization of phonetic components that are more susceptible to domain variability and generates deep features with improved domain-invariance and senone-discriminativity over ADIT. Most importantly, the attention block serves only as an external component to the DNN acoustic model and is not involved in ASR, so AADIT can be used to improve the acoustic modeling with any DNN architectures. More generally, the same methodology can improve any adversarial learning system with an auxiliary discriminator. Evaluated on CHiME-3 dataset, the AADIT achieves 13.6% and 9.3% relative WER improvements, respectively, over a multi-conditional model and a strong ADIT baseline.

**A convolution recurrent autoencoder for spatio-temporal missing data imputation**

When sensors collect spatio-temporal data in a large geographical area, the existence of missing data cannot be escaped. Missing data negatively impacts the performance of data analysis and machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we study deep autoencoders for missing data imputation in spatio-temporal problems. We propose a convolution bidirectional-LSTM for capturing spatial and temporal patterns. Moreover, we analyze an autoencoder’s latent feature representation in spatio-temporal data and illustrate its performance for missing data imputation. Traffic flow data are used for evaluation of our models. The result shows that the proposed convolution recurrent neural network outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

**Challenges and Pitfalls of Reproducing Machine Learning Artifacts**

An increasingly complex and diverse collection of Machine Learning(ML) models as well as hardware/software stacks, collectively referred to as ‘ML artifacts’, are being proposed – leading to a diverse landscape of ML. These ML innovations proposed have outpaced researchers’ ability to analyze, study and adapt them. This is exacerbated by the complicated and sometimes non-reproducible procedures for ML evaluation. The current practice of sharing ML artifacts is through repositories where artifact authors post ad-hoc code and some documentation. The authors often fail to reveal critical information for others to reproduce their results. One often fails to reproduce artifact authors’ claims, not to mention adapt the model to his/her own use. This article discusses the common challenges and pitfalls of reproducing ML artifacts, which can be used as a guideline for ML researchers when sharing or reproducing artifacts.

**Dynamic Learning with Frequent New Product Launches: A Sequential Multinomial Logit Bandit Problem**

Motivated by the phenomenon that companies introduce new products to keep abreast with customers’ rapidly changing tastes, we consider a novel online learning setting where a profit-maximizing seller needs to learn customers’ preferences through offering recommendations, which may contain existing products and new products that are launched in the middle of a selling period. We propose a sequential multinomial logit (SMNL) model to characterize customers’ behavior when product recommendations are presented in tiers. For the offline version with known customers’ preferences, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm and characterize the properties of the optimal tiered product recommendation. For the online problem, we propose a learning algorithm and quantify its regret bound. Moreover, we extend the setting to incorporate a constraint which ensures every new product is learned to a given accuracy. Our results demonstrate the tier structure can be used to mitigate the risks associated with learning new products.

**Self-Attention Capsule Networks for Image Classification**

We propose a novel architecture for image classification, called Self-Attention Capsule Networks (SACN). SACN is the first model that incorporates the Self-Attention mechanism as an integral layer within the Capsule Network (CapsNet). While the Self-Attention mechanism selects the more dominant image regions to focus on, the CapsNet analyzes the relevant features and their spatial correlations inside these regions only. The features are extracted in the convolutional layer. Then, the Self-Attention layer learns to suppress irrelevant regions based on features analysis, and highlights salient features useful for a specific task. The attention map is then fed into the CapsNet primary layer that is followed by a classification layer. The SACN proposed model was designed to use a relatively shallow CapsNet architecture to reduce computational load, and compensates for the absence of a deeper network by using the Self-Attention module to significantly improve the results. The proposed Self-Attention CapsNet architecture was extensively evaluated on five different datasets, mainly on three different medical sets, in addition to the natural MNIST and SVHN. The model was able to classify images and their patches with diverse and complex backgrounds better than the baseline CapsNet. As a result, the proposed Self-Attention CapsNet significantly improved classification performance within and across different datasets and outperformed the baseline CapsNet not only in classification accuracy but also in robustness.

**Logician: A Unified End-to-End Neural Approach for Open-Domain Information Extraction**

In this paper, we consider the problem of open information extraction (OIE) for extracting entity and relation level intermediate structures from sentences in open-domain. We focus on four types of valuable intermediate structures (Relation, Attribute, Description, and Concept), and propose a unified knowledge expression form, SAOKE, to express them. We publicly release a data set which contains more than forty thousand sentences and the corresponding facts in the SAOKE format labeled by crowd-sourcing. To our knowledge, this is the largest publicly available human labeled data set for open information extraction tasks. Using this labeled SAOKE data set, we train an end-to-end neural model using the sequenceto-sequence paradigm, called Logician, to transform sentences into facts. For each sentence, different to existing algorithms which generally focus on extracting each single fact without concerning other possible facts, Logician performs a global optimization over all possible involved facts, in which facts not only compete with each other to attract the attention of words, but also cooperate to share words. An experimental study on various types of open domain relation extraction tasks reveals the consistent superiority of Logician to other states-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments verify the reasonableness of SAOKE format, the valuableness of SAOKE data set, the effectiveness of the proposed Logician model, and the feasibility of the methodology to apply end-to-end learning paradigm on supervised data sets for the challenging tasks of open information extraction.

**Technical Debt Prioritization: State of the Art. A Systematic Literature Review**

Background. Software companies need to manage and refactor Technical Debt issues. Therefore, it is necessary to understand if and when refactoring Technical Debt should be prioritized with respect to developing features or fixing bugs. \\ Objective. The goal of this study is to investigate the existing body of knowledge in software engineering to understand what Technical Debt prioritization approaches have been proposed in research and industry. Method. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review among 384 unique papers published until 2018, following a consolidated methodology applied in Software Engineering. We included 38 primary studies. Results. Different approaches have been proposed for Technical Debt prioritization, all having different goals and optimizing on different criteria. The proposed measures capture only a small part of the plethora of factors used to prioritize Technical Debt qualitatively in practice. We report an impact map of such factors. However, there is a lack of empirical and validated set of tools. Conclusion. We observed that technical Debt prioritization research is preliminary and there is no consensus on what are the important factors and how to measure them. Consequently, we cannot consider current research conclusive and in this paper, we outline different directions for necessary future investigations.

**A Survey of Community Search Over Big Graphs**

With the rapid development of information technologies, various big graphs are prevalent in many real applications (e.g., social media and knowledge bases). An important component of these graphs is the network community. Essentially, a community is a group of vertices which are densely connected internally. Community retrieval can be used in many real applications, such as event organization, friend recommendation, and so on. Consequently, how to efficiently find high-quality communities from big graphs is an important research topic in the era of big data. Recently a large group of research works, called community search, have been proposed. They aim to provide efficient solutions for searching high-quality communities from large networks in real-time. Nevertheless, these works focus on different types of graphs and formulate communities in different manners, and thus it is desirable to have a comprehensive review of these works. In this survey, we conduct a thorough review of existing community search works. Moreover, we analyze and compare the quality of communities under their models, and the performance of different solutions. Furthermore, we point out new research directions. This survey does not only help researchers to have a better understanding of existing community search solutions, but also provides practitioners a better judgment on choosing the proper solutions.

**ConvTimeNet: A Pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Time Series Classification**

Training deep neural networks often requires careful hyper-parameter tuning and significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose ConvTimeNet (CTN): an off-the-shelf deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on diverse univariate time series classification (TSC) source tasks. Once trained, CTN can be easily adapted to new TSC target tasks via a small amount of fine-tuning using labeled instances from the target tasks. We note that the length of convolutional filters is a key aspect when building a pre-trained model that can generalize to time series of different lengths across datasets. To achieve this, we incorporate filters of multiple lengths in all convolutional layers of CTN to capture temporal features at multiple time scales. We consider all 65 datasets with time series of lengths up to 512 points from the UCR TSC Benchmark for training and testing transferability of CTN: We train CTN on a randomly chosen subset of 24 datasets using a multi-head approach with a different softmax layer for each training dataset, and study generalizability and transferability of the learned filters on the remaining 41 TSC datasets. We observe significant gains in classification accuracy as well as computational efficiency when using pre-trained CTN as a starting point for subsequent task-specific fine-tuning compared to existing state-of-the-art TSC approaches. We also provide qualitative insights into the working of CTN by: i) analyzing the activations and filters of first convolution layer suggesting the filters in CTN are generically useful, ii) analyzing the impact of the design decision to incorporate multiple length decisions, and iii) finding regions of time series that affect the final classification decision via occlusion sensitivity analysis.

**Semantic Matching of Documents from Heterogeneous Collections: A Simple and Transparent Method for Practical Applications**

We present a very simple, unsupervised method for the pairwise matching of documents from heterogeneous collections. We demonstrate our method with the Concept-Project matching task, which is a binary classification task involving pairs of documents from heterogeneous collections. Although our method only employs standard resources without any domain- or task-specific modifications, it clearly outperforms the more complex system of the original authors. In addition, our method is transparent, because it provides explicit information about how a similarity score was computed, and efficient, because it is based on the aggregation of (pre-computable) word-level similarities.

**Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search: Bridging the Depth Gap between Search and Evaluation**

**Toward a principled Bayesian workflow in cognitive science**

Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. However, the utility of Bayesian methods ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst’s domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To accomplish this, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

**A Review of Modularization Techniques in Artificial Neural Networks**

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved significant success in tackling classical and modern machine learning problems. As learning problems grow in scale and complexity, and expand into multi-disciplinary territory, a more modular approach for scaling ANNs will be needed. Modular neural networks (MNNs) are neural networks that embody the concepts and principles of modularity. MNNs adopt a large number of different techniques for achieving modularization. Previous surveys of modularization techniques are relatively scarce in their systematic analysis of MNNs, focusing mostly on empirical comparisons and lacking an extensive taxonomical framework. In this review, we aim to establish a solid taxonomy that captures the essential properties and relationships of the different variants of MNNs. Based on an investigation of the different levels at which modularization techniques act, we attempt to provide a universal and systematic framework for theorists studying MNNs, also trying along the way to emphasise the strengths and weaknesses of different modularization approaches in order to highlight good practices for neural network practitioners.

**Graph Matching Networks for Learning the Similarity of Graph Structured Objects**

This paper addresses the challenging problem of retrieval and matching of graph structured objects, and makes two key contributions. First, we demonstrate how Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which have emerged as an effective model for various supervised prediction problems defined on structured data, can be trained to produce embedding of graphs in vector spaces that enables efficient similarity reasoning. Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching Network model that, given a pair of graphs as input, computes a similarity score between them by jointly reasoning on the pair through a new cross-graph attention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on different domains including the challenging problem of control-flow-graph based function similarity search that plays an important role in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental analysis demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in the context of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain-specific baseline systems that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.

**Relational Collaborative Filtering:Modeling Multiple Item Relations for Recommendation**

Existing item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) methods leverage only the relation of collaborative similarity. Nevertheless, there exist multiple relations between items in real-world scenarios. Distinct from the collaborative similarity that implies co-interact patterns from the user perspective, these relations reveal fine-grained knowledge on items from different perspectives of meta-data, functionality, etc. However, how to incorporate multiple item relations is less explored in recommendation research. In this work, we propose Relational Collaborative Filtering (RCF), a general framework to exploit multiple relations between items in recommender system. We find that both the relation type and the relation value are crucial in inferring user preference. To this end, we develop a two-level hierarchical attention mechanism to model user preference. The first-level attention discriminates which types of relations are more important, and the second-level attention considers the specific relation values to estimate the contribution of a historical item in recommending the target item. To make the item embeddings be reflective of the relational structure between items, we further formulate a task to preserve the item relations, and jointly train it with the recommendation task of preference modeling. Empirical results on two real datasets demonstrate the strong performance of RCF. Furthermore, we also conduct qualitative analyses to show the benefits of explanations brought by the modeling of multiple item relations.

**SEALion: a Framework for Neural Network Inference on Encrypted Data**

We present SEALion: an extensible framework for privacy-preserving machine learning with homomorphic encryption. It allows one to learn deep neural networks that can be seamlessly utilized for prediction on encrypted data. The framework consists of two layers: the first is built upon TensorFlow and SEAL and exposes standard algebra and deep learning primitives; the second implements a Keras-like syntax for training and inference with neural networks. Given a required level of security, a user is abstracted from the details of the encoding and the encryption scheme, allowing quick prototyping. We present two applications that exemplifying the extensibility of our proposal, which are also of independent interest: i) improving efficiency of neural network inference by an activity sparsifier and ii) transfer learning by querying a server-side Variational AutoEncoder that can handle encrypted data.

**Adversarial Training for Free!**

Adversarial training, in which a network is trained on adversarial examples, is one of the few defenses against adversarial attacks that withstands strong attacks. Unfortunately, the high cost of generating strong adversarial examples makes standard adversarial training impractical on large-scale problems like ImageNet. We present an algorithm that eliminates the overhead cost of generating adversarial examples by recycling the gradient information computed when updating model parameters. Our ‘free’ adversarial training algorithm achieves state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets at negligible additional cost compared to natural training, and can be 7 to 30 times faster than other strong adversarial training methods. Using a single workstation with 4 P100 GPUs and 2 days of runtime, we can train a robust model for the large-scale ImageNet classification task that maintains 40% accuracy against PGD attacks.

**Online Causal Structure Learning in the Presence of Latent Variables**

We present two online causal structure learning algorithms which can track changes in a causal structure and process data in a dynamic real-time manner. Standard causal structure learning algorithms assume that causal structure does not change during the data collection process, but in real-world scenarios, it does often change. Therefore, it is inappropriate to handle such changes with existing batch-learning approaches, and instead, a structure should be learned in an online manner. The online causal structure learning algorithms we present here can revise correlation values without reprocessing the entire dataset and use an existing model to avoid relearning the causal links in the prior model, which still fit data. Proposed algorithms are tested on synthetic and real-world datasets, the latter being a seasonally adjusted commodity price index dataset for the U.S. The online causal structure learning algorithms outperformed standard FCI by a large margin in learning the changed causal structure correctly and efficiently when latent variables were present.

**On Social Machines for Algorithmic Regulation**

Autonomous mechanisms have been proposed to regulate certain aspects of society and are already being used to regulate business organisations. We take seriously recent proposals for algorithmic regulation of society, and we identify the existing technologies that can be used to implement them, most of them originally introduced in business contexts. We build on the notion of ‘social machine’ and we connect it to various ongoing trends and ideas, including crowdsourced task-work, social compiler, mechanism design, reputation management systems, and social scoring. After showing how all the building blocks of algorithmic regulation are already well in place, we discuss possible implications for human autonomy and social order. The main contribution of this paper is to identify convergent social and technical trends that are leading towards social regulation by algorithms, and to discuss the possible social, political, and ethical consequences of taking this path.
