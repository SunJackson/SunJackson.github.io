A new version 0.4.9 of RQuantLib reached CRAN and Debian. It completes the change of some internals of RQuantLib to follow suit to an upstream change in QuantLib. We can now seamlessly switch between `shared_ptr<>` from Boost and from C++11 – Luigi wrote about the *how* and *why* in an excellent blog post that is part of a larger (and also excellent) series of posts on QuantLib internals.

QuantLib is a very comprehensice *free/open-source* library for quantitative finance, and RQuantLib connects it to the R environment and language.

The complete set of changes is listed below:

Changes in RQuantLib version 0.4.9 (2019-05-15)


Changes in RQuantLib code:

- Completed switch to `QuantLib::ext` namespace wrappers for either `shared_ptr` use started in 0.4.8.





Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for the this release. As always, more detailed information is on the RQuantLib page. Questions, comments etc should go to the new rquantlib-devel mailing list. Issue tickets can be filed at the GitHub repo.
