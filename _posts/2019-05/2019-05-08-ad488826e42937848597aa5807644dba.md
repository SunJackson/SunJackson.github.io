We were thrilled with the overall quality and amount of abstracts we received for this year’s EARL London Conference. Which made our job of selecting the final speakers even more difficult!

We are pleased to share with you the speakers for EARL London 2019 – we will be interviewing some of our speakers over the next few months, so you can find out what to expect from their talks. As you can see we have a wide range of topics and industries covered – so there will be something for everyone.

The final agenda with times will be released in the next few weeks – in the meantime, take a look at who’s talking and make the most of our early bird ticket offers.
