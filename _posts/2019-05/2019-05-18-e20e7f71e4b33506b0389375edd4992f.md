Full-day Workshop: 8:30am – 4:30pm
**Intended Audience:**Practitioners who wish to learn how to execute on predictive analytics by way of the R language; anyone who wants “to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully.”**Knowledge Level:** Either hands-on experience with predictive modeling (without R) or both hands-on familiarity with any programming language (other than R) and basic conceptual knowledge about predictive modeling is sufficient background and preparation to participate in this workshop.The 2 1/2 hour “R Bootcamp” is recommended preparation for this workshop.


Workshop Description


This one-day session provides a hands-on introduction to R, the well-known open-source platform for data analysis. Real examples are employed in order to methodically expose attendees to best practices driving R and its rich set of predictive modeling (machine learning) packages, providing hands-on experience and know-how. R is compared to other data analysis platforms, and common pitfalls in using R are addressed.The instructor will guide attendees on hands-on execution with R, covering:

- A working knowledge of the R system

- The strengths and limitations of the R language

- Preparing data with R, including splitting, resampling and variable creation

- Developing predictive models with R, including the use of these machine learning methods: decision trees, ensemble methods, and others.

- Visualization: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and tools that persuade

- Evaluating predictive models, including viewing lift curves, variable importance and avoiding overfitting


**Hardware: Bring Your Own Laptop**Each workshop participant is required to bring their own laptop running Windows or OS X. The software used during this training program, R, is free and readily available for download.Attendees receive an electronic copy of the course materials and related R code at the conclusion of the workshop.
