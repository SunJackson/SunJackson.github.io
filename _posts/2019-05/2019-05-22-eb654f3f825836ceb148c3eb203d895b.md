**About Murmuration**

Murmuration transforms how political campaigns, advocates, and organizers identify, engage, and mobilize people and communities. Our focus is on driving change and accelerating progress toward a future where every child in America has the opportunity to benefit from a high-quality public education. 

**What We Do**

We provide sophisticated data and analytics, proprietary technology, strategic guidance, and programmatic support to help our partners build political power and marshal support so necessary changes are made to improve our public schools. Our precise, predictive intelligence and easy-to-use tools are used by practitioners and funders, on their own and working together, to make informed decisions about who they need to reach, what they need to say, and how to achieve and sustain impact.

**Who We Are**

Our team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives and political campaign veterans, and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.

**Background**

Over the past four years, Murmuration has established itself as a trusted resource for our partners who include the leading practitioners and funders of efforts to elect people who believe our public schools should be safe, learner-centered, and well-resourced, so they can serve the needs of each individual student, irrespective of background or circumstance. We have demonstrated that our data, analytics, and technology can be used to help deliver improved electoral and organizing outcomes. We have also made early contact with key players across the sector, notably funders and vendors, already working on these and related efforts. Through our work, we have confirmed that to be successful, and to achieve our long-term goals, everyone committed to massively improving public schools and ensuring all children across this country have equal access to quality education must be aligned. Our collective efforts must be focused, disciplined, and the work must be collaborative and wide-ranging. At the same time, we recognize that it will take more than our current offerings – and particularly how and where they are being used, and by whom – to drive sustainable change.

We believe that Murmuration is uniquely positioned to facilitate more coordinated decision-making and collective action among practitioners and funders. We enable and promote collaboration and learning among partners. Our work expands and diversifies the political activities in support of quality public education, and, by sharing our insights so others can learn, we help to advance individual and collective efforts that align with and accelerate progress towards our vision. In short, we believe our perspective on the critical role of politics in transforming public education, the processes to engage in during the journey, and the belief system that underlies the importance of traveling in a particular way, should be broadly understood and embraced by others.
