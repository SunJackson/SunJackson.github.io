**Unsupervised Machine Learning for the Discovery of Latent Disease Clusters and Patient Subgroups Using Electronic Health Records**

Machine learning has become ubiquitous and a key technology on mining electronic health records (EHRs) for facilitating clinical research and practice. Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients’ disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts with EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying latent disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations learned by two approaches. We also tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into more differentiable subgroups than PDM in terms of p-values. However, the subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.

**Computationally Efficient Feature Significance and Importance for Machine Learning Models**

We develop a simple and computationally efficient significance test for the features of a machine learning model. Our forward-selection approach applies to any model specification, learning task and variable type. The test is non-asymptotic, straightforward to implement, and does not require model refitting. It identifies the statistically significant features as well as feature interactions of any order in a hierarchical manner, and generates a model-free notion of feature importance. Numerical results illustrate its performance.

**Distributional Policy Optimization: An Alternative Approach for Continuous Control**

We identify a fundamental problem in policy gradient-based methods in continuous control. As policy gradient methods require the agent’s underlying probability distribution, they limit policy representation to parametric distribution classes. We show that optimizing over such sets results in local movement in the action space and thus convergence to sub-optimal solutions. We suggest a novel distributional framework, able to represent arbitrary distribution functions over the continuous action space. Using this framework, we construct a generative scheme, trained using an off-policy actor-critic paradigm, which we call the Generative Actor Critic (GAC). Compared to policy gradient methods, GAC does not require knowledge of the underlying probability distribution, thereby overcoming these limitations. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach is comparable and often surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines in continuous domains.

**Modeling Smart Contracts Activities: A Tensor Based Approach**

Smart contracts are autonomous software executing predefined conditions. Two of the biggest advantages of the smart contracts are secured protocols and transaction costs reduction. On the Ethereum platform, an open-source blockchain-based platform, smart contracts implement a distributed virtual machine on the distributed ledger. To avoid denial of service attacks and monetize the services, payment transactions are executed whenever code is being executed between contracts. It is thus natural to investigate if predictive analysis is capable to forecast these interactions. We have addressed this issue and propose an innovative application of the tensor decomposition CANDECOMP/PARAFAC to the temporal link prediction of smart contracts. We introduce a new approach leveraging stochastic processes for series predictions based on the tensor decomposition that can be used for smart contracts predictive analytics.

**Non-Negative PARATUCK2 Tensor Decomposition Combined to LSTM Network For Smart Contracts Profiling**

Smart contracts are programs stored and executed on a blockchain. The Ethereum platform, an open-source blockchain-based platform, has been designed to use these programs offering secured protocols and transaction costs reduction. The Ethereum Virtual Machine performs smart contracts runs, where the execution of each contract is limited to the amount of gas required to execute the operations described in the code. Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non-negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases. The main use case is related to analyzing smart contracts and allows shedding some light into the complex interactions among smart contracts. In order to show the generality of our method on other use cases, we also report its performance on video on demand recommendation.

**SelectNet: Learning to Sample from the Wild for Imbalanced Data Training**

Supervised learning from training data with imbalanced class sizes, a commonly encountered scenario in real applications such as anomaly/fraud detection, has long been considered a significant challenge in machine learning. Motivated by recent progress in curriculum and self-paced learning, we propose to adopt a semi-supervised learning paradigm by training a deep neural network, referred to as SelectNet, to selectively add unlabelled data together with their predicted labels to the training dataset. Unlike existing techniques designed to tackle the difficulty in dealing with class imbalanced training data such as resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and margin-based learning, SelectNet provides an end-to-end approach for learning from important unlabelled data ‘in the wild’ that most likely belong to the under-sampled classes in the training data, thus gradually mitigates the imbalance in the data used for training the classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of SelectNet through extensive numerical experiments on standard datasets in computer vision.

**Deep density ratio estimation for change point detection**

In this work, we propose new objective functions to train deep neural network based density ratio estimators and apply it to a change point detection problem. Existing methods use linear combinations of kernels to approximate the density ratio function by solving a convex constrained minimization problem. Approximating the density ratio function using a deep neural network requires defining a suitable objective function to optimize. We formulate and compare objective functions that can be minimized using gradient descent and show that the network can effectively learn to approximate the density ratio function. Using our deep density ratio estimation objective function results in better performance on a seizure detection task than other (kernel and neural network based) density ratio estimation methods and other window-based change point detection algorithms. We also show that the method can still support other neural network architectures, such as convolutional networks.

**Scale Invariant Power Iteration**

Power iteration has been generalized to solve many interesting problems in machine learning and statistics. Despite its striking success, theoretical understanding of when and how such an algorithm enjoys good convergence property is limited. In this work, we introduce a new class of optimization problems called scale invariant problems and prove that they can be efficiently solved by scale invariant power iteration (SCI-PI) with a generalized convergence guarantee of power iteration. By deriving that a stationary point is an eigenvector of the Hessian evaluated at the point, we show that scale invariant problems indeed resemble the leading eigenvector problem near a local optimum. Also, based on a novel reformulation, we geometrically derive SCI-PI which has a general form of power iteration. The convergence analysis shows that SCI-PI attains local linear convergence with a rate being proportional to the top two eigenvalues of the Hessian at the optimum. Moreover, we discuss some extended settings of scale invariant problems and provide similar convergence results for them. In numerical experiments, we introduce applications to independent component analysis, Gaussian mixtures, and non-negative matrix factorization. Experimental results demonstrate that SCI-PI is competitive to state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms and often yield better solutions.

**Training language GANs from Scratch**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) enjoy great success at image generation, but have proven difficult to train in the domain of natural language. Challenges with gradient estimation, optimization instability, and mode collapse have lead practitioners to resort to maximum likelihood pre-training, followed by small amounts of adversarial fine-tuning. The benefits of GAN fine-tuning for language generation are unclear, as the resulting models produce comparable or worse samples than traditional language models. We show it is in fact possible to train a language GAN from scratch — without maximum likelihood pre-training. We combine existing techniques such as large batch sizes, dense rewards and discriminator regularization to stabilize and improve language GANs. The resulting model, ScratchGAN, performs comparably to maximum likelihood training on EMNLP2017 News and WikiText-103 corpora according to quality and diversity metrics.

**Multifaceted Privacy: How to Express Your Online Persona without Revealing Your Sensitive Attributes**

Recent works in social network stream analysis show that a user’s online persona attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, political interest, location, etc.) can be accurately inferred from the topics the user writes about or engages with. Attribute and preference inferences have been widely used to serve personalized recommendations, directed ads, and to enhance the user experience in social networks. However, revealing a user’s sensitive attributes could represent a privacy threat to some individuals. Microtargeting (e.g.,Cambridge Analytica scandal), surveillance, and discriminating ads are examples of threats to user privacy caused by sensitive attribute inference. In this paper, we propose Multifaceted privacy, a novel privacy model that aims to obfuscate a user’s sensitive attributes while publicly preserving the user’s public persona. To achieve multifaceted privacy, we build Aegis, a prototype client-centric social network stream processing system that helps preserve multifaceted privacy, and thus allowing social network users to freely express their online personas without revealing their sensitive attributes of choice. Aegis allows social network users to control which persona attributes should be publicly revealed and which ones should be kept private. For this, Aegis continuously suggests topics and hashtags to social network users to post in order to obfuscate their sensitive attributes and hence confuse content-based sensitive attribute inferences. The suggested topics are carefully chosen to preserve the user’s publicly revealed persona attributes while hiding their private sensitive persona attributes. Our experiments show that adding as few as 0 to 4 obfuscation posts (depending on how revealing the original post is) successfully hides the user specified sensitive attributes without changing the user’s public persona attributes.

**Embedded Meta-Learning: Toward more flexible deep-learning models**

How can deep learning systems flexibly reuse their knowledge? Toward this goal, we propose a new class of challenges, and a class of architectures that can solve them. The challenges are meta-mappings, which involve systematically transforming task behaviors to adapt to new tasks zero-shot. We suggest that the key to achieving these challenges is representing the task being performed along with the computations used to perform it. We therefore draw inspiration from meta-learning and functional programming to propose a class of Embedded Meta-Learning (EML) architectures that represent both data and tasks in a shared latent space. EML architectures are applicable to any type of machine learning task, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the flexibility of these architectures by showing that they can perform meta-mappings, i.e. that they can exhibit zero-shot remapping of behavior to adapt to new tasks.

**Robust Attribution Regularization**

An emerging problem in trustworthy machine learning is to train models that produce robust interpretations for their predictions. We take a step towards solving this problem through the lens of axiomatic attribution of neural networks. Our theory is grounded in the recent work, Integrated Gradients (IG), in axiomatically attributing a neural network’s output change to its input change. We propose training objectives in classic robust optimization models to achieve robust IG attributions. Our objectives give principled generalizations of previous objectives designed for robust predictions, and they naturally degenerate to classic soft-margin training for one-layer neural networks. We also generalize previous theory and prove that the objectives for different robust optimization models are closely related. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and also point to intriguing problems which hint at the need for better optimization techniques or better neural network architectures for robust attribution training.

**Robust Variational Autoencoder**

Machine learning methods often need a large amount of labeled training data. Since the training data is assumed to be the ground truth, outliers can severely degrade learned representations and performance of trained models. Here we apply concepts from robust statistics to derive a novel variational autoencoder that is robust to outliers in the training data. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) extract a lower dimensional encoded feature representation from which we can generate new data samples. Robustness of autoencoders to outliers is critical for generating a reliable representation of particular data types in the encoded space when using corrupted training data. Our robust VAE is based on beta-divergence rather than the standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our proposed model has the same computational complexity as the VAE, and contains a single tuning parameter to control the degree of robustness. We demonstrate performance of the beta-divergence based autoencoder for a range of image data types, showing improved robustness to outliers both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also illustrate the use of the robust VAE for outlier detection.

**The Skipping Sampler: A new approach to sample from complex conditional densities**

We introduce the Skipping Sampler, a novel algorithm to efficiently sample from the restriction of an arbitrary probability density to an arbitrary measurable set. Such conditional densities can arise in the study of risk and reliability and are often of complex nature, for example having multiple isolated modes and non-convex or disconnected support. The sampler can be seen as an instance of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a particular proposal structure, and we establish sufficient conditions under which the Strong Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem hold. We give theoretical and numerical evidence of improved performance relative to the Random Walk Metropolis algorithm.

**Generative Adversarial Networks for Mitigating Biases in Machine Learning Systems**

In this paper, we propose a new framework for mitigating biases in machine learning systems. The problem of the existing mitigation approaches is that they are model-oriented in the sense that they focus on tuning the training algorithms to produce fair results, while overlooking the fact that the training data can itself be the main reason for biased outcomes. Technically speaking, two essential limitations can be found in such model-based approaches: 1) the mitigation cannot be achieved without degrading the accuracy of the machine learning models, and 2) when the data used for training are largely biased, the training time automatically increases so as to find suitable learning parameters that help produce fair results. To address these shortcomings, we propose in this work a new framework that can largely mitigate the biases and discriminations in machine learning systems while at the same time enhancing the prediction accuracy of these systems. The proposed framework is based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), which are used to generate new synthetic fair data with selective properties from the original data. We also propose a framework for analyzing data biases, which is important for understanding the amount and type of data that need to be synthetically sampled and labeled for each population group. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can efficiently mitigate different types of biases, while at the same time enhancing the prediction accuracy of the underlying machine learning model.

**EnsembleNet: End-to-End Optimization of Multi-headed Models**

Ensembling is a universally useful approach to boost the performance of machine learning models. However, individual models in an ensemble are typically trained independently in separate stages, without information access about the overall ensemble. In this paper, model ensembles are treated as first-class citizens, and their performance is optimized end-to-end with parameter sharing and a novel loss structure that improves generalization. On large-scale datasets including ImageNet, Youtube-8M, and Kinetics, we demonstrate a procedure that starts from a strongly performing single deep neural network, and constructs an EnsembleNet that has both a smaller size and better performance. Moreover, an EnsembleNet can be trained in one stage just like a single model without manual intervention.

**Learning Mahalanobis Metric Spaces via Geometric Approximation Algorithms**

Learning Mahalanobis metric spaces is an important problem that has found numerous applications. Several algorithms have been designed for this problem, including Information Theoretic Metric Learning (ITML) by [Davis et al. 2007] and Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) classification by [Weinberger and Saul 2009]. We consider a formulation of Mahalanobis metric learning as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the number of violated similarity/dissimilarity constraints. We show that for any fixed ambient dimension, there exists a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with nearlylinear running time. This result is obtained using tools from the theory of linear programming in low dimensions. We also discuss improvements of the algorithm in practice, and present experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets.

**Painless Stochastic Gradient: Interpolation, Line-Search, and Convergence Rates**

Recent works have shown that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves the fast convergence rates of full-batch gradient descent for over-parameterized models satisfying certain interpolation conditions. However, the step-size used in these works depends on unknown quantities, and SGD’s practical performance heavily relies on the choice of the step-size. We propose to use line-search methods to automatically set the step-size when training models that can interpolate the data. We prove that SGD with the classic Armijo line-search attains the fast convergence rates of full-batch gradient descent in convex and strongly-convex settings. We also show that under additional assumptions, SGD with a modified line-search can attain a fast rate of convergence for non-convex functions. Furthermore, we show that a stochastic extra-gradient method with a Lipschitz line-search attains a fast convergence rate for an important class of non-convex functions and saddle-point problems satisfying interpolation. We then give heuristics to use larger step-sizes and acceleration with our line-search techniques. We compare the proposed algorithms against numerous optimization methods for standard classification tasks using both kernel methods and deep networks. The proposed methods are robust and result in competitive performance across all models and datasets. Moreover, for the deep network models, SGD with our line-search results in both faster convergence and better generalization.

**Self-Critical Reasoning for Robust Visual Question Answering**

Visual Question Answering (VQA) deep-learning systems tend to capture superficial statistical correlations in the training data because of strong language priors and fail to generalize to test data with a significantly different question-answer (QA) distribution. To address this issue, we introduce a self-critical training objective that ensures that visual explanations of correct answers match the most influential image regions more than other competitive answer candidates. The influential regions are either determined from human visual/textual explanations or automatically from just significant words in the question and answer. We evaluate our approach on the VQA generalization task using the VQA-CP dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art i.e. 49.5\% using textual explanations and 48.5\% using automatically annotated regions.

**Not All Features Are Equal: Feature Leveling Deep Neural Networks for Better Interpretation**

Self-explaining models are models that reveal decision making parameters in an interpretable manner so that the model reasoning process can be directly understood by human beings. General Linear Models (GLMs) are self-explaining because the model weights directly show how each feature contribute to the output value. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are in general not self-explaining due to the non-linearity of the activation functions, complex architectures, obscure feature extraction and transformation process. In this work, we illustrate the fact that existing deep architectures are hard to interpret because each hidden layer carries a mix of high level features and low level features. As a solution, we propose a novel feature leveling architecture that isolates low level features from high level features on a per-layer basis to better utilize the GLM layer in the proposed architecture for interpretation. Experimental results show that our modified models are able to achieve competitive results comparing to main-stream architectures on standard datasets while being more self-explaining. Our implementations and configurations are publicly available for reproductions.

**Deep-gKnock: nonlinear group-feature selection with deep neural network**

Feature selection is central to contemporary high-dimensional data analysis. Grouping structure among features arises naturally in various scientific problems. Many methods have been proposed to incorporate the grouping structure information into feature selection. However, these methods are normally restricted to a linear regression setting. To relax the linear constraint, we combine the deep neural networks (DNNs) with the recent Knockoffs technique, which has been successful in an individual feature selection context. We propose Deep-gKnock (Deep group-feature selection using Knockoffs) as a methodology for model interpretation and dimension reduction. Deep-gKnock performs model-free group-feature selection by controlling group-wise False Discovery Rate (gFDR). Our method improves the interpretability and reproducibility of DNNs. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior power and accurate gFDR control compared with state-of-the-art methods.

**Rethinking Expected Cumulative Reward Formalism of Reinforcement Learning: A Micro-Objective Perspective**

The standard reinforcement learning (RL) formulation considers the expectation of the (discounted) cumulative reward. This is limiting in applications where we are concerned with not only the expected performance, but also the distribution of the performance. In this paper, we introduce micro-objective reinforcement learning — an alternative RL formalism that overcomes this issue. In this new formulation, a RL task is specified by a set of micro-objectives, which are constructs that specify the desirability or undesirability of events. In addition, micro-objectives allow prior knowledge in the form of temporal abstraction to be incorporated into the global RL objective. The generality of this formalism, and its relations to single/multi-objective RL, and hierarchical RL are discussed.

**Power up! Robust Graph Convolutional Network against Evasion Attacks based on Graph Powering**

Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful tools for graph-structured data. However, they have been recently shown to be prone to topological attacks. Despite substantial efforts to search for new architectures, it still remains a challenge to improve performance in both benign and adversarial situations simultaneously. In this paper, we re-examine the fundamental building block of GCN—the Laplacian operator—and highlight some basic flaws in the spatial and spectral domains. As an alternative, we propose an operator based on graph powering, and prove that it enjoys a desirable property of ‘spectral separation.’ Based on the operator, we propose a robust learning paradigm, where the network is trained on a family of ”smoothed’ graphs that span a spatial and spectral range for generalizability. We also use the new operator in replacement of the classical Laplacian to construct an architecture with improved spectral robustness, expressivity and interpretability. The enhanced performance and robustness are demonstrated in extensive experiments.

**Personalizing Dialogue Agents via Meta-Learning**

Existing personalized dialogue models use human designed persona descriptions to improve dialogue consistency. Collecting such descriptions from existing dialogues is expensive and requires hand-crafted feature designs. In this paper, we propose to extend Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)(Finn et al., 2017) to personalized dialogue learning without using any persona descriptions. Our model learns to quickly adapt to new personas by leveraging only a few dialogue samples collected from the same user, which is fundamentally different from conditioning the response on the persona descriptions. Empirical results on Persona-chat dataset (Zhang et al., 2018) indicate that our solution outperforms non-meta-learning baselines using automatic evaluation metrics, and in terms of human-evaluated fluency and consistency.

**Parallel Coordinate Order for High-Dimensional Data**

Visualization of high-dimensional data is counter-intuitive using conventional graphs. Parallel coordinates are proposed as an alternative to explore multivariate data more effectively. However, it is difficult to extract relevant information through the parallel coordinates when the data are high-dimensional with thousands of lines overlapping. The order of the axes determines the perception of information on parallel coordinates. Thus, the information between attributes remain hidden if coordinates are improperly ordered. Here we propose a general framework to reorder the coordinates. This framework is general to cover a large range of data visualization objective. It is also flexible to contain many conventional ordering measures. Consequently, we present the coordinate ordering binary optimization problem and enhance towards a computationally efficient greedy approach that suites high-dimensional data. Our approach is applied on wine data and on genetic data. The purpose of dimension reordering of wine data is highlighting attributes dependence. Genetic data are reordered to enhance cluster detection. The presented framework shows that it is able to adapt the measures and criteria tested.

**Brain-mediated Transfer Learning of Convolutional Neural Networks**

Human flexible cognition and behavior indicate that the human brain can effectively use its internal feature representations acquired through limited experiences for new experiences in different domains. This function is analogous to transfer learning (TL) in the field of machine learning. TL uses a well-trained feature space in a specific task domain to improve performance in new tasks with insufficient training data. TL with rich feature representations, such as features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), shows high generalization ability across different task domains. However, such TL is still insufficient in making machine learning attain generalization ability comparable to that of the human brain. To address this, we introduce a method for TL mediated by human brains to improve the performance of TL especially on pattern recognition in which human high-level cognition is considered. Our method transforms feature representations of audiovisual inputs in CNNs into those in activation patterns of individual brains via their association learned ahead using measured brain responses. Then, to estimate labels reflecting human cognition and behavior induced by the audiovisual inputs, the transformed representations are used for TL. We demonstrate that our brain-mediated TL (BTL) shows higher performance in the label estimation than the standard TL. In addition, we illustrate that the estimations mediated by different brains vary from brain to brain, and the variability reflects the individual variability in perception. Thus, our BTL provides a framework to improve the generalization ability of machine-learning feature representations and enable machine learning to estimate human-like cognition and behavior, including individual variability.

**Outline Generation: Understanding the Inherent Content Structure of Documents**

In this paper, we introduce and tackle the Outline Generation (OG) task, which aims to unveil the inherent content structure of a multi-paragraph document by identifying its potential sections and generating the corresponding section headings. Without loss of generality, the OG task can be viewed as a novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task. Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways. First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and eliminate duplication between section headings. Besides, we build a novel WIKIOG dataset, a public collection which consists of over 1.75 million document-outline pairs for research on the OG task. Experimental results on our benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art sequential generation models for the OG task.

**Efficient Batch Black-box Optimization with Deterministic Regret Bounds**

In this work, we investigate black-box optimization from the perspective of frequentist kernel methods. We propose a novel batch optimization algorithm to jointly maximize the acquisition function and select points from a whole batch in a holistic way. Theoretically, we derive regret bounds for both the noise-free and perturbation settings. Moreover, we analyze the property of the adversarial regret that is required by robust initialization for Bayesian Optimization (BO), and prove that the adversarial regret bounds decrease with the decrease of covering radius, which provides a criterion for generating (initialization point set) to minimize the bound. We then propose fast searching algorithms to generate a point set with a small covering radius for the robust initialization. Experimental results on both synthetic benchmark problems and real-world problems show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

**Curriculum Loss: Robust Learning and Generalization against Label Corruption**

Generalization is vital important for many deep network models. It becomes more challenging when high robustness is required for learning with noisy labels. The 0-1 loss has monotonic relationship between empirical adversary (reweighted) risk, and it is robust to outliers. However, it is also difficult to optimize. To efficiently optimize 0-1 loss while keeping its robust properties, we propose a very simple and efficient loss, i.e. curriculum loss (CL). Our CL is a tighter upper bound of the 0-1 loss compared with conventional summation based surrogate losses. Moreover, CL can adaptively select samples for training as a curriculum learning. To handle large rate of noisy label corruption, we extend our curriculum loss to a more general form that can automatically prune the estimated noisy samples during training. Experimental results on noisy MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset validate the robustness of the proposed loss.

**Federated Forest**

Most real-world data are scattered across different companies or government organizations, and cannot be easily integrated under data privacy and related regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and China’ Cyber Security Law. Such data islands situation and data privacy & security are two major challenges for applications of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we tackle these challenges and propose a privacy-preserving machine learning model, called Federated Forest, which is a lossless learning model of the traditional random forest method, i.e., achieving the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach. Based on it, we developed a secure cross-regional machine learning system that allows a learning process to be jointly trained over different regions’ clients with the same user samples but different attribute sets, processing the data stored in each of them without exchanging their raw data. A novel prediction algorithm was also proposed which could largely reduce the communication overhead. Experiments on both real-world and UCI data sets demonstrate the performance of the Federated Forest is as accurate as the non-federated version. The efficiency and robustness of our proposed system had been verified. Overall, our model is practical, scalable and extensible for real-life tasks.

**Label-aware Document Representation via Hybrid Attention for Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification**

Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) aims at tagging a document with most relevant labels from an extremely large-scale label set. It is a challenging problem especially for the tail labels because there are only few training documents to build classifier. This paper is motivated to better explore the semantic relationship between each document and extreme labels by taking advantage of both document content and label correlation. Our objective is to establish an explicit label-aware representation for each document with a hybrid attention deep neural network model (LAHA). LAHA consists of three parts. The first part adopts a multi-label self-attention mechanism to detect the contribution of each word to labels. The second part exploits the label structure and document content to determine the semantic connection between words and labels in a same latent space. An adaptive fusion strategy is designed in the third part to obtain the final label-aware document representation so that the essence of previous two parts can be sufficiently integrated. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmark datasets by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show the superiority of our proposed LAHA method, especially on the tail labels.

**Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards**

Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years. Recent methods such as curiosity-driven exploration usually estimate the novelty of new observations by the prediction errors of their system dynamics models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to the RL domain and utilize the errors from optical flow estimation to evaluate the novelty of new observations. We introduce a flow-based intrinsic curiosity module (FICM) capable of learning the motion features and understanding the observations in a more comprehensive and efficient fashion. We evaluate our method and compare it with a number of baselines on several benchmark environments, including Atari games, Super Mario Bros., and ViZDoom. Our results show that the proposed method is superior to the baselines in certain environments, especially for those featuring sophisticated moving patterns or with high-dimensional observation spaces. We further analyze the hyper-parameters used in the training phase and discuss our insights into them.

**Training decision trees as replacement for convolution layers**

We present an alternative layer to convolution layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach reduces the complexity of convolutions by replacing it with binary decisions. Those binary decisions are used as indexes to conditional probability distributions where each probability represents a leaf in a decision tree. This means that only the indices to the probabilities need to be determined once, thus reducing the complexity of convolutions by the depth of the output tensor. Index computation is performed by simple binary decisions that require fewer CPU cycles compared to conventionally used multiplications. In addition, we show how convolutions can be replaced by binary decisions. These binary decisions form indices in the conditional probability distributions and we show how they are used to replace 2D weight matrices as well as 3D weight tensors. These new layers can be trained like convolution layers in CNNs based on the backpropagation algorithm, for which we provide a formalization. Our results on multiple publicly available data sets show that our approach outperforms conventional CNNs. Beyond the formalized reduction of complexity and the improved qualitative performance, we show empirically a significant runtime improvement compared to convolution layers.

**Neuro-Optimization: Learning Objective Functions Using Neural Networks**

Mathematical optimization is widely used in various research fields. With a carefully-designed objective function, mathematical optimization can be quite helpful in solving many problems. However, objective functions are usually hand-crafted and designing a good one can be quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn the objective function based on a neural net-work. The basic idea is to consider the neural network as an objective function, and the input as an optimization variable. For the learning of objective function from the training data, two processes are conducted: In the inner process, the optimization variable (the input of the network) are optimized to minimize the objective function (the network output), while fixing the network weights. In the outer process, on the other hand, the weights are optimized based on how close the final solution of the inner process is to the desired solution. After learning the objective function, the solution for the test set is obtained in the same manner of the inner process. The potential and applicability of our approach are demonstrated by the experiments on toy examples and a computer vision task, optical flow.

**Conditional t-SNE: Complementary t-SNE embeddings through factoring out prior information**

Dimensionality reduction and manifold learning methods such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are routinely used to map high-dimensional data into a 2-dimensional space to visualize and explore the data. However, two dimensions are typically insufficient to capture all structure in the data, the salient structure is often already known, and it is not obvious how to extract the remaining information in a similarly effective manner. To fill this gap, we introduce \emph{conditional t-SNE} (ct-SNE), a generalization of t-SNE that discounts prior information from the embedding in the form of labels. To achieve this, we propose a conditioned version of the t-SNE objective, obtaining a single, integrated, and elegant method. ct-SNE has one extra parameter over t-SNE; we investigate its effects and show how to efficiently optimize the objective. Factoring out prior knowledge allows complementary structure to be captured in the embedding, providing new insights. Qualitative and quantitative empirical results on synthetic and (large) real data show ct-SNE is effective and achieves its goal.

**Deploying AI Frameworks on Secure HPC Systems with Containers**

The increasing interest in the usage of Artificial Intelligence techniques (AI) from the research community and industry to tackle ‘real world’ problems, requires High Performance Computing (HPC) resources to efficiently compute and scale complex algorithms across thousands of nodes. Unfortunately, typical data scientists are not familiar with the unique requirements and characteristics of HPC environments. They usually develop their applications with high-level scripting languages or frameworks such as TensorFlow and the installation process often requires connection to external systems to download open source software during the build. HPC environments, on the other hand, are often based on closed source applications that incorporate parallel and distributed computing API’s such as MPI and OpenMP, while users have restricted administrator privileges, and face security restrictions such as not allowing access to external systems. In this paper we discuss the issues associated with the deployment of AI frameworks in a secure HPC environment and how we successfully deploy AI frameworks on SuperMUC-NG with Charliecloud.

**Deep Model Predictive Control with Online Learning for Complex Physical Systems**

The control of complex systems is of critical importance in many branches of science, engineering, and industry. Controlling an unsteady fluid flow is particularly important, as flow control is a key enabler for technologies in energy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g., planes, trains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and health (e.g., artificial hearts and artificial respiration). However, the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multi-scale dynamics make real-time feedback control infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional systems exhibit dominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for effective control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system is not required. Advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize flow control given its ability to extract principled, low-rank feature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep learning model predictive control (DeepMPC) framework that exploits low-rank features of the flow in order to achieve considerable improvements to control performance. Instead of predicting the entire fluid state, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant quantities of the system. The RNN is then embedded into a MPC framework to construct a feedback loop, and incoming sensor data is used to perform online updates to improve prediction accuracy. The results are validated using varying fluid flow examples of increasing complexity.

**Learning Cross-Domain Representation with Multi-Graph Neural Network**

Learning effective embedding has been proved to be useful in many real-world problems, such as recommender systems, search ranking and online advertisement. However, one of the challenges is data sparsity in learning large-scale item embedding, as users’ historical behavior data are usually lacking or insufficient in an individual domain. In fact, user’s behaviors from different domains regarding the same items are usually relevant. Therefore, we can learn complete user behaviors to alleviate the sparsity using complementary information from correlated domains. It is intuitive to model users’ behaviors using graph, and graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown the great power for representation learning, which can be used to learn item embedding. However, it is challenging to transfer the information across domains and learn cross-domain representation using the existing GNNs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel model – Deep Multi-Graph Embedding (DMGE) to learn cross-domain representation. Specifically, we first construct a multi-graph based on users’ behaviors from different domains, and then propose a multi-graph neural network to learn cross-domain representation in an unsupervised manner. Particularly, we present a multiple-gradient descent optimizer for efficiently training the model. We evaluate our approach on various large-scale real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that DMGE outperforms other state-of-art embedding methods in various tasks.

**HDI-Forest: Highest Density Interval Regression Forest**

By seeking the narrowest prediction intervals (PIs) that satisfy the specified coverage probability requirements, the recently proposed quality-based PI learning principle can extract high-quality PIs that better summarize the predictive certainty in regression tasks, and has been widely applied to solve many practical problems. Currently, the state-of-the-art quality-based PI estimation methods are based on deep neural networks or linear models. In this paper, we propose Highest Density Interval Regression Forest (HDI-Forest), a novel quality-based PI estimation method that is instead based on Random Forest. HDI-Forest does not require additional model training, and directly reuses the trees learned in a standard Random Forest model. By utilizing the special properties of Random Forest, HDI-Forest could efficiently and more directly optimize the PI quality metrics. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that HDI-Forest significantly outperforms previous approaches, reducing the average PI width by over 30\% while achieving the same or better coverage probability.

**Learning Surrogate Losses**

The minimization of loss functions is the heart and soul of Machine Learning. In this paper, we propose an off-the-shelf optimization approach that can minimize virtually any non-differentiable and non-decomposable loss function (e.g. Miss-classification Rate, AUC, F1, Jaccard Index, Mathew Correlation Coefficient, etc.) seamlessly. Our strategy learns smooth relaxation versions of the true losses by approximating them through a surrogate neural network. The proposed loss networks are set-wise models which are invariant to the order of mini-batch instances. Ultimately, the surrogate losses are learned jointly with the prediction model via bilevel optimization. Empirical results on multiple datasets with diverse real-life loss functions compared with state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the efficiency of learning surrogate losses.

**Multi-Kernel Correntropy for Robust Learning**

As a novel similarity measure that is defined as the expectation of a kernel function between two random variables, correntropy has been successfully applied in robust machine learning and signal processing to combat large outliers. The kernel function in correntropy is usually a zero-mean Gaussian kernel. In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed to improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture Gaussian kernel, namely a linear combination of several zero-mean Gaussian kernels with different widths. In both correntropy and mixture correntropy, the center of the kernel function is, however, always located at zero. In the present work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the concept of multi-kernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the mixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties of the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine the free parameters in MKC. Experimental results show that the learning algorithms under the maximum multi-kernel correntropy criterion (MMKCC) can outperform those under the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the maximum mixture correntropy criterion (MMCC).

**X-TrainCaps: Accelerated Training of Capsule Nets through Lightweight Software Optimizations**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extensively in use due to their excellent results in various machine learning (ML) tasks like image classification and object detection. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have shown improved performances compared to the traditional CNNs, by encoding and preserving spatial relationships between the detected features in a better way. This is achieved through the so-called Capsules (i.e., groups of neurons) that encode both the instantiation probability and the spatial information. However, one of the major hurdles in the wide adoption of CapsNets is its gigantic training time, which is primarily due to the relatively higher complexity of its constituting elements. In this paper, we illustrate how can we devise new optimizations in the training process to achieve fast training of CapsNets, and if such optimizations affect the network accuracy or not. Towards this, we propose a novel framework ‘X-TrainCaps’ that employs lightweight software-level optimizations, including a novel learning rate policy called WarmAdaBatch that jointly performs warm restarts and adaptive batch size, as well as weight sharing for capsule layers to reduce the hardware requirements of CapsNets by removing unused/redundant connections and capsules, while keeping high accuracy through tests of different learning rate policies and batch sizes. We demonstrate that one of the solutions generated by X-TrainCaps framework can achieve 58.6% training time reduction while preserving the accuracy (even 0.9% accuracy improvement), compared to the CapsNet in the original paper by Sabour et al. (2017), while other Pareto-optimal solutions can be leveraged to realize trade-offs between training time and achieved accuracy.

**Adaptive Symmetric Reward Noising for Reinforcement Learning**

Recent reinforcement learning algorithms, though achieving impressive results in various fields, suffer from brittle training effects such as regression in results and high sensitivity to initialization and parameters. We claim that some of the brittleness stems from variance differences, i.e. when different environment areas – states and/or actions – have different rewards variance. This causes two problems: First, the ‘Boring Areas Trap’ in algorithms such as Q-learning, where moving between areas depends on the current area variance, and getting out of a boring area is hard due to its low variance. Second, the ‘Manipulative Consultant’ problem, when value-estimation functions used in DQN and Actor-Critic algorithms influence the agent to prefer boring areas, regardless of the mean rewards return, as they maximize estimation precision rather than rewards. This sheds a new light on how exploration contribute to training, as it helps with both challenges. Cognitive experiments in humans showed that noised reward signals may paradoxically improve performance. We explain this using the two mentioned problems, claiming that both humans and algorithms may share similar challenges. Inspired by this result, we propose the Adaptive Symmetric Reward Noising (ASRN), by which we mean adding Gaussian noise to rewards according to their states’ estimated variance, thus avoiding the two problems while not affecting the environment’s mean rewards behavior. We conduct our experiments in a Multi Armed Bandit problem with variance differences. We demonstrate that a Q-learning algorithm shows the brittleness effect in this problem, and that the ASRN scheme can dramatically improve the results. We show that ASRN helps a DQN algorithm training process reach better results in an end to end autonomous driving task using the AirSim driving simulator.

**Generative adversarial network based on chaotic time series**

Generative adversarial network (GAN) is gaining increased importance in artificially constructing natural images and related functionalities wherein two networks called generator and discriminator are evolving through adversarial mechanisms. Using deep convolutional neural networks and related techniques, high-resolution, highly realistic scenes, human faces, among others have been generated. While GAN in general needs a large amount of genuine training data sets, it is noteworthy that vast amounts of pseudorandom numbers are required. Here we utilize chaotic time series generated experimentally by semiconductor lasers for the latent variables of GAN whereby the inherent nature of chaos can be reflected or transformed into the generated output data. We show that the similarity in proximity, which is a degree of robustness of the generated images with respects to a minute change in the input latent variables, is enhanced while the versatility as a whole is not severely degraded. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the surrogate chaos time series eliminates the signature of generated images that is originally observed corresponding to the negative autocorrelation inherent in the chaos sequence. We also discuss the impact of utilizing chaotic time series in retrieving images from the trained generator.
