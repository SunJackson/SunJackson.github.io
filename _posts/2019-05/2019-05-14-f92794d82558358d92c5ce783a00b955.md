The *Game of Thrones* character, Daenerys Targaryen, suffered a hit to her reputation in the final season of the much-watched HBO series. For the past few years, she has been a crowd favorite–combining brave determination, style, and dragon(s). Many people went a step further in their admiration and named their offspring after her. Below are a couple of charts showing just how many, plus a demographic breakdown.
