**Deep Planning Network (PlaNet)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Planning has been very successful for control tasks with known environment dynamics. To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from pixels and chooses actions through online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this problem using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition function and a generalized variational inference objective that we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards. PlaNet uses significantly fewer episodes and reaches final performance close to and sometimes higher than top model-free algorithms. … 

**Hybrid Density- and Partition-Based Clustering (HyDaP)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Clustering is an essential technique for discovering patterns in data. The steady increase in amount and complexity of data over the years led to improvements and development of new clustering algorithms. However, algorithms that can cluster data with mixed variable types (continuous and categorical) remain limited, despite the abundance of data with mixed types particularly in the medical field. Among existing methods for mixed data, some posit unverifiable distributional assumptions or that the contributions of different variable types are not well balanced. We propose a two-step hybrid density- and partition-based algorithm (HyDaP) that can detect clusters after variables selection. The first step involves both density-based and partition-based algorithms to identify the data structure formed by continuous variables and recognize the important variables for clustering; the second step involves partition-based algorithm together with a novel dissimilarity measure we designed for mixed data to obtain clustering results. Simulations across various scenarios and data structures were conducted to examine the performance of the HyDaP algorithm compared to commonly used methods. We also applied the HyDaP algorithm on electronic health records to identify sepsis phenotypes. … 

**Statues Algorithm** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present here a new probabilistic inference algorithm that gives exact results in the domain of discrete probability distributions. This algorithm, named the Statues algorithm, calculates the marginal probability distribution on probabilistic models defined as direct acyclic graphs. These models are made up of well-defined primitives that allow to express, in particular, joint probability distributions, Bayesian networks, discrete Markov chains, conditioning and probabilistic arithmetic. The Statues algorithm relies on a variable binding mechanism based on the generator construct, a special form of coroutine; being related to the enumeration algorithm, this new algorithm brings important improvements in terms of efficiency, which makes it valuable in regard to other exact marginalization algorithms. After introduction of several definitions, primitives and compositional rules, we present in details the Statues algorithm. Then, we briefly discuss the interest of this algorithm compared to others and we present possible extensions. Finally, we introduce Lea and MicroLea, two Python libraries implementing the Statues algorithm, along with several use cases. …
