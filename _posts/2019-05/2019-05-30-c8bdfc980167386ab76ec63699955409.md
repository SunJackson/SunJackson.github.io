If you could talk to a predictive machine learning model, what would you ask for?

Try! MichaÅ‚ KuÅºba is developing a mind-blowing project â€“ xai chat-bot. Dialog based system that helps to explore and understand predictive models through natural language conversations (type, speak or phone the model ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 ).

For example, imagine that you have a random forest model that predicts survival for titanic data. With xai-bot you can chat about your chances of survival, variables that influence survival, options that you have to increase your odds or just chat about ~~life~~ models.

The chatbot is based on dialog-flow google infrastructure. It communicates with DALEX explainers written in R through plumber REST API.

The project is under development, but the bot is already pretty smart.

So, have fun!
