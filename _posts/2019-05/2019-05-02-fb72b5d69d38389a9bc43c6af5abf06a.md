Interpretable machine learning tackles the important problem that humans cannot understand the behaviors of complex machine learning models and how these classifiers arrive at a particular decision. Although many approaches have been proposed, a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and challenges is still lacking. This paper provides a survey covering existing techniques and methods to increase the interpretability of machine learning models and also discusses the crucial issues to consider in future work such as interpretation design principles and evaluation metrics in order to push forward the area of interpretable machine learning.
