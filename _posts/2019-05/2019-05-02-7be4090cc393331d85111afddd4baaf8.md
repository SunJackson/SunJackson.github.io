**Everyone is a Cartoonist: Selfie Cartoonization with Attentive Adversarial Networks**

Selfie and cartoon are two popular artistic forms that are widely presented in our daily life. Despite the great progress in image translation/stylization, few techniques focus specifically on selfie cartoonization, since cartoon images usually contain artistic abstraction (e.g., large smoothing areas) and exaggeration (e.g., large/delicate eyebrows). In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a selfie cartoonization Generative Adversarial Network (scGAN), which mainly uses an attentive adversarial network (AAN) to emphasize specific facial regions and ignore low-level details. More specifically, we first design a cycle-like architecture to enable training with unpaired data. Then we design three losses from different aspects. A total variation loss is used to highlight important edges and contents in cartoon portraits. An attentive cycle loss is added to lay more emphasis on delicate facial areas such as eyes. In addition, a perceptual loss is included to eliminate artifacts and improve robustness of our method. Experimental results show that our method is capable of generating different cartoon styles and outperforms a number of state-of-the-art methods.

**Learning from Sets of Items in Recommender Systems**

Most of the existing recommender systems use the ratings provided by users on individual items. An additional source of preference information is to use the ratings that users provide on sets of items. The advantages of using preferences on sets are two-fold. First, a rating provided on a set conveys some preference information about each of the set’s items, which allows us to acquire a user’s preferences for more items that the number of ratings that the user provided. Second, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing to reveal their preferences on individual items explicitly but may be willing to provide a single rating to a set of items, since it provides some level of information hiding. This paper investigates two questions related to using set-level ratings in recommender systems. First, how users’ item-level ratings relate to their set-level ratings. Second, how collaborative filtering-based models for item-level rating prediction can take advantage of such set-level ratings. We have collected set-level ratings from active users of Movielens on sets of movies that they have rated in the past. Our analysis of these ratings shows that though the majority of the users provide the average of the ratings on a set’s constituent items as the rating on the set, there exists a significant number of users that tend to consistently either under- or over-rate the sets. We have developed collaborative filtering-based methods to explicitly model these user behaviors that can be used to recommend items to users. Experiments on real data and on synthetic data that resembles the under- or over-rating behavior in the real data, demonstrate that these models can recover the overall characteristics of the underlying data and predict the user’s ratings on individual items.

**ExplaiNE: An Approach for Explaining Network Embedding-based Link Predictions**

Networks are powerful data structures, but are challenging to work with for conventional machine learning methods. Network Embedding (NE) methods attempt to resolve this by learning vector representations for the nodes, for subsequent use in downstream machine learning tasks. Link Prediction (LP) is one such downstream machine learning task that is an important use case and popular benchmark for NE methods. Unfortunately, while NE methods perform exceedingly well at this task, they are lacking in transparency as compared to simpler LP approaches. We introduce ExplaiNE, an approach to offer counterfactual explanations for NE-based LP methods, by identifying existing links in the network that explain the predicted links. ExplaiNE is applicable to a broad class of NE algorithms. An extensive empirical evaluation for the NE method `Conditional Network Embedding’ in particular demonstrates its accuracy and scalability.

**Exploring the Daschle Collection using Text Mining**

A U.S. Senator from South Dakota donated documents that were accumulated during his service as a house representative and senator to be housed at the Bridges library at South Dakota State University. This project investigated the utility of quantitative statistical methods to explore some portions of this vast document collection. The available scanned documents and emails from constituents are analyzed using natural language processing methods including the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. This model identified major topics being discussed in a given collection of documents. Important events and popular issues from the Senator Daschles career are reflected in the changing topics from the model. These quantitative statistical methods provide a summary of the massive amount of text without requiring significant human effort or time and can be applied to similar collections.

**Beauty Learning and Counterfactual Inference**

This work showcases a new approach for causal discovery by leveraging user experiments and recent advances in photo-realistic image editing, demonstrating a potential of identifying causal factors and understanding complex systems counterfactually. We introduce the beauty learning problem as an example, which has been discussed metaphysically for centuries and been proved exists, is quantifiable, and can be learned by deep models in our recent paper, where we utilize a natural image generator coupled with user studies to infer causal effects from facial semantics to beauty outcomes, the results of which also align with existing empirical studies. We expect the proposed framework for a broader application in causal inference.

**Exploring Memory Persistency Models for GPUs**

Given its high integration density, high speed, byte addressability, and low standby power, non-volatile or persistent memory is expected to supplement/replace DRAM as main memory. Through persistency programming models (which define durability ordering of stores) and durable transaction constructs, the programmer can provide recoverable data structure (RDS) which allows programs to recover to a consistent state after a failure. While persistency models have been well studied for CPUs, they have been neglected for graphics processing units (GPUs). Considering the importance of GPUs as a dominant accelerator for high performance computing, we investigate persistency models for GPUs. GPU applications exhibit substantial differences with CPUs applications, hence in this paper we adapt, re-architect, and optimize CPU persistency models for GPUs. We design a pragma-based compiler scheme to express persistency models for GPUs. We identify that the thread hierarchy in GPUs offers intuitive scopes to form epochs and durable transactions. We find that undo logging produces significant performance overheads. We propose to use idempotency analysis to reduce both logging frequency and the size of logs. Through both real-system and simulation evaluations, we show low overheads of our proposed architecture support.

**Computational Approaches to Access Probabilistic Population Codes for Higher Cognition an Decision-Making**

In recent years, research unveiled more and more evidence for the so-called Bayesian Brain Paradigm, i.e. the human brain is interpreted as a probabilistic inference machine and Bayesian modelling approaches are hence used successfully. One of the many theories is that of Probabilistic Population Codes (PPC). Although this model has so far only been considered as meaningful and useful for sensory perception as well as motor control, it has always been suggested that this mechanism also underlies higher cognition and decision-making. However, the adequacy of PPC for this regard cannot be confirmed by means of neurological standard measurement procedures. In this article we combine the parallel research branches of recommender systems and predictive data mining with theoretical neuroscience. The nexus of both fields is given by behavioural variability and resulting internal distributions. We adopt latest experimental settings and measurement approaches from predictive data mining to obtain these internal distributions, to inform the theoretical PPC approach and to deduce medical correlates which can indeed be measured in vivo. This is a strong hint for the applicability of the PPC approach and the Bayesian Brain Paradigm for higher cognition and human decision-making.

**Actional-Structural Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-based Action Recognition**

Action recognition with skeleton data has recently attracted much attention in computer vision. Previous studies are mostly based on fixed skeleton graphs, only capturing local physical dependencies among joints, which may miss implicit joint correlations. To capture richer dependencies, we introduce an encoder-decoder structure, called A-link inference module, to capture action-specific latent dependencies, i.e. actional links, directly from actions. We also extend the existing skeleton graphs to represent higher-order dependencies, i.e. structural links. Combing the two types of links into a generalized skeleton graph, we further propose the actional-structural graph convolution network (AS-GCN), which stacks actional-structural graph convolution and temporal convolution as a basic building block, to learn both spatial and temporal features for action recognition. A future pose prediction head is added in parallel to the recognition head to help capture more detailed action patterns through self-supervision. We validate AS-GCN in action recognition using two skeleton data sets, NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics. The proposed AS-GCN achieves consistently large improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods. As a side product, AS-GCN also shows promising results for future pose prediction.

**Self Training Autonomous Driving Agent**

Intrinsically, driving is a Markov Decision Process which suits well the reinforcement learning paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel agent which learns to drive a vehicle without any human assistance. We use the concept of reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies to train our agent in a 2D simulation environment. Our model’s architecture goes beyond the World Model’s by introducing difference images in the auto encoder. This novel involvement of difference images in the auto-encoder gives better representation of the latent space with respect to the motion of vehicle and helps an autonomous agent to learn more efficiently how to drive a vehicle. Results show that our method requires fewer (96% less) total agents, (87.5% less) agents per generations, (70% less) generations and (90% less) rollouts than the original architecture while achieving the same accuracy of the original.

**The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner: Interpreting Scenes, Words, and Sentences From Natural Supervision**

We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL), a model that learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of sentences without explicit supervision on any of them; instead, our model learns by simply looking at images and reading paired questions and answers. Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval.

**Hierarchical Context enabled Recurrent Neural Network for Recommendation**

A long user history inevitably reflects the transitions of personal interests over time. The analyses on the user history require the robust sequential model to anticipate the transitions and the decays of user interests. The user history is often modeled by various RNN structures, but the RNN structures in the recommendation system still suffer from the long-term dependency and the interest drifts. To resolve these challenges, we suggest HCRNN with three hierarchical contexts of the global, the local, and the temporary interests. This structure is designed to withhold the global long-term interest of users, to reflect the local sub-sequence interests, and to attend the temporary interests of each transition. Besides, we propose a hierarchical context-based gate structure to incorporate our \textit{interest drift assumption}. As we suggest a new RNN structure, we support HCRNN with a complementary \textit{bi-channel attention} structure to utilize hierarchical context. We experimented the suggested structure on the sequential recommendation tasks with CiteULike, MovieLens, and LastFM, and our model showed the best performances in the sequential recommendations.

**Reinforcement Learning Based Orchestration for Elastic Services**

Due to the highly variable execution context in which edge services run, adapting their behavior to the execution context is crucial to comply with their requirements. However, adapting service behavior is a challenging task because it is hard to anticipate the execution contexts in which it will be deployed, as well as assessing the impact that each behavior change will produce. In order to provide this adaptation efficiently, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Orchestration for Elastic Services. We implement and evaluate this approach by adapting an elastic service in different simulated execution contexts and comparing its performance to a Heuristics based approach. We show that elastic services achieve high precision and requirement satisfaction rates while creating an overhead of less than 0.5% to the overall service. In particular, the RL approach proves to be more efficient than its rule-based counterpart; yielding a 10 to 25% higher precision while being 25% less computationally expensive.

**A Distributed Method for Fitting Laplacian Regularized Stratified Models**

Stratified models are models that depend in an arbitrary way on a set of selected categorical features, and depend linearly on the other features. In a basic and traditional formulation a separate model is fit for each value of the categorical feature, using only the data that has the specific categorical value. To this formulation we add Laplacian regularization, which encourages the model parameters for neighboring categorical values to be similar. Laplacian regularization allows us to specify one or more weighted graphs on the stratification feature values. For example, stratifying over the days of the week, we can specify that the Sunday model parameter should be close to the Saturday and Monday model parameters. The regularization improves the performance of the model over the traditional stratified model, since the model for each value of the categorical `borrows strength’ from its neighbors. In particular, it produces a model even for categorical values that did not appear in the training data set. We propose an efficient distributed method for fitting stratified models, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). When the fitting loss functions are convex, the stratified model fitting problem is convex, and our method computes the global minimizer of the loss plus regularization; in other cases it computes a local minimizer. The method is very efficient, and naturally scales to large data sets or numbers of stratified feature values. We illustrate our method with a variety of examples.

**Discovering Common Change-Point Patterns in Functional Connectivity Across Subjects**

This paper studies change-points in human brain functional connectivity (FC) and seeks patterns that are common across multiple subjects under identical external stimulus. FC relates to the similarity of fMRI responses across different brain regions when the brain is simply resting or performing a task. While the dynamic nature of FC is well accepted, this paper develops a formal statistical test for finding {\it change-points} in times series associated with FC. It represents short-term connectivity by a symmetric positive-definite matrix, and uses a Riemannian metric on this space to develop a graphical method for detecting change-points in a time series of such matrices. It also provides a graphical representation of estimated FC for stationary subintervals in between the detected change-points. Furthermore, it uses a temporal alignment of the test statistic, viewed as a real-valued function over time, to remove inter-subject variability and to discover common change-point patterns across subjects. This method is illustrated using data from Human Connectome Project (HCP) database for multiple subjects and tasks.

**Dynamic Mini-batch SGD for Elastic Distributed Training: Learning in the Limbo of Resources**

With an increasing demand for training powers for deep learning algorithms and the rapid growth of computation resources in data centers, it is desirable to dynamically schedule different distributed deep learning tasks to maximize resource utilization and reduce cost. In this process, different tasks may receive varying numbers of machines at different time, a setting we call elastic distributed training. Despite the recent successes in large mini-batch distributed training, these methods are rarely tested in elastic distributed training environments and suffer degraded performance in our experiments, when we adjust the learning rate linearly immediately with respect to the batch size. One difficulty we observe is that the noise in the stochastic momentum estimation is accumulated over time and will have delayed effects when the batch size changes. We therefore propose to smoothly adjust the learning rate over time to alleviate the influence of the noisy momentum estimation. Our experiments on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation have demonstrated that our proposed Dynamic SGD method achieves stabilized performance when varying the number of GPUs from 8 to 128. We also provide theoretical understanding on the optimality of linear learning rate scheduling and the effects of stochastic momentum.

**Towards Data Poisoning Attack against Knowledge Graph Embedding**

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a technique for learning continuous embeddings for entities and relations in the knowledge graph. Due to its benefit to a variety of downstream tasks such as knowledge graph completion, question answering and recommendation, KGE has gained significant attention recently. Despite its effectiveness in a benign environment, KGE’ robustness to adversarial attacks is not well-studied. Existing attack methods on graph data cannot be directly applied to attack the embeddings of knowledge graph due to its heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we propose a collection of data poisoning attack strategies, which can effectively manipulate the plausibility of arbitrary targeted facts in a knowledge graph by adding or deleting facts on the graph. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack strategies are verified by extensive evaluations on two widely-used benchmarks.

**Survey on Automated Machine Learning**

Machine learning has become a vital part in many aspects of our daily life. However, building well performing machine learning applications requires highly specialized data scientists and domain experts. Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to reduce the demand for data scientists by enabling domain experts to automatically build machine learning applications without extensive knowledge of statistics and machine learning. In this survey, we summarize the recent developments in academy and industry regarding AutoML. First, we introduce a holistic problem formulation. Next, approaches for solving various subproblems of AutoML are presented. Finally, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of the presented approaches on synthetic and real data.

**Inductive Graph Pattern Learning for Recommender Systems Based on a Graph Neural Network**

Most modern successful recommender systems are based on matrix factorization techniques, i.e., learning a latent embedding for each user and each item from the given rating matrix and use the embeddings to complete the matrix. However, these learned latent embeddings are inherently transductive and are not designed to generalize to unseen users/items or new tasks. In this paper, we aim to learn an inductive model for recommender systems based on the local graph patterns around user-item pairs. The inductive model can generalize to unseen nodes/items, and potentially also transfer to other tasks. To learn such a model, we extract a local enclosing subgraph for each training (user, item) pair, and feed the subgraphs to a graph neural network (GNN) to train a rating prediction model. We show that our model achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art transductive methods, and is more stable when the rating matrix is sparse. Furthermore, our transfer learning experiment validates that the learned model is transferrable to new tasks.

**ABIDES: Towards High-Fidelity Market Simulation for AI Research**

We introduce ABIDES, an Agent-Based Interactive Discrete Event Simulation environment. ABIDES is designed from the ground up to support AI agent research in market applications. While simulations are certainly available within trading firms for their own internal use, there are no broadly available high-fidelity market simulation environments. We hope that the availability of such a platform will facilitate AI research in this important area. ABIDES currently enables the simulation of tens of thousands of trading agents interacting with an exchange agent to facilitate transactions. It supports configurable pairwise network latencies between each individual agent as well as the exchange. Our simulator’s message-based design is modeled after NASDAQ’s published equity trading protocols ITCH and OUCH. We introduce the design of the simulator and illustrate its use and configuration with sample code, validating the environment with example trading scenarios. The utility of ABIDES is illustrated through experiments to develop a market impact model. We close with discussion of future experimental problems it can be used to explore, such as the development of ML-based trading algorithms.

**Bayesian time-aligned factor analysis of paired multivariate time series**

Many modern data sets require inference methods that can estimate the shared and individual-specific components of variability in collections of matrices that change over time. Promising methods have been developed to analyze these types of data in static cases, but very few approaches are available for dynamic settings. To address this gap, we consider novel models and inference methods for pairs of matrices in which the columns correspond to multivariate observations at different time points. In order to characterize common and individual features, we propose a Bayesian dynamic factor modeling framework called Time Aligned Common and Individual Factor Analysis (TACIFA) that includes uncertainty in time alignment through an unknown warping function. We provide theoretical support for the proposed model, showing identifiability and posterior concentration. The structure enables efficient computation through a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. We show excellent performance in simulations, and illustrate the method through application to a social synchrony experiment.

**Several Experiments on Investigating Pretraining and Knowledge-Enhanced Models for Natural Language Inference**

Natural language inference (NLI) is among the most challenging tasks in natural language understanding. Recent work on unsupervised pretraining that leverages unsupervised signals such as language-model and sentence prediction objectives has shown to be very effective on a wide range of NLP problems. It would still be desirable to further understand how it helps NLI; e.g., if it learns artifacts in data annotation or instead learn true inference knowledge. In addition, external knowledge that does not exist in the limited amount of NLI training data may be added to NLI models in two typical ways, e.g., from human-created resources or an unsupervised pretraining paradigm. We runs several experiments here to investigate whether they help NLI in the same way, and if not,how?

**Incremental personalized E-mail spam filter using novel TFDCR feature selection with dynamic feature update**

Communication through e-mails remains to be highly formalized, conventional and indispensable method for the exchange of information over the Internet. An ever-increasing ratio and adversary nature of spam e-mails have posed a great many challenges such as uneven class distribution, unequal error cost, frequent change of content and personalized context-sensitive discrimination. In this research, we propose a novel and distinctive approach to develop an incremental personalized e-mail spam filter. The proposed work is described using three significant contributions. First, we applied a novel term frequency difference and category ratio based feature selection function TFDCR to select the most discriminating features irrespective of the number of samples in each class. Second, an incremental learning model is used which enables the classifier to update the discriminant function dynamically. Third, a heuristic function called selectionRankWeight is introduced to upgrade the existing feature set that determines new features carrying strong discriminating ability from an incoming set of e-mails. Three public e-mail datasets possessing different characteristics are used to evaluate the filter performance. Experiments are conducted to compare the feature selection efficiency of TFDCR and to observe the filter performance under both the batch and the incremental learning mode. The results demonstrate the superiority of TFDCR as the most effective f eature selection function. The incremental learning model incorporating dynamic feature update function overcomes the problem of drifting concepts. The proposed filter validates its efficiency and feasibility by substantially improving the classification accuracy and reducing the false positive error of misclassifying legitimate e-mail as spam.

**Regulating AI: do we need new tools?**

The Artificial Intelligence paradigm (hereinafter referred to as ‘AI’) builds on the analysis of data able, among other things, to snap pictures of the individuals’ behaviors and preferences. Such data represent the most valuable currency in the digital ecosystem, where their value derives from their being a fundamental asset in order to train machines with a view to developing AI applications. In this environment, online providers attract users by offering them services for free and getting in exchange data generated right through the usage of such services. This swap, characterized by an implicit nature, constitutes the focus of the present paper, in the light of the disequilibria, as well as market failures, that it may bring about. We use mobile apps and the related permission system as an ideal environment to explore, via econometric tools, those issues. The results, stemming from a dataset of over one million observations, show that both buyers and sellers are aware that access to digital services implicitly implies an exchange of data, although this does not have a considerable impact neither on the level of downloads (demand), nor on the level of the prices (supply). In other words, the implicit nature of this exchange does not allow market indicators to work efficiently. We conclude that current policies (e.g. transparency rules) may be inherently biased and we put forward suggestions for a new approach.

**A Socio-Informatic Approach to Automated Account Classification on Social Media**

Automated accounts on social media have become increasingly problematic. We propose a key feature in combination with existing methods to improve machine learning algorithms for bot detection. We successfully improve classification performance through including the proposed feature.

**PeyeDF: an Eye-Tracking Application for Reading and Self-Indexing Research**

PeyeDF is a Portable Document Format (PDF) reader with eye tracking support, available as free and open source software. It is especially useful to researchers investigating reading and learning phenomena, as it integrates PDF reading-related behavioural data with gaze-related data. It is suitable for short and long-term research and supports multiple eye tracking systems. We utilised it to conduct an experiment which demonstrated that features obtained from both gaze and reading data collected in the past can predict reading comprehension which takes place in the future. PeyeDF also provides an integrated means for data collection and indexing using the DiMe personal data storage system. It is designed to collect data in the background without interfering with the reading experience, behaving like a modern lightweight PDF reader. Moreover, it supports annotations, tagging and collaborative work. A modular design allows the application to be easily modified in order to support additional eye tracking protocols and run controlled experiments. We discuss the implementation of the software and report on the results of the experiment which we conducted with it.

**Sentiment Classification using N-gram IDF and Automated Machine Learning**

We propose a sentiment classification method with a general machine learning framework. For feature representation, n-gram IDF is used to extract software-engineering-related, dataset-specific, positive, neutral, and negative n-gram expressions. For classifiers, an automated machine learning tool is used. In the comparison using publicly available datasets, our method achieved the highest F1 values in positive and negative sentences on all datasets.

**Prediction with Unpredictable Feature Evolution**

Feature space can change or evolve when learning with streaming data. Several recent works have studied feature evolvable learning. They usually assume that features would not vanish or appear in an arbitrary way. For example, when knowing the battery lifespan, old features and new features represented by data gathered by sensors will disappear and emerge at the same time along with the sensors exchanging simultaneously. However, different sensors would have different lifespans, and thus the feature evolution can be unpredictable. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: Prediction with Unpredictable Feature Evolution (PUFE). We first complete the unpredictable overlapping period into an organized matrix and give a theoretical bound on the least number of observed entries. Then we learn the mapping from the completed matrix to recover the data from old feature space when observing the data from new feature space. With predictions on the recovered data, our model can make use of the advantage of old feature space and is always comparable with any combinations of the predictions on the current instance. Experiments on the synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

**Non-Local Context Encoder: Robust Biomedical Image Segmentation against Adversarial Attacks**

Recent progress in biomedical image segmentation based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has drawn much attention. However, its vulnerability towards adversarial samples cannot be overlooked. This paper is the first one that discovers that all the CNN-based state-of-the-art biomedical image segmentation models are sensitive to adversarial perturbations. This limits the deployment of these methods in safety-critical biomedical fields. In this paper, we discover that global spatial dependencies and global contextual information in a biomedical image can be exploited to defend against adversarial attacks. To this end, non-local context encoder (NLCE) is proposed to model short- and long range spatial dependencies and encode global contexts for strengthening feature activations by channel-wise attention. The NLCE modules enhance the robustness and accuracy of the non-local context encoding network (NLCEN), which learns robust enhanced pyramid feature representations with NLCE modules, and then integrates the information across different levels. Experiments on both lung and skin lesion segmentation datasets have demonstrated that NLCEN outperforms any other state-of-the-art biomedical image segmentation methods against adversarial attacks. In addition, NLCE modules can be applied to improve the robustness of other CNN-based biomedical image segmentation methods.

**Towards Automation of Creativity: A Machine Intelligence Approach**

This paper demonstrates emergence of computational creativity in the field of music. Different aspects of creativity such as producer, process, product and press are studied and formulated. Different notions of computational creativity such as novelty, quality and typicality of compositions as products are studied and evaluated. We formulate an algorithmic perception on human creativity and propose a prototype that is capable of demonstrating human-level creativity. We then validate the proposed prototype by applying various creativity benchmarks with the results obtained and compare the proposed prototype with the other existing computational creative systems.

**Graph Kernels: A Survey**

Graph kernels have attracted a lot of attention during the last decade, and have evolved into a rapidly developing branch of learning on structured data. During the past 20 years, the considerable research activity that occurred in the field resulted in the development of dozens of graph kernels, each focusing on specific structural properties of graphs. Graph kernels have proven successful in a wide range of domains, ranging from social networks to bioinformatics. The goal of this survey is to provide a unifying view of the literature on graph kernels. In particular, we present a comprehensive overview of a wide range of graph kernels. Furthermore, we perform an experimental evaluation of several of those kernels on publicly available datasets, and provide a comparative study. Finally, we discuss key applications of graph kernels, and outline some challenges that remain to be addressed.

**Collage Inference: Tolerating Stragglers in Distributed Neural Network Inference using Coding**

MLaaS (ML-as-a-Service) offerings by cloud computing platforms are becoming increasingly popular these days. Pre-trained machine learning models are deployed on the cloud to support prediction based applications and services. For achieving higher throughput, incoming requests are served by running multiple replicas of the model on different machines concurrently. Incidence of straggler nodes in distributed inference is a significant concern since it can increase inference latency, violate SLOs of the service. In this paper, we propose a novel coded inference model to deal with stragglers in distributed image classification. We propose modified single shot object detection models, Collage-CNN models, to provide necessary resilience efficiently. A Collage-CNN model takes collage images formed by combining multiple images as its input and performs multi-image classification in one shot. We generate custom training collages using images from standard image classification datasets and train the model to achieve high classification accuracy. Deploying the Collage-CNN models in the cloud, we demonstrate that the 99th percentile latency can be reduced by 1.45X to 2.46X compared to replication based approaches and without compromising prediction accuracy.

**Blockchain: Emerging Applications and Use Cases**

Blockchain also known as a distributed ledger technology stores different transactions/operations in a chain of blocks in a distributed manner without needing a trusted third-party. Blockchain is proven to be immutable which helps for integrity and accountability, and, to some extent, confidentiality through a pair of public and private keys. Blockchain has been in the spotlight after successful boom of the Bitcoin. There have been efforts to leverage salient features of Blockchain for different applications and use cases. This paper present a comprehensive survey of applications and use cases of Blockchain technology. Specifically, readers of this paper can have thorough understanding of applications and user cases of Blockchain technology.

**Fast Utility Mining on Complex Sequences**

High-utility sequential pattern mining is an emerging topic in the field of Knowledge Discovery in Databases. It consists of discovering subsequences having a high utility (importance) in sequences, referred to as high-utility sequential patterns (HUSPs). HUSPs can be applied to many real-life applications, such as market basket analysis, E-commerce recommendation, click-stream analysis and scenic route planning. For example, in economics and targeted marketing, understanding economic behavior of consumers is quite challenging, such as finding credible and reliable information on product profitability. Several algorithms have been proposed to address this problem by efficiently mining utility-based useful sequential patterns. Nevertheless, the performance of these algorithms can be unsatisfying in terms of runtime and memory usage due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space for low utility threshold and large databases. Hence, this paper proposes a more efficient algorithm for the task of high-utility sequential pattern mining, called HUSP-ULL. It utilizes a lexicographic sequence (LS)-tree and a utility-linked (UL)-list structure to fast discover HUSPs. Furthermore, two pruning strategies are introduced in HUSP-ULL to obtain tight upper-bounds on the utility of candidate sequences, and reduce the search space by pruning unpromising candidates early. Substantial experiments both on real-life and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently discover the complete set of HUSPs and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
