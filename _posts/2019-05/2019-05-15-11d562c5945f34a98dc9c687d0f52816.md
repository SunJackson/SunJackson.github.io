**Think Globally, Act Locally: A Deep Neural Network Approach to High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting**

Forecasting high-dimensional time series plays a crucial role in many applications such as demand forecasting and financial predictions. Modern real-world datasets can have millions of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e they are extremely high dimensional (one dimension for each individual time-series). Thus there is need for exploiting these global patterns and coupling them with local calibration for better prediction. However, most recent deep learning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e, even though they are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future forecast for a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension. In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep forecasting model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular, DeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix factorization model regularized by a temporal deep network with a local deep temporal model that captures patterns specific to each dimension. The global and local models are combined via a data-driven attention mechanism for each dimension. The proposed deep architecture used is a variation of temporal convolution termed as leveled network which can be trained effectively on high-dimensional but diverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different scales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results demonstrate that DeepGLO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets; for example, we see more than 30% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a real-world dataset that contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.

**Wearable Sensor Data Based Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning: A new approach**

Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensor data. One can find many practical applications in this area, especially in the field of health care. Many machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Multilayer Perceptron are successfully used in HAR. Although these methods are fast and easy for implementation, they still have some limitations due to poor performance in a number of situations. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the ensemble learning to boost the performance of these machine learning methods for HAR.

**Beta Survival Models**

This article analyzes the problem of estimating the time until an event occurs, also known as survival modeling. We observe through substantial experiments on large real-world datasets and use-cases that populations are largely heterogeneous. Sub-populations have different mean and variance in their survival rates requiring flexible models that capture heterogeneity. We leverage a classical extension of the logistic function into the survival setting to characterize unobserved heterogeneity using the beta distribution. This yields insights into the geometry of the problem as well as efficient estimation methods for linear, tree and neural network models that adjust the beta distribution based on observed covariates. We also show that the additional information captured by the beta distribution leads to interesting ranking implications as we determine who is most-at-risk. We show theoretically that the ranking is variable as we forecast forward in time and prove that pairwise comparisons of survival remain transitive. Empirical results using large-scale datasets across two use-cases (online conversions and retention modeling), demonstrate the competitiveness of the method. The simplicity of the method and its ability to capture skew in the data makes it a viable alternative to standard techniques particularly when we are interested in the time to event and when the underlying probabilities are heterogeneous.

**Differentially Private Learning with Adaptive Clipping**

We introduce a new adaptive clipping technique for training learning models with user-level differential privacy that removes the need for extensive parameter tuning. Previous approaches to this problem use the Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent or the Federated Averaging algorithm with noised updates, and compute a differential privacy guarantee using the Moments Accountant. These approaches rely on choosing a norm bound for each user’s update to the model, which needs to be tuned carefully. The best value depends on the learning rate, model architecture, number of passes made over each user’s data, and possibly various other parameters. We show that adaptively setting the clipping norm applied to each user’s update, based on a differentially private estimate of a target quantile of the distribution of unclipped norms, is sufficient to remove the need for such extensive parameter tuning.

**Charlotte: Composable Authenticated Distributed Data Structures, Technical Report**

We present Charlotte, a framework for composable, authenticated distributed data structures. Charlotte data is stored in blocks that reference each other by hash. Together, all Charlotte blocks form a directed acyclic graph, the blockweb; all observers and applications use subgraphs of the blockweb for their own data structures. Unlike prior systems, Charlotte data structures are composable: applications and data structures can operate fully independently when possible, and share blocks when desired. To support this composability, we define a language-independent format for Charlotte blocks and a network API for Charlotte servers. An authenticated distributed data structure guarantees that data is immutable and self-authenticating: data referenced will be unchanged when it is retrieved. Charlotte extends these guarantees by allowing applications to plug in their own mechanisms for ensuring availability and integrity of data structures. Unlike most traditional distributed systems, including distributed databases, blockchains, and distributed hash tables, Charlotte supports heterogeneous trust: different observers may have their own beliefs about who might fail, and how. Despite heterogeneity of trust, Charlotte presents each observer with a consistent, available view of data. We demonstrate the flexibility of Charlotte by implementing a variety of integrity mechanisms, including consensus and proof of work. We study the power of disentangling availability and integrity mechanisms by building a variety of applications. The results from these examples suggest that developers can use Charlotte to build flexible, fast, composable applications with strong guarantees.

**Exposure Interpolation Via Fusing Conventional and Deep Learning Methods**

Deep learning based methods have penetrated many image processing problems and become dominant solutions to these problems. A natural question raised here is ‘Is there any space for conventional methods on these problems?’ In this paper, exposure interpolation is taken as an example to answer this question and the answer is ‘Yes’. A framework on fusing conventional and deep learning method is introduced to generate an medium exposure image for two large-exposureratio images. Experimental results indicate that the quality of the medium exposure image is increased significantly through using the deep learning method to refine the interpolated image via the conventional method. The conventional method can be adopted to improve the convergence speed of the deep learning method and to reduce the number of samples which is required by the deep learning method.

**Dynamic principal component regression: Application to age-specific mortality forecasting**

In areas of application, including actuarial science and demography, it is increasingly common to consider a time series of curves; an example of this is age-specific mortality rates observed over a period of years. Given that age can be treated as a discrete or continuous variable, a dimension reduction technique, such as principal component analysis, is often implemented. However, in the presence of moderate to strong temporal dependence, static principal component analysis commonly used for analyzing independent and identically distributed data may not be adequate. As an alternative, we consider a \textit{dynamic} principal component approach to model temporal dependence in a time series of curves. Inspired by Brillinger’s (1974) theory of dynamic principal components, we introduce a dynamic principal component analysis, which is based on eigen-decomposition of estimated long-run covariance. Through a series of empirical applications, we demonstrate the potential improvement of one-year-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies that the dynamic principal component regression entails when compared with the static counterpart.

**Supporting Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Results with Contrastive Learning**

Dimensionality reduction (DR) is frequently used for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data as it provides a good first glance of the data. However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster’s characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method can calculate each feature’s relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With our cPCA-based method, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters’ feature contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and system with case studies using several publicly available datasets.

**Integrating Tensor Similarity to Enhance Clustering Performance**

Clustering aims to separate observed data into different categories. The performance of popular clustering models relies on the sample-to-sample similarity. However, the pairwise similarity is prone to be corrupted by noise or outliers and thus deteriorates the subsequent clustering. A high-order relationship among samples-to-samples may elaborate the local manifold of the data and thus provide complementary information to guide the clustering. However, few studies have investigated the connection between high-order similarity and usual pairwise similarity. To fill this gap, we first define a high-order tensor similarity to exploit the samples-to-samples affinity relationship. We then establish the connection between tensor similarity and pairwise similarity, proving that the decomposable tensor similarity is the Kronecker product of the usual pairwise similarity and the non-decomposable tensor similarity is generalized to provide complementary information, which pairwise similarity fails to regard. Finally, the high-order tensor similarity and pairwise similarity (IPS2) were integrated collaboratively to enhance clustering performance by enjoying their merits. The proposed IPS2 is shown to perform superior or competitive to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrated that tensor similarity is capable to boost the performance of the classical clustering method.

**Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Environments**

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn optimal decisions in the presence of a stationary environment. However, the stationary assumption on the environment is very restrictive. In many real world problems like traffic signal control, robotic applications, one often encounters situations with non-stationary environments and in these scenarios, RL methods yield sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we thus consider the problem of developing RL methods that obtain optimal decisions in a non-stationary environment. The goal of this problem is to maximize the long-term discounted reward achieved when the underlying model of the environment changes over time. To achieve this, we first adapt a change point algorithm to detect change in the statistics of the environment and then develop an RL algorithm that maximizes the long-run reward accrued. We illustrate that our change point method detects change in the model of the environment effectively and thus facilitates the RL algorithm in maximizing the long-run reward. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on non-stationary random Markov decision processes, a sensor energy management problem and a traffic signal control problem.

**Bayesian Optimized Continual Learning with Attention Mechanism**

Though neural networks have achieved much progress in various applications, it is still highly challenging for them to learn from a continuous stream of tasks without forgetting. Continual learning, a new learning paradigm, aims to solve this issue. In this work, we propose a new model for continual learning, called Bayesian Optimized Continual Learning with Attention Mechanism (BOCL) that dynamically expands the network capacity upon the arrival of new tasks by Bayesian optimization and selectively utilizes previous knowledge (e.g. feature maps of previous tasks) via attention mechanism. Our experiments on variants of MNIST and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art in preventing catastrophic forgetting and fitting new tasks better.

**Confidence intervals with maximal average power**

In this paper, we propose a frequentist testing procedure that maintains a defined coverage and is optimal in the sense that it gives maximal power to distinguish between hypotheses sampled from a pre-specified distribution (the prior distribution). Selecting a prior distribution allows to tune the decision rule. This leads to an increase of the power, if the true data generating distribution happens to be compatible with the prior. Similarly, it results in confidence intervals that are more precise, if the actually observed data happens to be compatible with the prior. It comes at the cost of losing power and having larger confidence intervals, if the data generating distribution or the observed data are incompatible with the prior. For constructing the testing procedure, the Bayesian posterior probability distribution is used. The proposed approach is simple to implement and does not rely on Minimax optimization. We illustrate the proposed approach for a binomial experiment, which is sufficiently simple such that the decision sets can be illustrated in figures, which should facilitate an intuitive understanding.

**Attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-view Environments**

In reinforcement learning algorithms, it is a common practice to account for only a single view of the environment to make the desired decisions; however, utilizing multiple views of the environment can help to promote the learning of complicated policies. Since the views may frequently suffer from partial observability, their provided observation can have different levels of importance. In this paper, we present a novel attention-based deep reinforcement learning method in a multi-view environment in which each view can provide various representative information about the environment. Specifically, our method learns a policy to dynamically attend to views of the environment based on their importance in the decision-making process. We evaluate the performance of our method on TORCS racing car simulator and three other complex 3D environments with obstacles.

**Predicting Path Failure In Time-Evolving Graphs**

In this paper we use a time-evolving graph which consists of a sequence of graph snapshots over time to model many real-world networks. We study the path classification problem in a time-evolving graph, which has many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, predicting path failure in a telecommunication network and predicting path congestion in a traffic network in the near future. In order to capture the temporal dependency and graph structure dynamics, we design a novel deep neural network named Long Short-Term Memory R-GCN (LRGCN). LRGCN considers temporal dependency between time-adjacent graph snapshots as a special relation with memory, and uses relational GCN to jointly process both intra-time and inter-time relations. We also propose a new path representation method named \underline{s}elf-\underline{a}ttentive \underline{p}ath \underline{e}mbedding (SAPE), to embed paths of arbitrary length into fixed-length vectors. Through experiments on a real-world telecommunication network and a traffic network in California, we demonstrate the superiority of LRGCN to other competing methods in path failure prediction, and prove the effectiveness of SAPE on path representation.

**A Complexity Analysis of Event-Triggered Model Predictive Control on Industrial Hardware**

We implement a recently proposed event-triggered networked MPC approach on industrial hardware to analyze its practical relevance. There exist several alternatives for such an implementation that differ with respect to the distribution of computational load between local and central nodes, and with respect to network bandwidth requirements. These alternatives have been analyzed theoretically before, but when implemented it becomes evident that their usefulness cannot be predicted based on theoretical considerations alone. It is the purpose of the present paper to account for both practical and theoretical aspects in determining which alternative is most appropriate for an implementation on industrial hardware. The smallest possible bandwidth is known to result for a variant in which only the active set of constraints is transmitted from the central to the local nodes. Since local nodes must determine the control law from the active set in this case, which requires matrix inversions, an unattractive computational cost results at first sight. Somewhat surprisingly, the computational cost scales practically linearly in the problem size when implemented. We confirm this result with a more detailed theoretical complexity analysis than given in previous papers. All results are illustrated with data obtained with an implementation on industrial hardware components.

**An Incremental Dimensionality Reduction Method for Visualizing Streaming Multidimensional Data**

Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are commonly used for analyzing and visualizing multidimensional data. However, when data is a live streaming feed, conventional DR methods cannot be directly used because of their computational complexity and inability to preserve the projected data positions at previous time points. In addition, the problem becomes even more challenging when the dynamic data records have a varying number of dimensions as often found in real-world applications. This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer’s mental map when visualizing the incremental results. Second, to handle data dimension variants, we use an optimization method to estimate the projected data positions, and also convey the resulting uncertainty in the visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design with two case studies using real-world datasets.

**A fast online cascaded regression algorithm for face alignment**

Traditional face alignment based on machine learning usually tracks the localizations of facial landmarks employing a static model trained offline where all of the training data is available in advance. When new training samples arrive, the static model must be retrained from scratch, which is excessively time-consuming and memory-consuming. In many real-time applications, the training data is obtained one by one or batch by batch. It results in that the static model limits its performance on sequential images with extensive variations. Therefore, the most critical and challenging aspect in this field is dynamically updating the tracker’s models to enhance predictive and generalization capabilities continuously. In order to address this question, we develop a fast and accurate online learning algorithm for face alignment. Particularly, we incorporate on-line sequential extreme learning machine into a parallel cascaded regression framework, coined incremental cascade regression(ICR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first incremental cascaded framework with the non-linear regressor. One main advantage of ICR is that the tracker model can be fast updated in an incremental way without the entire retraining process when a new input is incoming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ICR is more accurate and efficient on still or sequential images compared with the recent state-of-the-art cascade approaches. Furthermore, the incremental learning proposed in this paper can update the trained model in real time.

**Supervized Segmentation with Graph-Structured Deep Metric Learning**

We present a fully-supervized method for learning to segment data structured by an adjacency graph. We introduce the graph-structured contrastive loss, a loss function structured by a ground truth segmentation. It promotes learning vertex embeddings which are homogeneous within desired segments, and have high contrast at their interface. Thus, computing a piecewise-constant approximation of such embeddings produces a graph-partition close to the objective segmentation. This loss is fully backpropagable, which allows us to learn vertex embeddings with deep learning algorithms. We evaluate our methods on a 3D point cloud oversegmentation task, defining a new state-of-the-art by a large margin. These results are based on the published work of Landrieu and Boussaha 2019.

**Exact Adversarial Attack to Image Captioning via Structured Output Learning with Latent Variables**

In this work, we study the robustness of a CNN+RNN based image captioning system being subjected to adversarial noises. We propose to fool an image captioning system to generate some targeted partial captions for an image polluted by adversarial noises, even the targeted captions are totally irrelevant to the image content. A partial caption indicates that the words at some locations in this caption are observed, while words at other locations are not restricted.It is the first work to study exact adversarial attacks of targeted partial captions. Due to the sequential dependencies among words in a caption, we formulate the generation of adversarial noises for targeted partial captions as a structured output learning problem with latent variables. Both the generalized expectation maximization algorithm and structural SVMs with latent variables are then adopted to optimize the problem. The proposed methods generate very successful at-tacks to three popular CNN+RNN based image captioning models. Furthermore, the proposed attack methods are used to understand the inner mechanism of image captioning systems, providing the guidance to further improve automatic image captioning systems towards human captioning.

**Prototype Propagation Networks (PPN) for Weakly-supervised Few-shot Learning on Category Graph**

A variety of machine learning applications expect to achieve rapid learning from a limited number of labeled data. However, the success of most current models is the result of heavy training on big data. Meta-learning addresses this problem by extracting common knowledge across different tasks that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. However, they do not fully explore weakly-supervised information, which is usually free or cheap to collect. In this paper, we show that weakly-labeled data can significantly improve the performance of meta-learning on few-shot classification. We propose prototype propagation network (PPN) trained on few-shot tasks together with data annotated by coarse-label. Given a category graph of the targeted fine-classes and some weakly-labeled coarse-classes, PPN learns an attention mechanism which propagates the prototype of one class to another on the graph, so that the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier defined on the propagated prototypes results in high accuracy across different few-shot tasks. The training tasks are generated by subgraph sampling, and the training objective is obtained by accumulating the level-wise classification loss on the subgraph. The resulting graph of prototypes can be continually re-used and updated for new tasks and classes. We also introduce two practical test/inference settings which differ according to whether the test task can leverage any weakly-supervised information as in training. On two benchmarks, PPN significantly outperforms most recent few-shot learning methods in different settings, even when they are also allowed to train on weakly-labeled data.

**A Contrastive Divergence for Combining Variational Inference and MCMC**

We develop a method to combine Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), leveraging the advantages of both inference approaches. Specifically, we improve the variational distribution by running a few MCMC steps. To make inference tractable, we introduce the variational contrastive divergence (VCD), a new divergence that replaces the standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence used in VI. The VCD captures a notion of discrepancy between the initial variational distribution and its improved version (obtained after running the MCMC steps), and it converges asymptotically to the symmetrized KL divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior of interest. The VCD objective can be optimized efficiently with respect to the variational parameters via stochastic optimization. We show experimentally that optimizing the VCD leads to better predictive performance on two latent variable models: logistic matrix factorization and variational autoencoders (VAEs).

**Emergent Escape-based Flocking Behavior using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**

In nature, flocking or swarm behavior is observed in many species as it has beneficial properties like reducing the probability of being caught by a predator. In this paper, we propose SELFish (Swarm Emergent Learning Fish), an approach with multiple autonomous agents which can freely move in a continuous space with the objective to avoid being caught by a present predator. The predator has the property that it might get distracted by multiple possible preys in its vicinity. We show that this property in interaction with self-interested agents which are trained with reinforcement learning to solely survive as long as possible leads to flocking behavior similar to Boids, a common simulation for flocking behavior. Furthermore we present interesting insights in the swarming behavior and in the process of agents being caught in our modeled environment.

**The sharp, the flat and the shallow: Can weakly interacting agents learn to escape bad minima?**

An open problem in machine learning is whether flat minima generalize better and how to compute such minima efficiently. This is a very challenging problem. As a first step towards understanding this question we formalize it as an optimization problem with weakly interacting agents. We review appropriate background material from the theory of stochastic processes and provide insights that are relevant to practitioners. We propose an algorithmic framework for an extended stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and illustrate its potential. The paper is written as a tutorial, and presents an alternative use of multi-agent learning. Our primary focus is on the design of algorithms for machine learning applications; however the underlying mathematical framework is suitable for the understanding of large scale systems of agent based models that are popular in the social sciences, economics and finance.

**Design of Artificial Intelligence Agents for Games using Deep Reinforcement Learning**

In order perform a large variety of tasks and to achieve human-level performance in complex real-world environments, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents must be able to learn from their past experiences and gain both knowledge and an accurate representation of their environment from raw sensory inputs. Traditionally, AI agents have suffered from difficulties in using only sensory inputs to obtain a good representation of their environment and then mapping this representation to an efficient control policy. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have provided a solution to this issue. In this study, the performance of different conventional and novel deep reinforcement learning algorithms was analysed. The proposed method utilises two types of algorithms, one trained with a variant of Q-learning (DQN) and another trained with SARSA learning (DSN) to assess the feasibility of using direct feedback alignment, a novel biologically plausible method for back-propagating the error. These novel agents, alongside two similar agents trained with the conventional backpropagation algorithm, were tested by using the OpenAI Gym toolkit on several classic control theory problems and Atari 2600 video games. The results of this investigation open the way into new, biologically-inspired deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and their implementation on neuromorphic hardware.

**Neural-Guided RANSAC: Learning Where to Sample Model Hypotheses**

We present Neural-Guided RANSAC (NG-RANSAC), an extension to the classic RANSAC algorithm from robust optimization. NG-RANSAC uses prior information to improve model hypothesis search, increasing the chance of finding outlier-free minimal sets. Previous works use heuristic side-information like hand-crafted descriptor distance to guide hypothesis search. In contrast, we learn hypothesis search in a principled fashion that lets us optimize an arbitrary task loss during training, leading to large improvements on classic computer vision tasks. We present two further extensions to NG-RANSAC. Firstly, using the inlier count itself as training signal allows us to train neural guidance in a self-supervised fashion. Secondly, we combine neural guidance with differentiable RANSAC to build neural networks which focus on certain parts of the input data and make the output predictions as good as possible. We evaluate NG-RANSAC on a wide array of computer vision tasks, namely estimation of epipolar geometry, horizon line estimation and camera re-localization. We achieve superior or competitive results compared to state-of-the-art robust estimators, including very recent, learned ones.

**Single-Path NAS: Device-Aware Efficient ConvNet Design**

Can we automatically design a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) with the highest image classification accuracy under the latency constraint of a mobile device? Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for ConvNet design is a challenging problem due to the combinatorially large design space and search time (at least 200 GPU-hours). To alleviate this complexity, we propose Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable NAS method for designing device-efficient ConvNets in less than 4 hours. 1. Novel NAS formulation: our method introduces a single-path, over-parameterized ConvNet to encode all architectural decisions with shared convolutional kernel parameters. 2. NAS efficiency: Our method decreases the NAS search cost down to 8 epochs (30 TPU-hours), i.e., up to 5,000x faster compared to prior work. 3. On-device image classification: Single-Path NAS achieves 74.96% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms inference latency on a Pixel 1 phone, which is state-of-the-art accuracy compared to NAS methods with similar latency (<80ms).

**Multiple Independent Subspace Clusterings**

Multiple clustering aims at discovering diverse ways of organizing data into clusters. Despite the progress made, it’s still a challenge for users to analyze and understand the distinctive structure of each output clustering. To ease this process, we consider diverse clusterings embedded in different subspaces, and analyze the embedding subspaces to shed light into the structure of each clustering. To this end, we provide a two-stage approach called MISC (Multiple Independent Subspace Clusterings). In the first stage, MISC uses independent subspace analysis to seek multiple and statistical independent (i.e. non-redundant) subspaces, and determines the number of subspaces via the minimum description length principle. In the second stage, to account for the intrinsic geometric structure of samples embedded in each subspace, MISC performs graph regularized semi-nonnegative matrix factorization to explore clusters. It additionally integrates the kernel trick into matrix factorization to handle non-linearly separable clusters. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that MISC can find different interesting clusterings from the sought independent subspaces, and it also outperforms other related and competitive approaches on real-world datasets.

**Do Autonomous Agents Benefit from Hearing?**

Mapping states to actions in deep reinforcement learning is mainly based on visual information. The commonly used approach for dealing with visual information is to extract pixels from images and use them as state representation for reinforcement learning agent. But, any vision only agent is handicapped by not being able to sense audible cues. Using hearing, animals are able to sense targets that are outside of their visual range. In this work, we propose the use of audio as complementary information to visual only in state representation. We assess the impact of such multi-modal setup in reach-the-goal tasks in ViZDoom environment. Results show that the agent improves its behavior when visual information is accompanied with audio features.

**The Regression Tsetlin Machine: A Tsetlin Machine for Continuous Output Problems**

The recently introduced Tsetlin Machine (TM) has provided competitive pattern classification accuracy in several benchmarks, composing patterns with easy-to-interpret conjunctive clauses in propositional logic. In this paper, we go beyond pattern classification by introducing a new type of TMs, namely, the Regression Tsetlin Machine (RTM). In all brevity, we modify the inner inference mechanism of the TM so that input patterns are transformed into a single continuous output, rather than to distinct categories. We achieve this by: (1) using the conjunctive clauses of the TM to capture arbitrarily complex patterns; (2) mapping these patterns to a continuous output through a novel voting and normalization mechanism; and (3) employing a feedback scheme that updates the TM clauses to minimize the regression error. The feedback scheme uses a new activation probability function that stabilizes the updating of clauses, while the overall system converges towards an accurate input-output mapping. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using six different artificial datasets with and without noise. The performance of the RTM is compared with the Classical Tsetlin Machine (CTM) and the Multiclass Tsetlin Machine (MTM). Our empirical results indicate that the RTM obtains the best training and testing results for both noisy and noise-free datasets, with a smaller number of clauses. This, in turn, translates to higher regression accuracy, using significantly less computational resources.

**EdgeSegNet: A Compact Network for Semantic Segmentation**

In this study, we introduce EdgeSegNet, a compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of semantic segmentation. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create EdgeSegNet, where principled network design prototyping is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create networks with customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task. Experimental results showed that EdgeSegNet can achieve semantic segmentation accuracy comparable with much larger and computationally complex networks (>20x} smaller model size than RefineNet) as well as achieving an inference speed of ~38.5 FPS on an NVidia Jetson AGX Xavier. As such, the proposed EdgeSegNet is well-suited for low-power edge scenarios.

**Assuring the Machine Learning Lifecycle: Desiderata, Methods, and Challenges**

Machine learning has evolved into an enabling technology for a wide range of highly successful applications. The potential for this success to continue and accelerate has placed machine learning (ML) at the top of research, economic and political agendas. Such unprecedented interest is fuelled by a vision of ML applicability extending to healthcare, transportation, defence and other domains of great societal importance. Achieving this vision requires the use of ML in safety-critical applications that demand levels of assurance beyond those needed for current ML applications. Our paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in the assurance of ML, i.e. in the generation of evidence that ML is sufficiently safe for its intended use. The survey covers the methods capable of providing such evidence at different stages of the machine learning lifecycle, i.e. of the complex, iterative process that starts with the collection of the data used to train an ML component for a system, and ends with the deployment of that component within the system. The paper begins with a systematic presentation of the ML lifecycle and its stages. We then define assurance desiderata for each stage, review existing methods that contribute to achieving these desiderata, and identify open challenges that require further research.

**Automatic Programming of Cellular Automata and Artificial Neural Networks Guided by Philosophy**

Many computer models such as cellular automata have been developed and successfully applied. However, in some cases these models might be restrictive on the possible solutions or their solution is difficult to interpret. To overcome this problem, we outline an approach, the so-called allagmatic method, that automatically creates and programs models with as little limitations as possible but still maintaining human interpretability. We earlier described a meta-model and its building blocks according to the philosophical concepts of structure (spatial dimension) and operation (temporal dimension). They are entity, milieu, and update function that together abstractly describe the meta-model. By automatically combining these building blocks, new models can potentially be created in an evolutionary computation. We propose generic and object-oriented programming to implement the entities and their milieus as dynamic and generic arrays and the update function as a method. We show two experiments where a simple cellular automaton and an artificial neural network are automatically created and programmed. A target state is successfully evolved and learned in the cellular automaton and artificial neural network, respectively. We conclude that the allagmatic method can create and program cellular automaton and artificial neural network models in an automated manner.

**Why scoring functions cannot assess tail properties**

Motivated by the growing interest in sound forecast evaluation techniques with an emphasis on distribution tails rather than average behaviour, we investigate a fundamental question arising in this context: Can statistical features of distribution tails be elicitable, i.e. be the unique minimizer of an expected score? We demonstrate that expected scores are not suitable to distinguish genuine tail properties in a very strong sense. Specifically, we introduce the class of max-functionals, which contains key characteristics from extreme value theory, for instance the extreme value index. We show that its members fail to be elicitable and that their elicitation complexity is in fact infinite under mild regularity assumptions. Further we prove that, even if the information of a max-functional is reported via the entire distribution function, a proper scoring rule cannot separate max-functional values. These findings highlight the caution needed in forecast evaluation and statistical inference if relevant information is encoded by such functionals.

**Hybrid Predictive Model: When an Interpretable Model Collaborates with a Black-box Model**

Interpretable machine learning has become a strong competitor for traditional black-box models. However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an interpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency (defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.) Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an efficient trade-off between transparency and predictive performance, characterized by our proposed efficient frontiers.

**Interpreting and Evaluating Neural Network Robustness**

Recently, adversarial deception becomes one of the most considerable threats to deep neural networks. However, compared to extensive research in new designs of various adversarial attacks and defenses, the neural networks’ intrinsic robustness property is still lack of thorough investigation. This work aims to qualitatively interpret the adversarial attack and defense mechanism through loss visualization, and establish a quantitative metric to evaluate the neural network model’s intrinsic robustness. The proposed robustness metric identifies the upper bound of a model’s prediction divergence in the given domain and thus indicates whether the model can maintain a stable prediction. With extensive experiments, our metric demonstrates several advantages over conventional adversarial testing accuracy based robustness estimation: (1) it provides a uniformed evaluation to models with different structures and parameter scales; (2) it over-performs conventional accuracy based robustness estimation and provides a more reliable evaluation that is invariant to different test settings; (3) it can be fast generated without considerable testing cost.
