When we’d like to slice a dataframe by row, we can employ the split() function or the iter() function in the iterators package. 

By leveraging the power of parallelism, I wrote an utility function slice() to faster slice the dataframe. In the example shown below, the slice() is 3 times more efficient than the split() or the iter() to select 2 records out of 5,960 rows.
