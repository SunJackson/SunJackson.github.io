**advertorch** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
advertorch is a toolbox for adversarial robustness research. It contains various implementations for attacks, defenses and robust training methods. advertorch is built on PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), and leverages the advantages of the dynamic computational graph to provide concise and efficient reference implementations. The code is licensed under the LGPL license and is open sourced at https://…/advertorch . … 

**reductus** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The online data reduction service reductus transforms measurements in experimental science from laboratory coordinates into physically meaningful quantities with accurate estimation of uncertainties based on instrumental settings and properties. This reduction process is based on a few well-known transformations, but flexibility in the application of the transforms and algorithms supports flexibility in experiment design, supporting a broader range of measurements than a rigid reduction scheme for data. The user interface allows easy construction of arbitrary pipelines from well-known data transforms using a visual dataflow diagram. Source data is drawn from a networked, open data repository. The Python backend uses intelligent caching to store intermediate results of calculations for a highly responsive user experience. The reference implementation allows immediate reduction of measurements as they are recorded for the three neutron reflectometry instruments at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), without the need for visiting scientists to install additional software on their own computers. … 

**Generalized Complex-Valued Kernel Least-Mean-Square (gCKLMS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose a novel adaptive kernel based regression method for complex-valued signals: the generalized complex-valued kernel least-mean-square (gCKLMS). We borrow from the new results on widely linear reproducing kernel Hilbert space (WL-RKHS) for nonlinear regression and complex-valued signals, recently proposed by the authors. This paper shows that in the adaptive version of the kernel regression for complex-valued signals we need to include another kernel term, the so-called pseudo-kernel. This new solution is endowed with better representation capabilities in complex-valued fields, since it can efficiently decouple the learning of the real and the imaginary part. Also, we review previous realizations of the complex KLMS algorithm and its augmented version to prove that they can be rewritten as particular cases of the gCKLMS. Furthermore, important conclusions on the kernels design are drawn that help to greatly improve the convergence of the algorithms. In the experiments, we revisit the nonlinear channel equalization problem to highlight the better convergence of the gCKLMS compared to previous solutions. Also, the flexibility of the proposed generalized approach is tested in a second experiment with non-independent real and imaginary parts. The results illustrate the significant performance improvements of the gCKLMS approach when the complex-valued signals have different properties for the real and imaginary parts. …
