 Statistician, Median Salary: $84,760
 University Professor, Median Salary: $76,000
 Occupational Therapist, Median Salary: $83,200

Data Scientist was also ranked as 

2019 most promising job by LinkedIn in January 2019.


This comes as no surprise to KDnuggets readers, since Data Scientist was ranked as 
best job in America, 3 years in a row by Glassdoor,
and was among the 

top emerging jobs in the US according to LinkedIn back in 2017.


However, the total number of Data Scientist positions is still limited.
As of May 8, 

CareerCast shows 4,024 job listings for "Data Scientist",
Indeed.com has 5,366 jobs for "Data Scientist", and
GlassDoor shows 4,405 jobs for "Data Scientist".

*Note - you get many more jobs when omitting quotes from the search, but then you get listings for different scientists*.


While Data Science automation looms on the horizons, the next few years will be the golden age for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers.
