**From the course description:**

How can we measure something like “brand loyalty?” It’s an obvious measure of interest to marketers, but we can’t quite take a ruler to it. Instead, we can design and analyze a survey to indirectly measure such a so-called “latent construct.” In this course, you’ll learn how to design and analyze a marketing survey to describe and even predict customers’ behavior based on how they rate items on “a scale of 1 to 5.”

You’ll wrangle survey data, conduct exploratory & confirmatory factor analyses, and conduct various survey diagnostics such as checking for reliability and validity.
