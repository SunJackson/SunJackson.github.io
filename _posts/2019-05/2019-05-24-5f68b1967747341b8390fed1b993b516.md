We’re excited to team up with EODA, an RStudio Full Service Certified Partner, to host a free data science in production event in Frankfurt, Germany, on June 13. This one-day event will be geared for data science and IT teams that want to learn how to integrate their analysis solutions with the optimal IT infrastructure.

This is a great chance to work in smaller groups with experts from EODA and RStudio on best-practice approaches to productive data-science architectures, and to see real-world solutions to deployment problems.

With sessions in English and German, the conference will start with a high-level overview of the right interaction between data science and IT, and then focus on more hands-on solutions to engineering problems such as building APIs with Plumber and deploying to RStudio Connect, using Python and SQL in the RStudio IDE, and Shiny load testing.
