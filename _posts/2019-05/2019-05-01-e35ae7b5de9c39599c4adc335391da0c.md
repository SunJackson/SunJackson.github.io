One of the subjects that I teach in my undergraduate finance class is the relationship between risk and expected returns. In short, the riskier the investment, more returns should be **expected** by the investor. It is not a difficult argument to make. All that you need to understand is to remember that people are not naive in financial markets. Whenever they make a big gamble, the rewards should also be large. Rational investors, on theory, would not invest in risky stocks that are likelly to yield low returns.

Going further, one the arguments I make to support this idea is looking at historical data. By assuming that expected returns is the average yearly return rate on a stock and the risk is the standard deviation of the same returns, we can check for a positive relationship by plotting the data in a scatter plot.

In this post I’ll show how you can do it easily in R using `BatchGetSymbols`, `GetBCBData` and `tidyverse`.

First, we will gather and organize all data sets. Here I’m using the stock components of Ibovespa, the Brazilian market index, and also CDI, a common risk free rate in Brazil. The next code will:

1. Import the data

1. organize it in the same structure (same columns)

1. bind it all together


```
# get stock data
library(tidyverse)
library(BatchGetSymbols)
library(GetBCBData)

first.date <- '2008-01-01' # last date is Sys.Date by default

# get stock data
df.ibov <- GetIbovStocks()
mkt.idx <- c('^BVSP')
my.tickers <- c(mkt.idx, paste0(df.ibov$tickers, '.SA') )

df.prices <- BatchGetSymbols(tickers = my.tickers, first.date = first.date,
 freq.data = 'yearly', 
 be.quiet = TRUE)[[2]]

tab.stocks <- df.prices %>%
 na.omit() %>%
 group_by(ticker) %>%
 summarise(mean.ret = mean(ret.adjusted.prices),
 sd.ret = sd(ret.adjusted.prices)) %>%
 mutate(ticker = str_replace_all(ticker, fixed('.SA'), '') )

tab.mkt.idx <- tab.stocks %>%
 filter(ticker %in% mkt.idx)

tab.stocks <- tab.stocks %>%
 filter(!(ticker %in% mkt.idx))

# get CDI (risk free rate) 
my.id <- c(CDI = 4389)

tab.CDI <- gbcbd_get_series(my.id, first.date = first.date) %>%
 rename(ticker = series.name ) %>%
 mutate(ref.date = format(ref.date, '%Y'),
 value = value/100) %>%
 group_by(ref.date, ticker) %>%
 summarise(ret = mean(value)) %>%
 group_by(ticker) %>%
 summarise(mean.ret = mean(ret),
 sd.ret = sd(ret))
```

Now that we have the data, lets use `ggplot` to build our graph.

```
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(tab.stocks, aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, group = ticker)) + 
 geom_point() + 
 geom_text(data = tab.stocks, aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, label = ticker), nudge_y = 0.03,
 check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_x = 0.05 ) + 
 geom_point(data = tab.CDI, aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, color = ticker), size =5) +
 geom_point(data = tab.mkt.idx, 
 aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, color = ticker), size =5) +
 labs(x = 'Risk (standard deviation)', y ='Expected Returns (average)', 
 title = 'Mean X Variance map for B3',
 subtitle = paste0(nrow(tab.stocks), ' stocks, ', lubridate::year(min(df.prices$ref.date)), 
 ' - ', lubridate::year(max(df.prices$ref.date)))) + 
 scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
 scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) 

print(p)
```

Looks pretty! What do we learn?


Overall, most of the stocks did better than the risk free rate (CDI);


There is a positive relationship between risk and return. The higher the standard deviation (x-axis), the higher the mean of returns (y-axis). However, notice that it is not a perfect relationship. If we followed the mean-variance gospel, there are lots of opportunities of arbitrage. We would mostly invest in those stocks in the upper-left part of the plot;


Surprisingly, the market index, Ibovespa (^BVSP), is not well positioned in the graph. Since it is a diversified portfolio, I expected it to be closer to the frontier, around stock EQTL3.
