## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it isaimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful aswell. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, wewill introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. inbase R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader iscomfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we willlearn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages byprobing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?

- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?

- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?


In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple emailvalidation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of thetopics in the second section.

### Why

Regular expressions can be used for:

- search

- replace

- validation

- extraction

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_why.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


### Use Cases

Regular expressions have applications in a wide range of areas. We list some ofthe most popular ones below:

- email validation

- password validation

- date validation

- phone number validation

- search and replace in text editors

- web scraping

## Learning

The below steps offer advice on the best way to learn or use regular expressions:

- describe the pattern in layman terms

break down the pattern into individual components

- match each component to a regular expression

- build incrementally

- test

## Libraries

We will use the following libraries in this post:

```
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Data

We will use two data sets in this post. The first one is a list of all Rpackages on CRAN and is present in the `package_names.csv` file, and thesecond one, `top_downloads`, is the most downloaded packages from theRStudio CRAN mirrorin the first week of May 2019, and extracted using thecranlogs pacakge.

### R Packages Data

```
read_csv("package_names.csv") %>%
 pull(1) -> r_packages 
```

### Top R Packages

```
top_downloads <- c("devtools", "rlang", "dplyr", "Rcpp", "tibble", 
 "ggplot2", "glue", "pillar", "cli", "data.table")

top_downloads
```

```
## [1] "devtools" "rlang" "dplyr" "Rcpp" "tibble" 
## [6] "ggplot2" "glue" "pillar" "cli" "data.table"
```

## Pattern Matching Functions

Before we get into the nitty gritty of regular expressions, let us explore afew functions from base R for pattern matching. We will learn about usingregular expressions with the stringr package in an upcoming post.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_base_functions.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_base_functions.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


## grep

The first function we will learn is `grep()`. It can be used to find elementsthat match a given pattern in a character vector. It will return the elementsor the index of the elements based on your specification. In the below example,`grep()` returns the index of the elements that match the given pattern.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_index_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_index_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r")
```

```
## [1] 2 3 8
```

Now let us look at the inputs:

- `pattern`

- `x`

- `ignore.case`

- `value`

- `invert`


## grep – Value

If you want `grep()` to return the element instead of the index, set the`value` argument to `TRUE`. The default is `FALSE`. In the below example,`grep()` returns the elements and not their index.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_value_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_value_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "rlang" "dplyr" "pillar"
```

## grep – Ignore Case

If you have carefully observed the previous examples, have you noticed thatthe pattern `r` did not match the element `Rcpp` i.e. regular expressions arecase sensitive. The `ignore.case` argument will ignore case while matching thepattern as shown below.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_ignore_case_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_ignore_case_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "rlang" "dplyr" "Rcpp" "pillar"
```

```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "R", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "Rcpp"
```

```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "R", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "rlang" "dplyr" "Rcpp" "pillar"
```

## grep – Invert

In some cases, you may want to retrieve elements that do not match the patternspecified. The `invert` argument will return the elements that do not matchthe pattern. In the below example, the elements returned do not match thepattern specified by us.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_invert_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grep_invert_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "devtools" "Rcpp" "tibble" "ggplot2" "glue" 
## [6] "cli" "data.table"
```

```
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r", value = TRUE, 
 invert = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "devtools" "tibble" "ggplot2" "glue" "cli" 
## [6] "data.table"
```

## grepl

`grepl()` will return only logical values. If the elements match the patternspecified, it will return `TRUE` else `FALSE`.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grepl_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grepl_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grepl(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r")
```

```
## [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

### Ignore Case

To ignore the case, use the `ignore.case` argument and set it to `TRUE`.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grepl_ignore_case_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_grepl_ignore_case_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grepl(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r", ignore.case = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

The next 3 functions that we explore differ from the above 2 in the format ofand amount of details in the results. They all return the following additionaldetails:

- the starting position of the first match

- the length of the matched text

- whether the match position and length are in chracter or bytes


### regexpr

```
rr_pkgs <- c("purrr", "olsrr", "blorr")
regexpr("r", rr_pkgs)
```

```
## [1] 3 4 4
## attr(,"match.length")
## [1] 1 1 1
## attr(,"index.type")
## [1] "chars"
## attr(,"useBytes")
## [1] TRUE
```

### gregexpr

```
gregexpr("r", rr_pkgs)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 3 4 5
## attr(,"match.length")
## [1] 1 1 1
## attr(,"index.type")
## [1] "chars"
## attr(,"useBytes")
## [1] TRUE
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 4 5
## attr(,"match.length")
## [1] 1 1
## attr(,"index.type")
## [1] "chars"
## attr(,"useBytes")
## [1] TRUE
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 4 5
## attr(,"match.length")
## [1] 1 1
## attr(,"index.type")
## [1] "chars"
## attr(,"useBytes")
## [1] TRUE
```

## sub

`sub()` will perform replacement of the first match. In the below example,you can observe that only the first match of `r` is replaced by `s` whilethe rest remain the same.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_sub_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_sub_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
rr_pkgs <- c("purrr", "olsrr", "blorr")
sub(x = rr_pkgs, pattern = "r", replacement = "s")
```

```
## [1] "pusrr" "olssr" "blosr"
```

## gsub

`gsub()` will perform replacement of all the matches. In the below example,all the `s` are replaced by `r`. Compare the below output with the output from`sub()` to understand the difference between them.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_gsub_canva.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_gsub_canva.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
gsub(x = rr_pkgs, pattern = "r", replacement = "s")
```

```
## [1] "pusss" "olsss" "bloss"
```

## Regular Expressions

So far we have been exploring R functions for pattern matching with a verysimple pattern i.e. a single character. From this section, we will startexploring different scenarios and the corresponding regular expressions. Thissection is further divided into 5 sub sections:

- anchors

- metacharacters

- quantifiers

- sequences

- and character classes


## Sequences

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_sequences.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_sequences.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


#### Digit Character

`\\d` matches any digit character. Let us use it to find package names thatinclude a digit.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_digit.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_digit.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)

```
# invert
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\d", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)[1:50]
```

```
## [1] "abbyyR" "abc" "abc.data"

In the next few examples, we will not use R package names data, instead we willuse dummy data of Invoice IDs and see if they conform to certain rules such as:

- they should include letters and numbers

- they should not include symbols

- they should not include space or tab


#### Non Digit Character

`\\D` matches any non-digit character. Let us use it to remove invoice ids thatinclude only numbers and no letters.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_non_digit.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_non_digit.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


As you can see below, thre are 3 invoice ids that did not conform to the rulesand have been removed. Only those invoice ids that have both letter and numbershave been returned.

```
invoice_id <- c("R536365", "R536472", "R536671", "536915", "R536125", "R536287",
 "536741", "R536893", "R536521", "536999")
grep(x = invoice_id, pattern = "\\D", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "R536365" "R536472" "R536671" "R536125" "R536287" "R536893" "R536521"
```

```
# invert
grep(x = invoice_id, pattern = "\\D", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "536915" "536741" "536999"
```

#### White Space Character

`\\s` matches any white space character such as space or tab. Let us use it todetect invoice ids that include any white space (space or tab).

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_space.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_space.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


As you can see below, there are 4 invoice ids that include white spacecharacter.

```
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", "R536671", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
 "536741", "R5368 93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
 pattern = "\\s", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "R 536472" "R53 6125" "R5368 93" "536 999"
```

```
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", "R536671", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
 "536741", "R5368 93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
 pattern = "\\s", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "R536365" "R536671" "R536915" "R536287" "536741" "R536521"
```

#### Non White Space Character

`\\S` matches any non white space character. Let us use it to remove anyinvoice ids which are blank or missing.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_non_space.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_non_space.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


As you can see below, two invoice ids which were blank have been removed. If youobserve carefully, it does not remove any invoice ids which have a white spacecharacter present, it only removes those which are completely blank i.e. thosewhich include only space or tab.

```
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", " ", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
 " ", "R5368 93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
 pattern = "\\S", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "R536365" "R 536472" "R536915" "R53 6125" "R536287" "R5368 93"
## [7] "R536521" "536 999"
```

```
# invert
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", " ", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
 " ", "R5368 93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
 pattern = "\\S", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] " " " "
```

#### Word Character

`\\w` matches any word character i.e. alphanumeric. It includes the following:

- a to z

- A to Z

- 0 to 9

- underscore(_)


![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_word.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_word.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us use it to remove those invoice ids which include only symbols or specialcharacters. Again, you can see that it does not remove those ids which includeboth word characters and symbols as it will match any string that includesword characters.

```
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#[email protected]?", "[email protected]",
 "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
 pattern = "\\w", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "R536365" "R536671" "R536915" "[email protected]" "53+67$41" "R536893" 
## [7] "536#999"
```

```
# invert
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#[email protected]?", "[email protected]",
 "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
 pattern = "\\w", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "%+$!#@?" "$%+#[email protected]?" "@$+%#!"
```

#### Non Word Character

`\\W` matches any non-word character i.e. symbols. It includes everything thatis not a word character.

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_non_word.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_match_non_word.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us use it to detect invoice ids that include any non-word character. As youcan see only 4 ids do not include non-word characters.

```
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#[email protected]?", "[email protected]",
 "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
 pattern = "\\W", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "%+$!#@?" "$%+#[email protected]?" "[email protected]" "53+67$41" "@$+%#!" "536#999"
```

```
# invert
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#[email protected]?", "[email protected]",
 "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
 pattern = "\\W", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "R536365" "R536671" "R536915" "R536893"
```

## Word Boundary

`\\b` and `\\B` are similar to caret and dollar symbol. They match at a positioncalled word boundary. Now, what is a word boundary? The following 3 positionsqualify as word boundaries:

- before the first character in the string

- after the last character in the string

- between two characters in the string


In the first 2 cases, the character must be a word character whereas in thelast case, one should be a word character and another non-word character. Soundsconfusing? It will be clear once we go through a few examples.

Let us say we are looking for package names beginning with the string `stat`.In this case, we can prefix `stat` with `\\b`.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_word_boundary_1.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_word_boundary_1.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


```
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\bstat", value = TRUE) 
```

```
## [1] "haplo.stats" "statar" "statcheck" "statebins" 
## [5] "states" "statGraph" "stationery" "statip" 
## [9] "statmod" "statnet" "statnet.common" "statnetWeb" 
## [13] "statprograms" "statquotes" "stats19" "statsDK" 
## [17] "statsr" "statVisual"
```

Suffix `\\b` to `stat` to look at all package names that end with the string`stat`.

![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_word_boundary_2.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_word_boundary_2.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


If you observe the output, you can find package names that do not end withthe string `stat`. `spatstat.data`, `spatstat.local` and `spatstat.utils` do notend with `stat` but satisfy the third condition mentioned aboved for wordboundaries. They are between 2 characters where `t` is a word character and dotis a non-word character.

```
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "stat\\b", value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "Blendstat" "costat" "dstat" 
## [4] "eurostat" "gstat" "hierfstat"

Prefix and suffix `\\B` to `stat` to look at package names that include thestring `stat` but neither in the beginning nor in the end.

In the below output, you can observe that the string `stat` must be betweentwo word characters. Those examples we showed in the case of `\\b` where itwas surrounded by a dot do not hold here.

```
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\Bstat\\B", value = TRUE)
```

## Case Studies

Now that we have understood the basics of regular expressions, it is time forsome practical application. The case studies in this section include validatingthe following:

- blood group

- email id

- PAN number

- GST number


Note, the regular expressions used here are not robust as compared to thoseused in real world applications. Our aim is to demonstrate a general strategyto used while dealing with regular expressions.

### Blood Group

According to Wikipedia, a blood group or type is a classification of blood basedon the presence and absence of antibodies and inherited antigenic substances onthe surface of red blood cells (RBCs).

![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_blood_groups.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_blood_groups.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


The below table defines the matching pattern for blood group and maps them toregular expressions.

- it must begin with `A`, `B`, `AB` or `O`

- it must end with `+` or `-`


![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_bg_table.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_bg_table.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us test the regular expression with some examples.

```
blood_pattern <- "^(A|B|AB|O)[-|+]$"
blood_sample <- c("A+", "C-", "AB+")
grep(x = blood_sample, pattern = blood_pattern, value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "A+" "AB+"
```

### email id

Nowadays email is ubiquitous. We use it for everything from communication toregistration for online services. Wherever you go, you will be asked for emailid. You might even be denied a few services if you do not use email. At the sametime, it is important to validate a email address. You might have seen a messagesimilar to the below one when you misspell or enter a wrong email id. Regularexpressions are used to validate email address and in this case study we willattempt to do the same.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_email.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_email.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


First, we will create some basic rules for simple email validation:

- it must begin with a letter

- the id may include letters, numbers and special characters

- must include only one @ and dot

- the id must be to the left of @

- the domain name should be between @ and dot

- the domain extension should be after dot and must include only letters


In the below table, we map the above rules to general expression.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_email_table.png?w=100%25&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_email_table.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us now test the regular expression with some dummy email ids.

```
email_pattern <- "^[a-zA-Z0-9\\!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-][email protected][a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-z]"
emails <- c("[email protected]", "[email protected]", "test-test.com")
grep(x = emails, pattern = email_pattern, value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "[email protected]"
```

### PAN Number Validation

PAN (Permanent Account Number) is an identification number assigned to alltaxpayers in India. PAN is an electronic system through which, all tax relatedinformation for a person/company is recorded against a single PAN number.

### GST Number Validation

In simple words, Goods and Service Tax (GST) is an indirect tax levied on thesupply of goods and services. This law has replaced many indirect tax laws thatpreviously existed in India. GST identification number is assigned to everyGST registed dealer.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_gst.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


#### Structure

Below is the format break down of GST identification number:

- it must include 15 characters only

- the first 2 characters represent the state code and is a sequence from 01 to 35

- the next 10 characters are the PAN number of the entity

- the 13th character is the entity code and is between 1 and 9

- the 14th character is a default alphabet, **Z**

- the 15th character is a random single number or alphabet


In the below table, we map the pattern to regular expression.

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.rsquaredacademy.com/img/regex_cs_gst_table.png?w=100%25&ssl=1)


Let us test the regular expression with some dummy GST numbers.

```
gst_pattern <- "[0-3][1-5][A-Z]{3}(A|B|C|F|G|H|L|J|P|T|E)[A-Z][0-9]{4}[A-Z][1-9]Z[0-9A-Z]"
sample_gst <- c("22AAAAA0000A1Z5", "22AAAAA0000A1Z", "42AAAAA0000A1Z5",
 "38AAAAA0000A1Z5", "22AAAAA0000A0Z5", "22AAAAA0000A1X5",
 "22AAAAA0000A1Z$")
grep(x = sample_gst, pattern = gst_pattern, value = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "22AAAAA0000A1Z5"
```

## RStudio Addin

Garrick Aden-Buiehas created a wonderful RStudio addin, RegExplainand you will find it very useful while learning and building regular expressions.

## Other Applications

- R variable names

- R file names and extensions

- password validation

- camelcase

- currency format

- date of birth

- date validation

- decimal number

- full name / first name

- html tags

- https url

- phone number

- ip address

- month name


## What we have not covered?

While we have covered a lot, the below topics have been left out:

- flags

- grouping and capturing

- back references

- look ahead and look behind


You may want to explore them to up your regular expressions game.

## Summary

- a regular expression is a special text for identifying a pattern

- it can be used to search, replace, validate and extract strings matching agiven pattern

- use cases include email and password validation, search and replace in texteditors, html tags validation, web scraping etc.
