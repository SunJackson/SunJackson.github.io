“When answering big business questions, the statistically-minded, yet communicative data scientist is first needed to translate the business problem into the required analytic approach, both in terms of the available data and the algorithms required.• What data is available to answer the question?• Do we need ­all of the data to answer the question?• Does it require a complex algorithm with lots of variables?• How often and how quickly does the analysis need updates?• How ‘up-to-date’ do the inputs need to be?• How complete are the inputs in predicting a particular event?• How much variance remains unaccounted for?” Andrew Pease ( November 3, 2014 )
