Last week the R package ruimtehol was updated on CRAN giving R users who perform Natural Language Processing access to the possibility to

- Allow to do semi-supervised learning (learning where you have both text as labels but not always both of them on the same document identifier.

- Allow to do transfer learning by passing on an embedding matrix (e.g. obtained via fasttext or Glove or the like) and keep on training based on that matrix or just use the embeddings in your Natural Language Processing flow.


More information can be found in the package vignette shown below or which you can obtain by installing the package and visiting the vignette with the following R code. Enjoy!
