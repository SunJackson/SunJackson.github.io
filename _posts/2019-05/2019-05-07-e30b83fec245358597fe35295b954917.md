(TL;DR: Vectors are ordered lists of numbers.)

Lasttime,we learnt about **scalars**. We’ll now start learning about**vectors!**

## What’s a Vector?

A vector is essentially **a list of numbers!** They’re normallydepicted as **columns of numbers (i.e. as column vectors)**:


The **order in which each number appears** in our vector is important.For example:


However:


We can **transpose** vectors so that the **rows become columns**, or so that**the columns become rows**. We’ll use an upper case “T” to denote the**transpose operator**:


We now have ourselves a **row vector!** Applying the transpose operationon our row vector brings us right back to where we started:


A tiny bit of notation
We will use the notation from *Goodfellow, Ian, etal.* and refer to vectors usinglower case, bold letters:


The **individual elements** of our vectors are often called**elements, components or entries**. We’ll follow *Goodfellow, Ian,et al.* and call them**elements**. We’ll refer to the element of our vector using an **italicised** witha **subscript** indicating the element number:


For example, we’ll represent the second element of our vector like this:


How can we represent vectors in R?
Common vector types
We have many vector types in R. The vector types that I most commonly use are these:

### Common vector types

- numeric,

- character, and

- logical


### Coercing them vectors

In R, **all elements of our vectors must be of the same type.** If asingle element in our vectors violates this condition, the entire vectoris coerced into a **more generic class**. For example, this results inan **integer vector**:

```
x <- c(2L, 3L, 5L)
class(x)

```

However, this results in a **numeric vector**:

```
x <- c(2L, 3L, 5L, 7)
class(x)

```

This makes sense as we learnt in partonethat our set of integers, , is a subset of our set of realnumbers, . That is:


The symbol means **“is a proper/strict subset of”**. Itindicates that all elements of the set on the left are contained withinthe set on the right.

This means that we can represent both our integers and real numbers in a single vector of type `numeric`. However, we can’t represent all of our real numbers in a vector type of `integer`.

### How can we create vectors?

We can create vectors by using the `c()` function. For example, here isa **numeric vector**:

```
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
print(x)

```

Notice that when we print it out, it looks like a **row vector**.However, when we use our vector in a `data.frame`, we get this:

```
x_df <- data.frame(x)
print(x_df)

```

```
## x
## 1 1
## 2 2
## 3 3

```

Looks like a column to me! *(Note: The numbers in the column on the left are row numbers)*

If we then transpose it, we get this:

```
x_df_transposed <- t(x_df)
print(x_df_transposed)

```

```
## [,1] [,2] [,3]
## x 1 2 3

```

Looks like a row vector now! Exciting! If we transpose it again, we’reback to a column vector:

```
## x
## [1,] 1
## [2,] 2
## [3,] 3

```



Vectors are ordered lists of numbers. We transposed the hell out of one.

Next time, we’ll **combine** our knowledge of scalars with our new knowledgeof vectors!
