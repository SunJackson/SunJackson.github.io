- If target-color is equal to replacement-color, return.

- If the color of node is not equal to target-color, return.

- Set the color of node to replacement-color.

- Perform **Flood-fill** (one step to the south of node, target-color, replacement-color).Perform **Flood-fill** (one step to the north of node, target-color, replacement-color).Perform **Flood-fill** (one step to the west of node, target-color, replacement-color).Perform **Flood-fill** (one step to the east of node, target-color, replacement-color).

- Return.

The translation into R couldn’t be any easier:

We take the image from Wikipedia as an example:

We now fill the three areas with three different colours and then plot the image again:

This seems to work pretty well but the problem is that the more nested the algorithm becomes the bigger the *stack* has to be – which could lead to overflow errors. One comment on my original post on recursion read:

> 
just keep in mind that recursion is useful in industrial work only if tail optimization is supported. otherwise your code will explode at some indeterminate time in the future. […]


One possibility is to increase the size of the stack with `options(expressions = 10000)` but even this may not be enough. Therefore we transform our recursive algorithm into a loop-based one and use a *queue* instead of a stack! The pseudocode from Wikipedia:

---

- If target-color is equal to replacement-color, return.

- If color of node is not equal to target-color, return.

- Set the color of node to replacement-color.

- Set Q to the empty queue.

- Add node to the end of Q.

- While Q is not empty:


- Set n equal to the first element of Q.

- Remove first element from Q.

- If the color of the node to the west of n is target-color,set the color of that node to replacement-color and add that node to the end of Q.

- If the color of the node to the east of n is target-color,set the color of that node to replacement-color and add that node to the end of Q.

- If the color of the node to the north of n is target-color,set the color of that node to replacement-color and add that node to the end of Q.

- If the color of the node to the south of n is target-color,set the color of that node to replacement-color and add that node to the end of Q.

Because of the way the algorithm fills areas it is also called *forest fire*. Again, the translation into valid R code is straightforward:

As an example we will use a much bigger picture (it can be downloaded from here: Unfilledcirc.png):

And now for the filling:

As you can see, with this version of the algorithm much bigger areas can be filled!

I also added both R implementations to the respective section of Rosetta Code: Bitmap/Flood fill.
