“Io-Tahoe is excited to join the OneTrust Data Discovery Partner Program. Data privacy continues to define business strategy and day-to-day operations for many organizations; and OneTrust has assumed a significant role in helping companies privatize and secure their data”, said Rohit Mahajan, Io-Tahoe’s Chief Technology and Product Officer. By using OneTrust and Io-Tahoe together, organizations will be better equipped to automatically discover and manage their PII and sensitive data in response to privacy compliance requirements.”


Io-Tahoe has emerged as a leader in the smart data discovery space through its introduction of innovations such as Smart Streaming Discovery, which enables firms to perform real-time data discovery on a wide range of streaming data. The capability believed to be the first of its kind, allows Io-Tahoe’s customers to discover PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and other sensitive data “in motion”, enabling continuous automated data governance and regulatory compliance. Companies dealing with the increasing number of global privacy regulations such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) will have the ability to discover PII and sensitive data in motion and take a proactive approach to risk management and increase their overall regulatory compliance.
