Structure() function is a simple, yet powerful function that describes a given object with given attributes. It is part of base R language library, so there is no need to load any additional library. And also, since the function was part of S-Language, it is in the base library from the earlier versions, making it backward or forward compatible.

Example:

All objects created using structure() â€“ whether homogeneous (matrix, vector) or heterogeneous (data.frame, list) â€“ have additional metadata information stored, using attributes. Like creating a simple vector with additional metadata information:

And by using function:

We get the information back:

### In one go

So, let us suppose you want to create a structure (S3) in one step. The following would create a data.frame (heterogeneous) with several steps:

Using structure, we can do this simpler and faster:

 

Useful cases when using structure() function are:

- when creating a smaller data-set within your Jupyter notebook (using Markdown )

- when creating data-sets within your R code demo/example (and not using external CSV / TXT / JSON files)

- when describing a given object with mixed data types (e.i.: data frame) and prepare it for data import

- when creating many R environments and each have independent data-set

- for persisting data

- and many moreâ€¦


Constructing data-frame with additional attributes and comments.

Nesting lists within lists can also be done, or even preserving the original data-sets as sub-list, hidden from the dataframe, can also be an option.

And checking comments can be done as:

 

Both yield same results, as:

 

This simple, yet very useful code example with effective function is as always, available at Github.
