### Workshop Description

This afternoon workshop launches your tenure as a user of R, the well-known open-source platform for data science and machine learning. The workshop stands alone as the perfect way to get started with R, or may serve to prepare for the more advanced full-day hands-on workshop, “R for Predictive Modeling”.Designed for newcomers to the language of R, “R Bootcamp” covers the R ecosystem and core elements of the language, so you attain the foundations for becoming an R user. Topics include common tools for data import, manipulation and export. If time allows, other topics will be covered, such: as graphical systems in R (e.g. LATTICE and GGPLOT) and automated reporting.The instructor will guide attendees on hands-on execution with R, covering:

- A working knowledge of the R system

- The strengths and limitations of the R language

- Core language features

- The best tools for merging, processing and arranging data


Hardware: **Bring Your Own Laptop**Each workshop participant is required to bring their own laptop running Windows or OS X. The software used during this training program, R, is free and readily available for download.Attendees receive an electronic copy of the course materials and related R code at the conclusion of the workshop.
