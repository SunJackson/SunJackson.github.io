**T-EDGE: Temporal WEighted MultiDiGraph Embedding for Ethereum Transaction Network Analysis**

Recently, graph embedding techniques have been widely used in the analysis of various networks, but most of the existing embedding methods omit the temporal and weighted information of edges which may be contributing in financial transaction networks. The open nature of Ethereum, a blockchain-based platform, gives us an unprecedented opportunity for data mining in this area. By taking the realistic rules and features of transaction networks into consideration, we propose to model the Ethereum transaction network as a Temporal Weighted Multidigraph (TWMDG) where each node is a unique Ethereum account and each edge represents a transaction weighted by amount and assigned with timestamp. In a TWMDG, we define the problem of Temporal Weighted Multidigraph Embedding (T-EDGE) by incorporating both temporal and weighted information of the edges, the purpose being to capture more comprehensive properties of dynamic transaction networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed embedding method, we conduct experiments of predictive tasks, including temporal link prediction and node classification, on real-world transaction data collected from Ethereum. Experimental results demonstrate that T-EDGE outperforms baseline embedding methods, indicating that time-dependent walks and multiplicity characteristic of edges are informative and essential for time-sensitive transaction networks.

**Power of the Few: Analyzing the Impact of Influential Users in Collaborative Recommender Systems**

Like other social systems, in collaborative filtering a small number of ‘influential’ users may have a large impact on the recommendations of other users, thus affecting the overall behavior of the system. Identifying influential users and studying their impact on other users is an important problem because it provides insight into how small groups can inadvertently or intentionally affect the behavior of the system as a whole. Modeling these influences can also shed light on patterns and relationships that would otherwise be difficult to discern, hopefully leading to more transparency in how the system generates personalized content. In this work we first formalize the notion of ‘influence’ in collaborative filtering using an Influence Discrimination Model. We then empirically identify and characterize influential users and analyze their impact on the system under different underlying recommendation algorithms and across three different recommendation domains: job, movie and book recommendations. Insights from these experiments can help in designing systems that are not only optimized for accuracy, but are also tuned to mitigate the impact of influential users when it might lead to potential imbalance or unfairness in the system’s outcomes.

**Clustered Multitask Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data**

In this paper, the new algorithm based on clustered multitask network is proposed to solve spectral unmixing problem in hyperspectral imagery. In the proposed algorithm, the clustered network is employed. Each pixel in the hyperspectral image considered as a node in this network. The nodes in the network are clustered using the fuzzy c-means clustering method. Diffusion least mean square strategy has been used to optimize the proposed cost function. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments are conducted on synthetic and real datasets. Simulation results based on spectral angle distance, abundance angle distance and reconstruction error metrics illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm compared with other methods.

**Control Theory Meets POMDPs: A Hybrid Systems Approach**

Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a modeling framework for a variety of sequential decision making under uncertainty scenarios in artificial intelligence (AI). Since the states are not directly observable in a POMDP, decision making has to be performed based on the output of a Bayesian filter (continuous beliefs). Hence, POMDPs are often computationally intractable to solve exactly and researchers resort to approximate methods often using discretizations of the continuous belief space. These approximate solutions are, however, prone to discretization errors, which has made POMDPs ineffective in applications, wherein guarantees for safety, optimality, or performance are required. To overcome the complexity challenge of POMDPs, we apply notions from control theory. The goal is to determine the reachable belief space of a POMDP, that is, the set of all possible evolutions given an initial belief distribution over the states and a set of actions and observations. We begin by casting the problem of analyzing a POMDP into analyzing the behavior of a discrete-time switched system. For estimating the reachable belief space, we find over-approximations in terms of sub-level sets of Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, in order to verify safety and optimality requirements of a given POMDP, we formulate a barrier certificate theorem, wherein we show that if there exists a barrier certificate satisfying a set of inequalities along with the belief update equation of the POMDP, the safety and optimality properties are guaranteed to hold. In both cases, we show how the calculations can be decomposed into smaller problems that can be solved in parallel. The conditions we formulate can be computationally implemented as a set of sum-of-squares programs. We illustrate the applicability of our method by addressing two problems in active ad scheduling and machine teaching.

**Be Your Own Teacher: Improve the Performance of Convolutional Neural Networks via Self Distillation**

Convolutional neural networks have been widely deployed in various application scenarios. In order to extend the applications’ boundaries to some accuracy-crucial domains, researchers have been investigating approaches to boost accuracy through either deeper or wider network structures, which brings with them the exponential increment of the computational and storage cost, delaying the responding time. In this paper, we propose a general training framework named self distillation, which notably enhances the performance (accuracy) of convolutional neural networks through shrinking the size of the network rather than aggrandizing it. Different from traditional knowledge distillation – a knowledge transformation methodology among networks, which forces student neural networks to approximate the softmax layer outputs of pre-trained teacher neural networks, the proposed self distillation framework distills knowledge within network itself. The networks are firstly divided into several sections. Then the knowledge in the deeper portion of the networks is squeezed into the shallow ones. Experiments further prove the generalization of the proposed self distillation framework: enhancement of accuracy at average level is 2.65%, varying from 0.61% in ResNeXt as minimum to 4.07% in VGG19 as maximum. In addition, it can also provide flexibility of depth-wise scalable inference on resource-limited edge devices.Our codes will be released on github soon.

**The Unexpected Unexpected and the Expected Unexpected: How People’s Conception of the Unexpected is Not That Unexpected**

The answers people give when asked to ‘think of the unexpected’ for everyday event scenarios appear to be more expected than unexpected. There are expected unexpected outcomes that closely adhere to the given information in a scenario, based on familiar disruptions and common plan-failures. There are also unexpected unexpected outcomes that are more inventive, that depart from given information, adding new concepts/actions. However, people seem to tend to conceive of the unexpected as the former more than the latter. Study 1 tests these proposals by analysing the object-concepts people mention in their reports of the unexpected and the agreement between their answers. Study 2 shows that object-choices are weakly influenced by recency, the order of sentences in the scenario. The implications of these results for ideas in philosophy, psychology and computing is discussed

**Graph Mining Meets Crowdsourcing: Extracting Experts for Answer Aggregation**

Aggregating responses from crowd workers is a fundamental task in the process of crowdsourcing. In cases where a few experts are overwhelmed by a large number of non-experts, most answer aggregation algorithms such as the majority voting fail to identify the correct answers. Therefore, it is crucial to extract reliable experts from the crowd workers. In this study, we introduce the notion of ‘expert core’, which is a set of workers that is very unlikely to contain a non-expert. We design a graph-mining-based efficient algorithm that exactly computes the expert core. To answer the aggregation task, we propose two types of algorithms. The first one incorporates the expert core into existing answer aggregation algorithms such as the majority voting, whereas the second one utilizes information provided by the expert core extraction algorithm pertaining to the reliability of workers. We then give a theoretical justification for the first type of algorithm. Computational experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed answer aggregation algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms.

**Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for Multi-Agent Intelligence**

Learning agents that are not only capable of taking tests but also innovating is becoming the next hot topic in AI. One of the most promising paths towards this vision is multi-agent learning, where agents act as the environment for each other, and improving each agent means proposing new problems for the others. However, existing evaluation platforms are either not compatible with multi-agent settings, or limited to a specific game. That is, there is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent intelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform for multi-agent intelligence with \NumGames games of diverse logic and representations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. Thus, we provide a building toolkit for researchers to invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the provided game set with little efforts. Finally, we provide python implementations of five state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with the baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we can train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for evaluating agents with population performance, so that the research community can perform comparisons under a stable and uniform standard.

**Alpha MAML: Adaptive Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning**

Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a meta-learning technique to train a model on a multitude of learning tasks in a way that primes the model for few-shot learning of new tasks. The MAML algorithm performs well on few-shot learning problems in classification, regression, and fine-tuning of policy gradients in reinforcement learning, but comes with the need for costly hyperparameter tuning for training stability. We address this shortcoming by introducing an extension to MAML, called Alpha Model-agnostic meta-learning, to incorporate an online hyperparameter adaptation scheme that eliminates the need to tune meta-learning and learning rates. Our results with the Omniglot database demonstrate a substantial reduction in the need to tune MAML training hyperparameters and improvement to training stability with less sensitivity to hyperparameter choice.

**A Fast and Scalable Implementation Method for Competing Risks Data with the R Package fastcmprsk**

Advancements in medical informatics tools and high-throughput biological experimentation make large-scale biomedical data routinely accessible to researchers. Competing risks data are typical in biomedical studies where individuals are at risk to more than one cause (type of event) which can preclude the others from happening. The Fine-Gray model is a popular and well-appreciated model for competing risks data and is currently implemented in a number of statistical software packages. However, current implementations are not computationally scalable for large-scale competing risks data. We have developed an R package, fastcmprsk, that uses a novel forward-backward scan algorithm to significantly reduce the computational complexity for parameter estimation by exploiting the structure of the subject-specific risk sets. Numerical studies compare the speed and scalability of our implementation to current methods for unpenalized and penalized Fine-Gray regression and show impressive gains in computational efficiency.

**AutoDispNet: Improving Disparity Estimation with AutoML**

Much research work in computer vision is being spent on optimizing existing network architectures to obtain a few more percentage points on benchmarks. Recent AutoML approaches promise to relieve us from this effort. However, they are mainly designed for comparatively small-scale classification tasks. In this work, we show how to use and extend existing AutoML techniques to efficiently optimize large-scale U-Net-like encoder-decoder architectures. In particular, we leverage gradient-based neural architecture search and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search. The resulting optimization does not require a large company-scale compute cluster. We show results on disparity estimation that clearly outperform the manually optimized baseline and reach state-of-the-art performance.

**Graph-based Semi-Supervised & Active Learning for Edge Flows**

We present a graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for learning edge flows defined on a graph. Specifically, given flow measurements on a subset of edges, we want to predict the flows on the remaining edges. To this end, we develop a computational framework that imposes certain constraints on the overall flows, such as (approximate) flow conservation. These constraints render our approach different from classical graph-based SSL for vertex labels, which posits that tightly connected nodes share similar labels and leverages the graph structure accordingly to extrapolate from a few vertex labels to the unlabeled vertices. We derive bounds for our method’s reconstruction error and demonstrate its strong performance on synthetic and real-world flow networks from transportation, physical infrastructure, and the Web. Furthermore, we provide two active learning algorithms for selecting informative edges on which to measure flow, which has applications for optimal sensor deployment. The first strategy selects edges to minimize the reconstruction error bound and works well on flows that are approximately divergence-free. The second approach clusters the graph and selects bottleneck edges that cross cluster-boundaries, which works well on flows with global trends.

**Multilinear Compressive Learning**

Compressive Learning is an emerging topic that combines signal acquisition via compressive sensing and machine learning to perform inference tasks directly on a small number of measurements. Many data modalities naturally have a multi-dimensional or tensorial format, with each dimension or tensor mode representing different features such as the spatial and temporal information in video sequences or the spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral images. However, in existing compressive learning frameworks, the compressive sensing component utilizes either random or learned linear projection on the vectorized signal to perform signal acquisition, thus discarding the multi-dimensional structure of the signals. In this paper, we propose Multilinear Compressive Learning, a framework that takes into account the tensorial nature of multi-dimensional signals in the acquisition step and builds the subsequent inference model on the structurally sensed measurements. Our theoretical complexity analysis shows that the proposed framework is more efficient compared to its vector-based counterpart in both memory and computation requirement. With extensive experiments, we also empirically show that our Multilinear Compressive Learning framework outperforms the vector-based framework in object classification and face recognition tasks, and scales favorably when the dimensionalities of the original signals increase, making it highly efficient for high-dimensional multi-dimensional signals.

**Sequential training algorithm for neural networks**

A sequential training method for large-scale feedforward neural networks is presented. Each layer of the neural network is decoupled and trained separately. After the training is completed for each layer, they are combined together. The performance of the network would be sub-optimal compared to the full network training if the optimal solution would be achieved. However, achieving the optimal solution for the full network would be infeasible or require long computing time. The proposed sequential approach reduces the required computer resources significantly and would have better convergences as a single layer is optimised for each optimisation step. The required modifications of existing algorithms to implement the sequential training are minimal. The performance is verified by a simple example.

**Enforcing constraints for time series prediction in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning**

We assume that we are given a time series of data from a dynamical system and our task is to learn the flow map of the dynamical system. We present a collection of results on how to enforce constraints coming from the dynamical system in order to accelerate the training of deep neural networks to represent the flow map of the system as well as increase their predictive ability. In particular, we provide ways to enforce constraints during training for all three major modes of learning, namely supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. In general, the dynamic constraints need to include terms which are analogous to memory terms in model reduction formalisms. Such memory terms act as a restoring force which corrects the errors committed by the learned flow map during prediction. For supervised learning, the constraints are added to the objective function. For the case of unsupervised learning, in particular generative adversarial networks, the constraints are introduced by augmenting the input of the discriminator. Finally, for the case of reinforcement learning and in particular actor-critic methods, the constraints are added to the reward function. In addition, for the reinforcement learning case, we present a novel approach based on homotopy of the action-value function in order to stabilize and accelerate training. We use numerical results for the Lorenz system to illustrate the various constructions.

**Story Ending Prediction by Transferable BERT**

Recent advances, such as GPT and BERT, have shown success in incorporating a pre-trained transformer language model and fine-tuning operation to improve downstream NLP systems. However, this framework still has some fundamental problems in effectively incorporating supervised knowledge from other related tasks. In this study, we investigate a transferable BERT (TransBERT) training framework, which can transfer not only general language knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data but also specific kinds of knowledge from various semantically related supervised tasks, for a target task. Particularly, we propose utilizing three kinds of transfer tasks, including natural language inference, sentiment classification, and next action prediction, to further train BERT based on a pre-trained model. This enables the model to get a better initialization for the target task. We take story ending prediction as the target task to conduct experiments. The final result, an accuracy of 91.8%, dramatically outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline methods. Several comparative experiments give some helpful suggestions on how to select transfer tasks. Error analysis shows what are the strength and weakness of BERT-based models for story ending prediction.

**Cross-referencing using Fine-grained Topic Modeling**

Cross-referencing, which links passages of text to other related passages, can be a valuable study aid for facilitating comprehension of a text. However, cross-referencing requires first, a comprehensive thematic knowledge of the entire corpus, and second, a focused search through the corpus specifically to find such useful connections. Due to this, cross-reference resources are prohibitively expensive and exist only for the most well-studied texts (e.g. religious texts). We develop a topic-based system for automatically producing candidate cross-references which can be easily verified by human annotators. Our system utilizes fine-grained topic modeling with thousands of highly nuanced and specific topics to identify verse pairs which are topically related. We demonstrate that our system can be cost effective compared to having annotators acquire the expertise necessary to produce cross-reference resources unaided.

**Factor Models for High-Dimensional Tensor Time Series**

Large tensor (multi-dimensional array) data are now routinely collected in a wide range of applications, due to modern data collection capabilities. Often such observations are taken over time, forming tensor time series. In this paper we present a factor model approach for analyzing high-dimensional dynamic tensor time series and multi-category dynamic transport networks. Two estimation procedures along with their theoretical properties and simulation results are presented. Two applications are used to illustrate the model and its interpretations.

**Which Tasks Should Be Learned Together in Multi-task Learning?**

Many computer vision applications require solving multiple tasks in real-time. A neural network can be trained to solve multiple tasks simultaneously using `multi-task learning’. This saves computation at inference time as only a single network needs to be evaluated. Unfortunately, this often leads to inferior overall performance as task objectives compete, which consequently poses the question: which tasks should and should not be learned together in one network when employing multi-task learning? We systematically study task cooperation and competition and propose a framework for assigning tasks to a few neural networks such that cooperating tasks are computed by the same neural network, while competing tasks are computed by different networks. Our framework offers a time-accuracy trade-off and can produce better accuracy using less inference time than not only a single large multi-task neural network but also many single-task networks.

**Gradient tree boosting with random output projections for multi-label classification and multi-output regression**

In many applications of supervised learning, multiple classification or regression outputs have to be predicted jointly. We consider several extensions of gradient boosting to address such problems. We first propose a straightforward adaptation of gradient boosting exploiting multiple output regression trees as base learners. We then argue that this method is only expected to be optimal when the outputs are fully correlated, as it forces the partitioning induced by the tree base learners to be shared by all outputs. We then propose a novel extension of gradient tree boosting to specifically address this issue. At each iteration of this new method, a regression tree structure is grown to fit a single random projection of the current residuals and the predictions of this tree are fitted linearly to the current residuals of all the outputs, independently. Because of this linear fit, the method can adapt automatically to any output correlation structure. Extensive experiments are conducted with this method, as well as other algorithmic variants, on several artificial and real problems. Randomly projecting the output space is shown to provide a better adaptation to different output correlation patterns and is therefore competitive with the best of the other methods in most settings. Thanks to model sharing, the convergence speed is also improved, reducing the computing times (or the complexity of the model) to reach a specific accuracy.

**RaFM: Rank-Aware Factorization Machines**

Factorization machines (FM) are a popular model class to learn pairwise interactions by a low-rank approximation. Different from existing FM-based approaches which use a fixed rank for all features, this paper proposes a Rank-Aware Factorization machine (RaFM) model which adopts pairwise interactions from embeddings with different ranks. The proposed model achieves a better performance on real-world datasets where different features have significantly varying frequencies of occurrences. Moreover, we prove that the RaFM model can be stored, evaluated, and trained as efficiently as one single FM, and under some reasonable conditions it can be even significantly more efficient than FM. RaFM improves the performance of FMs in both regression tasks and classification tasks while incurring less computational burden, therefore also has attractive potential in industrial applications.

**The Curious Case of Machine Learning In Malware Detection**

In this paper, we argue that machine learning techniques are not ready for malware detection in the wild. Given the current trend in malware development and the increase of unconventional malware attacks, we expect that dynamic malware analysis is the future for antimalware detection and prevention systems. A comprehensive review of machine learning for malware detection is presented. Then, we discuss how malware detection in the wild present unique challenges for the current state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We defined three critical problems that limit the success of malware detectors powered by machine learning in the wild. Next, we discuss possible solutions to these challenges and present the requirements of next-generation malware detection. Finally, we outline potential research directions in machine learning for malware detection.

**Microblog Hashtag Generation via Encoding Conversation Contexts**

Automatic hashtag annotation plays an important role in content understanding for microblog posts. To date, progress made in this field has been restricted to phrase selection from limited candidates, or word-level hashtag discovery using topic models. Different from previous work considering hashtags to be inseparable, our work is the first effort to annotate hashtags with a novel sequence generation framework via viewing the hashtag as a short sequence of words. Moreover, to address the data sparsity issue in processing short microblog posts, we propose to jointly model the target posts and the conversation contexts initiated by them with bidirectional attention. Extensive experimental results on two large-scale datasets, newly collected from English Twitter and Chinese Weibo, show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models based on classification. Further studies demonstrate our ability to effectively generate rare and even unseen hashtags, which is however not possible for most existing methods.

**Semantic flow in language networks**

In this study we propose a framework to characterize documents based on their semantic flow. The proposed framework encompasses a network-based model that connected sentences based on their semantic similarity. Semantic fields are detected using standard community detection methods. as the story unfolds, transitions between semantic fields are represent in Markov networks, which in turned are characterized via network motifs (subgraphs). Here we show that the proposed framework can be used to classify books according to their style and publication dates. Remarkably, even without a systematic optimization of parameters, philosophy and investigative books were discriminated with an accuracy rate of 92.5%. Because this model captures semantic features of texts, it could be used as an additional feature in traditional network-based models of texts that capture only syntactical/stylistic information, as it is the case of word adjacency (co-occurrence) networks.

**Evolving Rewards to Automate Reinforcement Learning**

**A Case Study: Exploiting Neural Machine Translation to Translate CUDA to OpenCL**

The sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for neural machine translation has significantly improved the accuracy of language translation. There have been new efforts to use this seq2seq model for program language translation or program comparisons. In this work, we present the detailed steps of using a seq2seq model to translate CUDA programs to OpenCL programs, which both have very similar programming styles. Our work shows (i) a training input set generation method, (ii) pre/post processing, and (iii) a case study using Polybench-gpu-1.0, NVIDIA SDK, and Rodinia benchmarks.

**Quantifying Robotic Swarm Coverage**

In the field of swarm robotics, the design and implementation of spatial density control laws has received much attention, with less emphasis being placed on performance evaluation. This work fills that gap by introducing an error metric that provides a quantitative measure of coverage for use with any control scheme. The proposed error metric is continuously sensitive to changes in the swarm distribution, unlike commonly used discretization methods. We analyze the theoretical and computational properties of the error metric and propose two benchmarks to which error metric values can be compared. The first uses the realizable extrema of the error metric to compute the relative error of an observed swarm distribution. We also show that the error metric extrema can be used to help choose the swarm size and effective radius of each robot required to achieve a desired level of coverage. The second benchmark compares the observed distribution of error metric values to the probability density function of the error metric when robot positions are randomly sampled from the target distribution. We demonstrate the utility of this benchmark in assessing the performance of stochastic control algorithms. We prove that the error metric obeys a central limit theorem, develop a streamlined method for performing computations, and place the standard statistical tests used here on a firm theoretical footing. We provide rigorous theoretical development, computational methodologies, numerical examples, and MATLAB code for both benchmarks.

**On Selecting Stable Predictors in Time Series Models**

We extend the feature selection methodology to dependent data and propose a novel time series predictor selection scheme that accommodates statistical dependence in a more typical i.i.d sub-sampling based framework. Furthermore, the machinery of mixing stationary processes allows us to quantify the improvements of our approach over any base predictor selection method (such as lasso) even in a finite sample setting. Using the lasso as a base procedure we demonstrate the applicability of our methods to simulated and several real time series datasets.

**Regions In a Linked Dataset For Change Detection**

Linked Datasets (LDs) are constantly evolving and the applications using a Linked Dataset (LD) may face several issues such as outdated data or broken interlinks due to evolution of the dataset. To overcome these issues, the detection of changes in LDs during their evolution has proven crucial. As LDs evolve frequently, the change detection during the evolution should also be done at frequent intervals. However, due to limitation of available computational resources such as capacity to fetch data from LD and time to detect changes, the frequent change detection may not be possible with existing change detection techniques. This research proposes to explore the notion of prioritization of regions (subsets) in LDs for change detection with the aim of achieving optimal accuracy and efficient use of available computational resources. This will facilitate the detection of changes in an evolving LD at frequent intervals and will allow the applications to update their data closest to real-time data.

**Things You May Not Know About Adversarial Example: A Black-box Adversarial Image Attack**

Numerous methods for crafting adversarial examples were proposed recently with high attack success rate. Most of the existing works normalize images into a continuous vector, domain firstly, and then craft adversarial examples in the continuous vector space. However, ‘adversarial’ examples may become benign after de-normalizing them back into discrete integer domain, known as the discretization problem. The discretization problem was mentioned in some work, but was despised and have received relatively little attention. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of this discretization problem. We theoretically analyzed 34 representative methods and empirically studied 20 representative open source tools for crafting discretization images. Our findings reveal that almost all of existing works suffer from the discretization problem and the problem is far more serious than we thought. This suggests that the discretization problem should be taken into account when crafting adversarial examples. As a first step towards addressing the discretization problem, we propose a black-box attack method to encode the adversarial example searching problem as a derivative-free optimization problem. Our method is able to craft ‘real” adversarial images by derivative-free search on the discrete integer domain. Experimental results show that our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates on the discrete integer domain than most of the other tools, no matter white-box or black-box. Moreover, our method is able to handle any model that is not differentiable and we successfully break the winner of NIPS 17 competition on defense with a 95\% success rate.

**Learning to Memorize in Neural Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**

In this thesis, we leverage the neural copy mechanism and memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) to address existing challenge of neural task-oriented dialogue learning. We show the effectiveness of our strategy by achieving good performance in multi-domain dialogue state tracking, retrieval-based dialogue systems, and generation-based dialogue systems. We first propose a transferable dialogue state generator (TRADE) that leverages its copy mechanism to get rid of dialogue ontology and share knowledge between domains. We also evaluate unseen domain dialogue state tracking and show that TRADE enables zero-shot dialogue state tracking and can adapt to new few-shot domains without forgetting the previous domains. Second, we utilize MANNs to improve retrieval-based dialogue learning. They are able to capture dialogue sequential dependencies and memorize long-term information. We also propose a recorded delexicalization copy strategy to replace real entity values with ordered entity types. Our models are shown to surpass other retrieval baselines, especially when the conversation has a large number of turns. Lastly, we tackle generation-based dialogue learning with two proposed models, the memory-to-sequence (Mem2Seq) and global-to-local memory pointer network (GLMP). Mem2Seq is the first model to combine multi-hop memory attention with the idea of the copy mechanism. GLMP further introduces the concept of response sketching and double pointers copying. We show that GLMP achieves the state-of-the-art performance on human evaluation.

**DivGraphPointer: A Graph Pointer Network for Extracting Diverse Keyphrases**

Keyphrase extraction from documents is useful to a variety of applications such as information retrieval and document summarization. This paper presents an end-to-end method called DivGraphPointer for extracting a set of diversified keyphrases from a document. DivGraphPointer combines the advantages of traditional graph-based ranking methods and recent neural network-based approaches. Specifically, given a document, a word graph is constructed from the document based on word proximity and is encoded with graph convolutional networks, which effectively capture document-level word salience by modeling long-range dependency between words in the document and aggregating multiple appearances of identical words into one node. Furthermore, we propose a diversified point network to generate a set of diverse keyphrases out of the word graph in the decoding process. Experimental results on five benchmark data sets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

**Structured Summarization of Academic Publications**

We propose SUSIE, a novel summarization method that can work with state-of-the-art summarization models in order to produce structured scientific summaries for academic articles. We also created PMC-SA, a new dataset of academic publications, suitable for the task of structured summarization with neural networks. We apply SUSIE combined with three different summarization models on the new PMC-SA dataset and we show that the proposed method improves the performance of all models by as much as 4 ROUGE points.

**Explaining Machine Learning Classifiers through Diverse Counterfactual Explanations**

Post-hoc explanations of machine learning models are crucial for people to understand and act on algorithmic predictions. An intriguing class of explanations is through counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction. We posit that effective counterfactual explanations should satisfy two properties: feasibility of the counterfactual actions given user context and constraints, and diversity among the counterfactuals presented. To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on average distance and determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on three real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries.

**An Objective Evaluation Metric for image fusion based on Del Operator**

In this paper, a novel objective evaluation metric for image fusion is presented. Remarkable and attractive points of the proposed metric are that it has no parameter, the result is probability in the range of [0, 1] and it is free from illumination dependence. This metric is easy to implement and the result is computed in four steps: (1) Smoothing the images using Gaussian filter. (2) Transforming images to a vector field using Del operator. (3) Computing the normal distribution function ({\mu},{\sigma}) for each corresponding pixel, and converting to the standard normal distribution function. (4) Computing the probability of being well-behaved fusion method as the result. To judge the quality of the proposed metric, it is compared to thirteen well-known non-reference objective evaluation metrics, where eight fusion methods are employed on seven experiments of multimodal medical images. The experimental results and statistical comparisons show that in contrast to the previously objective evaluation metrics the proposed one performs better in terms of both agreeing with human visual perception and evaluating fusion methods that are not performed at the same level.

**Earlier Attention? Aspect-Aware LSTM for Aspect Sentiment Analysis**

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict fine-grained sentiments of comments with respect to given aspect terms or categories. In previous ABSA methods, the importance of aspect has been realized and verified. Most existing LSTM-based models take aspect into account via the attention mechanism, where the attention weights are calculated after the context is modeled in the form of contextual vectors. However, aspect-related information may be already discarded and aspect-irrelevant information may be retained in classic LSTM cells in the context modeling process, which can be improved to generate more effective context representations. This paper proposes a novel variant of LSTM, termed as aspect-aware LSTM (AA-LSTM), which incorporates aspect information into LSTM cells in the context modeling stage before the attention mechanism. Therefore, our AA-LSTM can dynamically produce aspect-aware contextual representations. We experiment with several representative LSTM-based models by replacing the classic LSTM cells with the AA-LSTM cells. Experimental results on SemEval-2014 Datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AA-LSTM.

**Butterfly: Robust One-step Approach towards Wildly-unsupervised Domain Adaptation**

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) trains with clean labeled data in source domain and unlabeled data in target domain to classify target-domain data. However, in real-world scenarios, it is hard to acquire fully-clean labeled data in source domain due to the expensive labeling cost. This brings us a new but practical adaptation called wildly-unsupervised domain adaptation (WUDA), which aims to transfer knowledge from noisy labeled data in source domain to unlabeled data in target domain. To tackle the WUDA, we present a robust one-step approach called Butterfly, which trains four networks. Specifically, two networks are jointly trained on noisy labeled data in source domain and pseudo-labeled data in target domain (i.e., data in mixture domain). Meanwhile, the other two networks are trained on pseudo-labeled data in target domain. By using dual-checking principle, Butterfly can obtain high-quality target-specific representations. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that Butterfly significantly outperforms other baselines on simulated and real-world WUDA tasks in most cases.

**Reinforcement Learning for Learning of Dynamical Systems in Uncertain Environment: a Tutorial**

In this paper, a review of model-free reinforcement learning for learning of dynamical systems in uncertain environments has discussed. For this purpose, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) will be reviewed. Furthermore, some learning algorithms such as Temporal Difference (TD) learning, Q-Learning, and Approximate Q-learning as model-free algorithms which constitute the main part of this article have been investigated, and benefits and drawbacks of each algorithm will be discussed. The discussed concepts in each section are explaining with details and examples.
