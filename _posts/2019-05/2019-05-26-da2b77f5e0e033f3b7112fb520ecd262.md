“Most of the organisations work in silos on their data and in absence of effective communication channel between Datawarehouse and Analytics team the whole effort of effective analysis goes awry. 80% organisations divide the effort of Datawarehouse, Advance analytics & Statistical analysis into different teams and these teams not only address the different business problems but they also aligned with different architects. In my opinion this could be the main reason that kills the flavor of Data Science. Interestingly during one of my assignments in the field of retail data analysis, I observed that they had developed their datawarehouse team only at the maturity level of summarization and aggregation. I realized that this datawarehouse or Data store world would end after delivering bunch of reports and some dashboards. Eventually, they would be more interested in archiving the data thereafter. That’s the Bottleneck !” datumengineering
