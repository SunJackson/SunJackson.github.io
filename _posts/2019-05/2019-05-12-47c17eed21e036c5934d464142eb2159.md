### Independent Hazards

Most of this comes from Kalbfleisch (1978), with an excellent technical outline by Ibrahim (2001).

Recall that the cumulative baseline hazard \(H_0(t) = \int_0^t \lambda_0(t) dt\) where the integral is the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. The central idea is to develop a prior for the cumulative hazard \(H_0(t)\), which will then admit a prior for the hazard, \(\lambda_0(t)\).

The Gamma Process is such a prior. Each realization of a Gamma Process is a cumulative hazard function that is centered around some prior cumulative hazard function, \(H^*\), with a sort of dispersion/concentration parameter, \(\beta\) that controls how tightly the realizations are distributed around the prior \(H^*\).

Okay, now the math. Let \(\mathcal{G}(\alpha, \beta)\) denote the Gamma distribution with shape parameter \(\alpha\) and rate parameter \(\beta\). Let \(H^*(t)\) for \(t\geq 0\) be our prior cumulative hazard function. For example we could choose \(H^*\) to be the exponential cumulative hazard, \(H^*(t)= \eta\cdot t\), where \(\eta\) is a fixed hyperparameter. By definition \(H^*(0)=0\). The Gamma Process is defined as having the following properties:

- \(H_0(0) = 0\)

- \(\lambda_0(t) = H_0(t) – H_0(s) \sim \mathcal G \Big(\ \beta\big(H^*(t) – H^*(s)\big)\ , \ \beta \ \Big)\), for \(t>s\)


The increments in the cumulative hazard is the hazard function. The gamma process has the property that these increments are independent and Gamma-distributed. For a set of time increments \(t\geq0\), we can use the properties above to generate one realization of hazards \(\{\lambda_0(t) \}_{t\geq0}\). Equivaltently, one realization of the cumulative hazard function is \(\{H_0(t)\}_{t\geq0}\), where \(H_0(t) = \sum_{k=0}^t \lambda_0(k)\). We denote the Gamma Process just described as \[H_0(t) \sim \mathcal{GP}\Big(\ \beta H^*(t), \ \beta \Big), \ \ t\geq0\]

Below in Panel A are some prior realizations of \(H_0(t)\) with a Weibull \(H^*\) prior for various concentration parameters, \(\beta\). Notice for low \(\beta\) the realizations are widely dispersed around the mean cumulative hazard. Higher \(\beta\) yields to tighter dispersion around \(H^*\).

Since there’s a correspondence between the \(H_0(t)\), \(\lambda_0(t)\), and \(S_0(t)\), we could also plot prior realizations of the baseline survival function \(S_0(t) = \exp\big\{- H_0(t) \big\}\) using the realization \(\{H_0(t)\}_{t\geq0}\). This is shown in Panel B with the Weibull survival function \(S^*\) corresponding to \(H^*\).
