How to build a CLI for R, with npm.

## Background

This blog post was triggered by a discussion on Twitter with MartinSkarzynski,who was looking for a way to build a CLI that launches an RScript.Here’s a way to do this using `npm`.

Please note that this blog post won’t teach you how to build the commandline tool, it will quickly go over the way to create a system-widecommand line interface, using npm.

If you want to learn more about building the utility, see thisfantastic series of blogpostsby Mark Sellor.

Now, the idea is to have a CLI, i.e. a way to launch your utility with:

And that, system-wide.

## What you’ll need

- An R script (script.R) with in it, for example:




```
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript --vanilla
cli::cat_rule("yeay")
cli::cat_bullet(Sys.time())

```

- `npm`, which you can get fromthere.


## Let’s go

Create a new folder, and go inside it.

Create the R Script there.

```
echo '#!/usr/bin/env Rscript --vanilla' > script.R
echo 'cli::cat_rule("yeay")' >> script.R
echo 'cli::cat_bullet(Sys.time())' >> script.R

```

Try your script to see if it works:

Now launch an npm project:

(You can also run it without the `-y` to interactively add informationto the `package.json`.)

Now the important part: add a `"bin"` value in the `package.json`, withthe name of the bin you want to create, and the path to the script,relatively to the package file. Here is an example of a `package.json`(I removed some elements).

```
{
 "name": "cli",
 "version": "1.0.0",
 "description": "CLI example with npm",
 "bin" : {
 "clir" : "./script.R"
 },
 "author": "Colin Fay",
 "license": "MIT"
}

```

Install it globally (need sudo rights):

And, voilà! Open your terminal, and you’re done!

```
