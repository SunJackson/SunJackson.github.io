The riddle of the week is rather standard probability calculus

> 
*If N points are generated at random places on the perimeter of a circle, what is the probability that you can pick a diameter such that all of those points are on only one side of the newly halved circle?*


Since it is equivalent to finding the range of N Uniform variates less than ½. And since the range of N Uniform variates is distributed as a Be(N-1,2) random variate. The resulting probability, which happens to be exactly ![](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2%5E%7BN-1%7D&bg=000000&%23038;fg=B0B0B0&%23038;s=0)

, is decreasing exponentially, as shown below…![](https://xianblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/temp-1.jpg?w=380&resize=380%2C380#038;h=380)
