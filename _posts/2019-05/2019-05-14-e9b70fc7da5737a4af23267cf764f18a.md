Steps Needed in a Process to Detect Anomalies And Have a Maintenance Notice Before We Have Scrap Created on The Production Line.

Describing my previous articles( 1, 2 ) process flow:

- **Get Training Data.**


- At least 2 weeks of **passed units** measurements.


- **Data Cleaning.**


- Ensure no null values.

- At least 95% data must have measurement values.


- **Anomalies Detection Model Creation.**


- Deep Learning Autoencoders.


- Isolation Forest.


- **Set Yield Threshold Desired, Normally 99%**


- **Get Prediction Value Limit by Linking Yield Threshold to Training Data Using The Anomaly Detection Model Created.**


- **Get Testing Data.**


- Last 24 Hour Data From Station Measurements, **Passed And Failed **Units.


- **Testing Data Cleaning.**



- **Get Anomalies From Testing Data by Using The Model Created And Prediction Limit Found Before.**


- **If Anomalies Found, Notify Maintenance to Avoid Scrap.**


- **Display Chart Showing Last 24 Hour Anomalies And Failures Found:**

As you can see( **Anomalies in blue**, **Failures in orange** ), we are detecting anomalies( Units close to measurement limits ) before failures.


Sending an alert when the first or second anomaly was detected will prevent scrap because the station will get maintenance to avoid failures.
