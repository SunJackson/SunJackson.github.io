-  From 4.00 to 5.00: Best practices for using RStudio products in production.


Following these “technical” workshops, we’re happy to welcome you for a cocktail reception.

In this second part of the evening, we’ll be talking about real-life applications of R in production: scaling scripts and Shiny applications, coding for durability, maintaining…

The doors will open at 13h30 for the workshops. You can also join us at 17h30 for the cocktail and use-cases.
