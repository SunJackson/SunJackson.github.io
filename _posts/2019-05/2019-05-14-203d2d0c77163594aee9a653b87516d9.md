Every time there is a new major update from The RFoundation (like the recent 3.6.0release in April). I’m always happy to seethe continuing progress and the combination of new features and bugfixes, but I also dread the upgrade because it means I have to addressthe issue of what to do about the burgeoning number of packages(libraries) I have installed.

Up until now I confess I simply have sort of “winged it”, done theupgrade and either manually thought about what packages I **“really”**needed or just grabbed a few essentials and then let my needs dictatewhatever else I reloaded. This time I decided to get serious about theprocess and pay attention to not only what I was doing but documentingit and keeping a record via some amount of coding (and this post).

I’m aware that there are full-fledged packagemanagers like`packrat` and `checkpoint` and even a package designed to manage theupgrade for you on windows, but I’m a Mac user and wanted to do thingsmy own way and I don’t need that level of sophistication.

So I set out to do the following:

1. Capture a list of everything I had installed under `R 3.5.3` and,very importantly, as much as I could about where I got the packagee.g.  `CRAN` or `GitHub` or ???

1. Keep a copy for my own edification and potential future use.

1. Do a clean `R 3.6.0` install and not copy any library directoriesmanually.

1. Take a look at the list I produced in #1 above but mainly to justdownload and install the exact same packages if I can find them.

1. Make the process mainly scripted and automatic and available againfor the future.


### Helpful background

As I was searching the web I found a few helpful posts that saved metime in building my own solution. The primary was thisposton `Stack Overflow`. I wanted to extend the function listed there to doa little more of my work for me. Instead of just being able to generatea listing of what I had installed from GitHub I wanted to be able todetermine most of the places I get packages from, which are `CRAN`,`GitHub` and `R-Forge`.

So let’s load `tidyverse` to have access to all it’s various functionsand features and then build a dataframe called `allmypackages` with thebasic information about the packages I currently have installed in R3.5.3.

**Note – I’m writing this after already upgrading so there will be a fewinconsistencies in the output**

- This could just as easily be a `tibble` but I chose `as.data.frame`

- I am deliberately removing base packages from the dataframe by`filter`

- I am eliminating columns I really don’t care about with `select`




```
require(tidyverse)
allmypackages <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
allmypackages <- allmypackages %>%
 filter(Priority != "base" | is.na(Priority)) %>%
 select(-c(Enhances:MD5sum, LinkingTo:Suggests)) %>%
 droplevels()
str(allmypackages)

```

```
## 'data.frame': 533 obs. of 8 variables:
## $ Package : Factor w/ 533 levels "abind","acepack",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
## $ LibPath : Factor w/ 1 level "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
## $ Version : Factor w/ 361 levels "0.0-8","0.0.1",..: 223 227 57 18 202 352 179 165 49 177 ...
## $ Priority : Factor w/ 1 level "recommended": NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
## $ Depends : Factor w/ 194 levels "base, stats, R (>= 3.3.0)",..: 25 NA 131 167 NA 145 132 NA NA 97 ...
## $ Imports : Factor w/ 356 levels "abind, coda, graphics, grDevices, methods, nlme, utils",..: 234 NA 250 75 323 242 1 324 328 336 ...
## $ NeedsCompilation: Factor w/ 2 levels "no","yes": 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 ...
## $ Built : Factor w/ 1 level "3.6.0": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

```

### A function to do the hard work

As I mentioned above the stack overflow post was a good start but Iwanted more information from the function. Rather than TRUE/FALSE to isit github I would like as much information as possible about where I gotthe package. The `package~source` function will be applied to the`Package` column for each row of our dataframe. For example`as.character(packageDescription("ggplot2")$Repository)` will get back“CRAN”, and `as.character(packageDescription("CHAID")$Repository)`will yield “R-Forge”. For GitHub packages the result is `character(0)`which has a `length` of zero. So we’ll test with an `if else` clause. Ifwe get an answer like “CRAN” we’ll just `return` it. If not, we’ll seeif there is a GitHub repo listed with`as.character(packageDescription(pkg)$GithubRepo)` as well as a GitHubusername `as.character(packageDescription(pkg)$GithubUsername)`. If theyexist we’ll concatenate and return. If not we’ll return “Other”. Besidesbeing good defensive programming this may catch the package you havebuilt for yourself as is the case for me.

```
package_source <- function(pkg){
 x <- as.character(packageDescription(pkg)$Repository)
 if (length(x)==0) {
 y <- as.character(packageDescription(pkg)$GithubRepo)
 z <- as.character(packageDescription(pkg)$GithubUsername)
 if (length(y)==0) {
 return("Other")
 } else {
 return(str_c("GitHub repo = ", z, "/", y))
 }
 } else {
 return(x)
 }
}
# show the first 60 as an example
head(sapply(allmypackages$Package, package_source), 60)

```

```
## [1] "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN" 
## [4] "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN" 
## [7] "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN" 
## [10] "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN" 
## [13] "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN"

```

### What’s in your libraries?

Now that we have the `package_source` function we can add a column toour data frame and do a little looking.

```
allmypackages$whereat <- sapply(allmypackages$Package, package_source)
str(allmypackages)

```

```
## 'data.frame': 533 obs. of 9 variables:
## $ Package : Factor w/ 533 levels "abind","acepack",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
## $ LibPath : Factor w/ 1 level "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
## $ Version : Factor w/ 361 levels "0.0-8","0.0.1",..: 223 227 57 18 202 352 179 165 49 177 ...
## $ Priority : Factor w/ 1 level "recommended": NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
## $ Depends : Factor w/ 194 levels "base, stats, R (>= 3.3.0)",..: 25 NA 131 167 NA 145 132 NA NA 97 ...
## $ Imports : Factor w/ 356 levels "abind, coda, graphics, grDevices, methods, nlme, utils",..: 234 NA 250 75 323 242 1 324 328 336 ...
## $ NeedsCompilation: Factor w/ 2 levels "no","yes": 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 ...
## $ Built : Factor w/ 1 level "3.6.0": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
## $ whereat : chr "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN" "CRAN" ...

```

```
table(allmypackages$whereat)

```

```
## 
## CRAN GitHub repo = cjtexas/colourgen 
## 526 1 
## GitHub repo = duncantl/RWordPress GitHub repo = duncantl/XMLRPC 
## GitHub repo = leeper/slopegraph GitHub repo = lorenzwalthert/stylermd 
## 1 1 
## Other R-Forge 
## 1 1

```

```
allmypackages %>% 
 filter(whereat == "Other") %>%
 select(Package, Version)

```

```
## Package Version
## 1 CGPfunctions 0.5.3

```

And just to be on the safe side we’ll also write a copy out as a csvfile so we have it around in case we ever need to refer back.

```
write.csv(allmypackages, "mypackagelistMay2019.csv")

```

### Go ahead and install R 3.6.0

At this point we have what we need, so go ahead and download and installR 3.6.0. At the end of the installation process you’ll have a pristinecopy with a new library directory. When next you restart R and R Studioyou’ll see a clean new version. Let’s make use of our data frame toautomate most of the process of getting nice clean copies of thelibraries we want.

We’ll start by getting the entire `tidyverse` since we need severalparts and because installing it will trigger the installation of quite afew dependencies and bootstrap our work.

```
# post upgrade with output surpessed
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

```

Now we have R 3.6.0 and some additional packages. Let’s see what we cando. First let’s create two dataframes, one with our old list and onewith what we have right now. Then we can use `anti_join` to make adataframe that lists the differences `thediff`. We can use `filter` and`pull` to generate a vector of just the the packages that are on CRAN wewant to install.

**Note – I’m faking the output rather than reinstalling all thesepackages on my machine so you will see packages from the `tidyverse` inthe listing **

```
oldpackages <- read.csv("mypackagelistMay2019.csv")
allmypackages <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
allmypackages <- allmypackages %>%
 filter(Priority != "base" | is.na(Priority)) %>%
 select(-c(Enhances:MD5sum, LinkingTo:Suggests))
thediff <- anti_join(oldpackages,allmypackages, by = "Package")

```

```
## Warning: Column `Package` joining factors with different levels, coercing to character vector

```

```
thediff <- droplevels(thediff)
thediff %>%
 filter(whereat == "CRAN") %>%
 pull(Package) %>%
 as.character 

```

```
## [1] "abind" "acepack" "afex" "alphavantager" "antiword" "ape" 
## [7] "arm" "askpass" "assertthat" "backports" "base64enc" "BayesFactor" 
## [13] "bayesplot" "bayestestR" "BDgraph" "beeswarm" "BH" "bibtex" 
## [19] "bigmemory" "bigmemory.sri" "bindr" "bindrcpp" "bitops" "blavaan" 
## [25] "bookdown" "Boom" "BoomSpikeSlab" "boot" "brew" "broom" 
## [31] "broom.mixed" "broomExtra" "BSDA" "bsts" "BWStest" "ca" 
## [37] "Cairo" "callr" "car" "carData" "caret" "caTools" 
## [43] "cdata" "cellranger" "checkmate" "class" "classInt" "cli" 
## [49] "clipr" "clisymbols" "cluster" "coda" "codetools" "coin" 
## [55] "colormap" "colorspace" "colourpicker" "combinat" "commonmark" "CompQuadForm"

```

### Just do it!

Now that you have a nice automated list of everything that is a CRANpackage you can give it a final look and see if there is anything elseyou’d like to filter out. Once you are sure the list is right one finalpipe will set the process in motion.

```
thediff %>%
 filter(whereat == "CRAN") %>%
 pull(Package) %>%
 as.character %>%
 install.packages

```

Depending on the speed of your network connection and the number ofpackages you have that will run for a few minutes.

That takes care of our CRAN packages. What about GitHub?

```
thediff %>%
 filter(str_detect(whereat, "GitHub repo")) %>%
 select(Package, Version, NeedsCompilation, whereat)

```

```
## Package Version NeedsCompilation whereat
## 1 colourgen 0.2.0 no GitHub repo = cjtexas/colourgen
## 2 RWordPress 0.2-3 no GitHub repo = duncantl/RWordPress
## 3 slopegraph 0.1.14 no GitHub repo = leeper/slopegraph
## 4 stylermd 0.1.0.9000 no GitHub repo = lorenzwalthert/stylermd
## 5 XMLRPC 0.3-1 no GitHub repo = duncantl/XMLRPC

```

Here’s another chance to review what you have and whether you still wantneed these packages. I could automate the process and once again feedthe right vector to `devtools::install_github()` but instead I choose tohandle these manually as in`devtools::install_github("leeper/slopegraph")`.

Same with the one package I get from R-Forge…

```
allmypackages %>%
 filter(str_detect(whereat, "R-Forge")) %>%
 select(Package, Version, NeedsCompilation, whereat)
install.packages("CHAID", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

```

At the end of this process you should have a nice clean R install thathas all the packages you choose to maintain as well as a detailedlisting of what those are.

### Done!

I hope you’ve found this useful. I am always open to comments,corrections and suggestions.
