Today I’ve removed my system’s R package and installed MRO instead. While re-installing all packages,I’ve encountered one of the most frustrating error message for someone installing packages fromsource:

```
Error : /tmp/Rtmpw60aCp/R.INSTALL7819efef27e/xml2/man/read_xml.Rd:47: unable to load shared object
'/usr/lib64/R/library/xml2/libs/xml2.so': 
libicui18n.so.58: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory ERROR: 
installing Rd objects failed for package ‘xml2’ 
```

This library, `libicui18n.so.58` is a pain in the butt. However, you can easily install it if youinstall miniconda. After installing miniconda, you can look for it with:

```
[19-05-18 18:26] cbrunos in ~/ ➤ locate libicui18n.so.58

/home/cbrunos/miniconda3/lib/libicui18n.so.58
/home/cbrunos/miniconda3/lib/libicui18n.so.58.2
/home/cbrunos/miniconda3/pkgs/icu-58.2-h9c2bf20_1/lib/libicui18n.so.58
/home/cbrunos/miniconda3/pkgs/icu-58.2-h9c2bf20_1/lib/libicui18n.so.58.2

```

So now you need to tell R where to look for this library. Thefollowing Stackoverflow answer saved the day. Add the followinglines to `R_HOME/etc/ldpaths` (in my case, it was in `/opt/microsoft/ropen/3.5.2/lib64/R/etc/`):

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/username/miniconda3/lib/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

and try to install `xml2` again, and it should work! If not, just abandon the idea of using R andswitch to doing data science with VBA, it’ll be less frustrating.

Something else, if you install Microsoft R Open, you’ll be stuck with some older packages, becauseby default MRO uses a snapshot of CRAN from a given day as a mirror. To get the freshest packages,add the following line to your `.Rprofile` file (which should be located in your `HOME`):

```
options(repos = c(CRAN = "http://cran.rstudio.com/"))
```

And to finish this short blog post, add the following line to your `.Rprofile`if you get the following error messages when trying to install a package from github:

```
remotes::install_github('rstudio/DT') Downloading GitHub repo rstudio/[email protected] tar:

status 1 tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now tar: This does not look like a tar archive

```

The solution, which can found here

```
options("download.file.method" = "libcurl")
```
