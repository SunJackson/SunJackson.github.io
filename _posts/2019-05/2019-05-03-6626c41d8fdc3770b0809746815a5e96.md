It's taken a little bit longer than usual, but Microsoft R Open 3.5.2 (MRO) is now available for download for Windows and Linux. This update is based on R 3.5.2, and accordingly fixes a few minor bugs compared to MRO 3.5.1. The main change you will note is that new CRAN packages released since R 3.5.1 can now be used with this version of MRO.

Microsoft R Open 3.5.3, based on R 3.5.3, will be available next week, on May 10. Microsoft R Open 3.6.0, based on the recently-released R 3.6.0, is currently under development, and we'll make an announcement here when it's available too.

One thing to note: as of version 3.5.2 Microsoft R Open is no longer distributed for MacOS systems. If you want to continue to take advantage of the Accelerate framework on MacOS for, it's not too difficult to tweak the CRAN binary for MacOS to enable multi-threaded computing, and the additional open source bundled packages (like checkpoint and iterators) are available to install from CRAN or GitHub. 

As always, we hope you find Microsoft R Open useful, and if you have any comments or questions please visit the Microsoft R Open forum. You can follow the development of Microsoft R Open at the MRO Github repository. To download Microsoft R Open, simply follow the link below.
