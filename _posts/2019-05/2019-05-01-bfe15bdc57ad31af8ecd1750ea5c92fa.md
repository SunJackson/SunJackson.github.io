“A **chatbot** (also known as a **talkbot**, **chatterbot**, **Bot**, **IM bot**, **interactive agent**, or **Artificial Conversational Entity**) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.”

Chatbots are not very new, one of the foremost of this kind is ELIZA, which was created in the early 1960s and is worth exploring. In order to successfully build a conversational engine, it should take care of the following things:

1. Understand who is the target audience

1. Understand the Natural Language of the communication.

1. Understand the intent or desire of the user

1. provide responses that can answer the user


Today we will learn to create a simple chat assistant or chatbot using Python’s NLTK library.

NLTK has a module, nltk.chat, which simplifies building these engines by providing a generic framework.

In this blog I am using 2 imports from nltk.chat.util:

**Chat**: This is a class that has all the logic that is used by the chatbot.

**Reflections**: This is a dictionary that contains a set of input values and its corresponding output values. It is an optional dictionary that you can use. You can also create your own dictionary in the same format as below and use it in your code. If you check nltk.chat.util, you will see its values as below:



You can also create your own reflections dictionary in the same format as above and use it in your code. Here is an example for this:

and use it as :



Using above concept from python’s NLTK library, lets build a simple chatbot without using any of the Machine Learning or Deep Learning Algorithms. So obviously our chatbot will be a decent one but not an intelligent one.

Source Code :



The code is quite simple, still lets understand it.

Once the function chatty() is invoked, a default message will be displayed:

Next I’ve created an instance of Chat class containing **pairs**(list of tuples containing set of question and answers) and **reflections**(discussed above).

Next step is to trigger the conversation:

a simple conversation with Chatty



As you can see we have just hardcoded the probable question and answers in the list pairs.

Lets interact more with Chatty :

The nltk.chat chatbots work on the regex of keywords present in your question. So you can add any number of questions in a proper format so that your chatbot doesn’t get confused in determining the regex.

In this blog I have explained in simple steps as to how you can build your own chatbot using NLTK and of course its not an intelligent one.

I hope you guys have enjoyed reading.

Happy Learning !!!
