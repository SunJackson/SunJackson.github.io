“One of the most critical aspects of data science is the support of data-analytic thinking. Skill at thinking data-analytically is important not just for the data scientist but throughout the organization. For example, managers and line employees in other functional areas will only get the best from the company’s data-science resources if they have some basic understanding of the fundamental principles.” Foster Provost & Tom Fawcett ( 2014 )
