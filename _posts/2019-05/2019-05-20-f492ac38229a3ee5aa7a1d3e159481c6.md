Overnight, digest version 0.6.19 arrived on CRAN. It will get uploaded to Debian in due course.

digest creates hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the `md5`, `sha-1`, `sha-256`, `sha-512`, `crc32`, `xxhash32`, `xxhash64`, `murmur32`, and `spookyhash` algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects.

This version contains two new functions adding new digest functionality. First, Dmitriy Selivanov added a fast and vectorized `digest2int` to convert (arbitrary) strings into 32 bit integers using one-at-a-time hashing. Second, Kendon Bell, over a series of PRs, put together a nice implementation of spookyhash as a first streaming hash algorithm in digest. So big thanks to both Dmitriy and Kendon.

No other changes were made.

CRANberries provides the usual summary of changes to the previous version.
