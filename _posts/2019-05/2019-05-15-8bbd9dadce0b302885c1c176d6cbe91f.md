**Apply here**.

**Be inspired, every day**
**Take your career in exciting and rewarding directions at one of the world’s top 80 universities**

Everyone needs a platform to launch a satisfying career. At Monash, we give you the space and support to take your career in all kinds of exciting new directions with access to quality research, infrastructure and learning facilities. We’re a university full of energetic and enthusiastic minds, driven to challenge what’s expected, expand what we know, and learn from other inspiring, empowering thinkers. Innovative, supportive, successful and with great breadth and depth of talent, Monash Information Technology is a leader in research and education. We provide an ideal environment in which to excel and are located in Melbourne, one of the world’s most liveable cities.

**The Opportunity**

The Optimisation research group in the Faculty of Information Technology is a world leading research group in discrete optimisation. Together with partners at the University of Melbourne and Data61, it has created and continues to develop MiniZinc, the leading modelling language for constraint programming; and lazy clause generation CP solving, which provides the state of the art CP solving technology.

We invite outstanding academics to join our world-class team to deliver high-quality teaching and research that will help shape the future of optimisation for energy, transport, health and many other application domains. Positions are available at a Level B Lecturer or Level C Senior Lecturer level (equivalent to Assistant Professor and Associate Professor in North America) for academics with strong skills in the development and application of techniques to any of the following areas of expertise in discrete optimisation research:

Constraint Programming
Mixed Integer Programming
SAT and SAT-modulo theories
Combinatorial search
Modelling languages and program analysis

Expertise in the application of optimisation to large-scale problem instances containing combinations of discrete choices and non-linear constraints (of key importance in emerging research for renewable energy systems operation and planning, transport and health), would be ideal. The successful candidate will join a rapidly expanding multidisciplinary group in the above areas, and be supervised by Prof Peter Stuckey, an international expert in discrete optimisation and programming languages.

The successful candidate will be an energetic and innovative academic, who has strong methodological skills and the ability to pioneer in emerging research areas. You will have a PhD in computer science, engineering, information sciences, cognitive or linguistic sciences, or a related field, along with post-PhD research or work experience. All candidates must have a strong publication record in top conferences and journals and teaching/mentoring experience. Evidence of grants and industry partnerships is preferred.

**The Melbourne Area**

For six consecutive years, Melbourne has been rated the #1 city worldwide for quality of life (see Economist & Guardian), with excellent education, healthcare, infrastructure, low crime, and exceptional cuisine, cultural activities, and creative design. The regional area is renowned for its dramatic coastline, extensive parks, exotic wildlife, and the Yarra Valley wine region.

This is a unique opportunity to join a leading “Group of 8” University with top-rankings and like-minded, passionate academics. If you feel you have the drive and expertise to contribute to this cutting-edge group, then we encourage you to apply!

To Apply:

Required application materials include:

Cover letter (indicating application area of expertise and planned research for the future)
Current CV with publication list, and research and teaching interests
Three-five references with email/phone contacts
Three representative publications

For instructions on how to apply, please refer to "How to apply for Monash jobs".

The Faculty is strongly committed to improving the diversity of our staff and students, and promoting a culture of equity, fairness, respect and openness. We fully support the gender equity principles of the Athena SWAN Charter.

At Monash University, we are committed to being a Child Safe organisation. This position at the University will require the incumbent to hold a valid Working with Children Check.
