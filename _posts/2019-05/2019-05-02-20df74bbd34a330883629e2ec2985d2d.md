**By Susan Li, Sr. Data Scientist**

We would like to model the price of a house, we know that the price depends on the location of the house, square footage of a house, year built, year renovated, number of bedrooms, number of garages, etc. So those factors contribute to the pattern — premium location would typically lead to a higher price. However, all houses within the same area and have same square footage do not have the exact same price. The variation in price is the noise. Our goal in price modeling is to model the pattern and ignore the noise. The same concepts apply to modeling hotel room prices too.

Therefore, to start, we are going to implement regularization techniques for linear regression of house pricing data.

 

### The Data

 There is an excellent house prices data set can be found here.

The good news is that we have many features to play with (81), the bad news is that 19 features have missing values, and 4 of them have over 80% missing values. For any feature, if it is missing 80% of values, it can’t be that important, therefore, I decided to remove these 4 features.



 

### Explore Features

 **Target feature distribution**

Figure 3


 

The target feature - SalePrice is right skewed. As linear models like normally distributed data , we will transform SalePrice and make it more normally distributed.

Figure 5


 

There exists strong correlations between some of the features. For example, GarageYrBlt and YearBuilt, TotRmsAbvGrd and GrLivArea, GarageArea and GarageCars are strongly correlated. They actually express more or less the same thing. I will let ***ElasticNetCV*** to help reduce redundancy later.

Figure 6


 

The correlation of SalePrice with OverallQual is the greatest (around 0.8). Also GrLivArea presents a correlation of over 0.7, and GarageCars presents a correlation of over 0.6. Let’s look at these 4 features in more detail.

### **ElasticNet**

 

**Ridge** and **Lasso** regression are regularized linear regression models.
**ElasticNe**t is essentially a **Lasso/Ridge** hybrid, that entails the minimization of an objective function that includes both **L1** (Lasso) and **L2**(Ridge) norms.
**ElasticNet** is useful when there are multiple features which are correlated with one another.
The class **ElasticNetCV** can be used to set the parameters `alpha` (α) and `l1_ratio` (ρ) by cross-validation.
**ElasticNetCV**: **ElasticNet**model with best model selection by cross-validation.

Let’s see what **ElasticNetCV** is going to select for us.

ElasticNetCV.py

Figure 8

0< The optimal l1_ratio <1 , indicating the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2, that is, the combination of **Lasso** and **Ridge**.

**Model Evaluation**

The **RMSE** here is actually **RMSLE** ( Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error). Because we have taken the log of the actual values. Here is a nice write up explaining the differences between RMSE and RMSLE.

**Feature Importance**

Figure 10


 

A reduction of 58.91% features looks productive. The top 4 most important features selected by ElasticNetCV are **Condition2_PosN**, **MSZoning_C(all)**, **Exterior1st_BrkComm** & **GrLivArea**. We are going to see how these features compare with those selected by Xgboost.

 

### Xgboost

 The first Xgboost model, we start from default parameters.

xgb_model1.py

Figure 11


 

It is already way better an the model selected by ElasticNetCV!

The second Xgboost model, we gradually add a few parameters that suppose to add model’s accuracy.

xgb_model2.py
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VIBKUuid-10UXGelajkx4g.png)


Figure 12


 

There was again an improvement!

The third Xgboost model, we add a learning rate, hopefully it will yield a more accurate model.

xgb_model3.py

Figure 13


 

Unfortunately, there was no improvement. I concluded that xgb_model2 is the best model.

**Feature Importance**

Figure 14


 

The top 4 most important features selected by Xgboost are **LotArea**, **GrLivArea**, **OverallQual** & **TotalBsmtSF**.

There is only one feature **GrLivArea** was selected by both ElasticNetCV and Xgboost.

So now we are going to select some relevant features and fit the Xgboost again.

Another small improvement!
