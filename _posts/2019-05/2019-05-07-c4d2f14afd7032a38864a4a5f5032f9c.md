**Forget the Learning Rate, Decay Loss**

In the usual deep neural network optimization process, the learning rate is the most important hyper parameter, which greatly affects the final convergence effect. The purpose of learning rate is to control the stepsize and gradually reduce the impact of noise on the network. In this paper, we will use a fixed learning rate with method of decaying loss to control the magnitude of the update. We used Image classification, Semantic segmentation, and GANs to verify this method. Experiments show that the loss decay strategy can greatly improve the performance of the model

**Model Comparison for Semantic Grouping**

We introduce a probabilistic framework for quantifying the semantic similarity between two groups of embeddings. We formulate the task of semantic similarity as a model comparison task in which we contrast a generative model which jointly models two sentences versus one that does not. We illustrate how this framework can be used for the Semantic Textual Similarity tasks using clear assumptions about how the embeddings of words are generated. We apply model comparison that utilises information criteria to address some of the shortcomings of Bayesian model comparison, whilst still penalising model complexity. We achieve competitive results by applying the proposed framework with an appropriate choice of likelihood on the STS datasets.

**Coevo: a collaborative design platform with artificial agents**

We present Coevo, an online platform that allows both humans and artificial agents to design shapes that solve different tasks. Our goal is to explore common shared design tools that can be used by humans and artificial agents in a context of creation. This approach can provide a better knowledge transfer and interaction with artificial agents since a common language of design is defined. In this paper, we outline the main components of this platform and discuss the definition of a human-centered language to enhance human-AI collaboration in co-creation scenarios.

**The Level Weighted Structural Similarity Loss: A Step Away from the MSE**

The Mean Square Error (MSE) has shown its strength when applied in deep generative models such as Auto-Encoders to model reconstruction loss. However, in image domain especially, the limitation of MSE is obvious: it assumes pixel independence and ignores spatial relationships of samples. This contradicts most architectures of Auto-Encoders which use convolutional layers to extract spatial dependent features. We base on the structural similarity metric (SSIM) and propose a novel level weighted structural similarity (LWSSIM) loss for convolutional Auto-Encoders. Experiments on common datasets on various Auto-Encoder variants show that our loss is able to outperform the MSE loss and the Vanilla SSIM loss. We also provide reasons why our model is able to succeed in cases where the standard SSIM loss fails.

**Fault Diagnosis using Clustering. What Statistical Test to use for Hypothesis Testing?**

Predictive maintenance and condition-based monitoring systems have seen significant prominence in recent years to minimize the impact of machine downtime on production and its costs. Predictive maintenance involves using concepts of data mining, statistics, and machine learning to build models that are capable of performing early fault detection, diagnosing the faults and predicting the time to failure. Fault diagnosis has been one of the core areas where the actual failure mode of the machine is identified. In fluctuating environments such as manufacturing, clustering techniques have proved to be more reliable compared to supervised learning methods. One of the fundamental challenges of clustering is developing a test hypothesis and choosing an appropriate statistical test for hypothesis testing. Most statistical analyses use some underlying assumptions of the data which most real-world data is incapable of satisfying those assumptions. This paper is dedicated to overcoming the following challenge by developing a test hypothesis for fault diagnosis application using clustering technique and performing PERMANOVA test for hypothesis testing.

**A Scale-Consistent Approach for Recommender Systems**

In this paper we propose and develop a relatively simple and efficient approach for estimating unknown elements of a user-rating matrix in the context of a recommender system (RS). The critical theoretical property of the method is its consistency with respect to arbitrary units implicitly adopted by different users to construct their quantitative ratings of products. It is argued that this property is needed for robust performance accuracy across a broad spectrum of RS application domains.

**Predicting How to Distribute Work Between Algorithms and Humans to Segment an Image Batch**

Foreground object segmentation is a critical step for many image analysis tasks. While automated methods can produce high-quality results, their failures disappoint users in need of practical solutions. We propose a resource allocation framework for predicting how best to allocate a fixed budget of human annotation effort in order to collect higher quality segmentations for a given batch of images and automated methods. The framework is based on a prediction module that estimates the quality of given algorithm-drawn segmentations. We demonstrate the value of the framework for two novel tasks related to predicting how to distribute annotation efforts between algorithms and humans. Specifically, we develop two systems that automatically decide, for a batch of images, when to recruit humans versus computers to create 1) coarse segmentations required to initialize segmentation tools and 2) final, fine-grained segmentations. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of relying on a mix of human and computer efforts over relying on either resource alone for segmenting objects in images coming from three diverse modalities (visible, phase contrast microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy).

**AdaNet: A Scalable and Flexible Framework for Automatically Learning Ensembles**

**Multi-resolution Networks For Flexible Irregular Time Series Modeling (Multi-FIT)**

Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients’ vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.

**ON-OFF Privacy with Correlated Requests**

We introduce the ON-OFF privacy problem. At each time, the user is interested in the latest message of one of N online sources chosen at random, and his privacy status can be ON or OFF for each request. Only when privacy is ON the user wants to hide the source he is interested in. The problem is to design ON-OFF privacy schemes with maximum download rate that allow the user to obtain privately his requested messages. In many realistic scenarios, the user’s requests are correlated since they depend on his personal attributes such as age, gender, political views, or geographical location. Hence, even when privacy is OFF, he cannot simply reveal his request since this will leak information about his requests when privacy was ON. We study the case when the users’s requests can be modeled by a Markov chain and N=2 sources. In this case, we propose an ON-OFF privacy scheme and prove its optimality.

**Dropping Pixels for Adversarial Robustness**

Deep neural networks are vulnerable against adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose to train and test the networks with randomly subsampled images with high drop rates. We show that this approach significantly improves robustness against adversarial examples in all cases of bounded L0, L2 and L_inf perturbations, while reducing the standard accuracy by a small value. We argue that subsampling pixels can be thought to provide a set of robust features for the input image and, thus, improves robustness without performing adversarial training.

**Nested Variational Autoencoder for Topic Modeling on Microtexts with Word Vectors**

Most of the information on the Internet is represented in the form of microtexts, which are short text snippets like news headlines or tweets. These source of information is abundant and mining this data could uncover meaningful insights. Topic modeling is one of the popular methods to extract knowledge from a collection of documents, nevertheless conventional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is unable to perform well on short documents, mostly due to the scarcity of word co-occurrence statistics embedded in the data. The objective of our research is to create a topic model which can achieve great performances on microtexts while requiring a small runtime for scalability to large datasets. To solve the lack of information of microtexts, we allow our method to take advantage of word embeddings for additional knowledge of relationships between words. For speed and scalability, we apply Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes, an algorithm that can perform efficient black-box inference in probabilistic models. The result of our work is a novel topic model called Nested Variational Autoencoder which is a distribution that takes into account word vectors and is parameterized by a neural network architecture. For optimization, the model is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the original LDA model. Experiments show the improvements of our model on microtexts as well as its runtime advantage.

**Context-Dependent Semantic Parsing over Temporally Structured Data**

We describe a new semantic parsing setting that allows users to query the system using both natural language questions and actions within a graphical user interface. Multiple time series belonging to an entity of interest are stored in a database and the user interacts with the system to obtain a better understanding of the entity’s state and behavior, entailing sequences of actions and questions whose answers may depend on previous factual or navigational interactions. We design an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture that models context dependency through copying mechanisms and multiple levels of attention over inputs and previous outputs. When trained to predict tokens using supervised learning, the proposed architecture substantially outperforms standard sequence generation baselines. Training the architecture using policy gradient leads to further improvements in performance, reaching a sequence-level accuracy of 88.7% on artificial data and 74.8% on real data.

**Scalable GWR: A linear-time algorithm for large-scale geographically weighted regression with polynomial kernels**

While a number of studies have developed fast geographically weighted regression (GWR) algorithms for large samples, none of them achieves the linear-time estimation that is considered requisite for big data analysis in machine learning, geostatistics, and related domains. Against this backdrop, this study proposes a scalable geographically weighted regression (ScaGWR) for large datasets. The key development is the calibration of the model through a pre-compression of the matrices and vectors whose size depends on the sample size, prior to the execution of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) that is the heaviest computational step in conventional GWR. This pre-compression allows us to run the proposed GWR extension such that its computation time increases linearly with sample size, whereas conventional GWR algorithms take at most quad-quadratic-order time. With this development, the ScaGWR can be calibrated with more than one million samples without parallelization. Moreover, the ScaGWR estimator can be regarded as an empirical Bayesian estimator that is more stable than the conventional GWR estimator. This study compared the ScaGWR with the conventional GWR in terms of estimation accuracy, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency using a Monte Carlo simulation. Then, we apply these methods to a residential land analysis in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The code for ScaGWR is available in the R package scgwr, and is going to be incorporated into another R package, GWmodel.

**ASER: A Large-scale Eventuality Knowledge Graph**

Understanding human’s language requires complex world knowledge. However, existing large-scale knowledge graphs mainly focus on knowledge about entities while ignoring knowledge about activities, states, or events, which are used to describe how entities or things act in the real world. To fill this gap, we develop ASER (activities, states, events, and their relations), a large-scale eventuality knowledge graph extracted from more than 11-billion-token unstructured textual data. ASER contains 15 relation types belonging to five categories, 194-million unique eventualities, and 64-million unique edges among them. Both human and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of ASER.

**AdaCos: Adaptively Scaling Cosine Logits for Effectively Learning Deep Face Representations**

The cosine-based softmax losses and their variants achieve great success in deep learning based face recognition. However, hyperparameter settings in these losses have significant influences on the optimization path as well as the final recognition performance. Manually tuning those hyperparameters heavily relies on user experience and requires many training tricks. In this paper, we investigate in depth the effects of two important hyperparameters of cosine-based softmax losses, the scale parameter and angular margin parameter, by analyzing how they modulate the predicted classification probability. Based on these analysis, we propose a novel cosine-based softmax loss, AdaCos, which is hyperparameter-free and leverages an adaptive scale parameter to automatically strengthen the training supervisions during the training process. We apply the proposed AdaCos loss to large-scale face verification and identification datasets, including LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C 1:1 Verification. Our results show that training deep neural networks with the AdaCos loss is stable and able to achieve high face recognition accuracy. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art softmax losses on all the three datasets.

**Introducing Graph Smoothness Loss for Training Deep Learning Architectures**

We introduce a novel loss function for training deep learning architectures to perform classification. It consists in minimizing the smoothness of label signals on similarity graphs built at the output of the architecture. Equivalently, it can be seen as maximizing the distances between the network function images of training inputs from distinct classes. As such, only distances between pairs of examples in distinct classes are taken into account in the process, and the training does not prevent inputs from the same class to be mapped to distant locations in the output domain. We show that this loss leads to similar performance in classification as architectures trained using the classical cross-entropy, while offering interesting degrees of freedom and properties. We also demonstrate the interest of the proposed loss to increase robustness of trained architectures to deviations of the inputs.

**Interpretable multiclass classification by MDL-based rule lists**

Interpretable classifiers have recently witnessed an increase in attention from the data mining community because they are inherently easier to understand and explain than their more complex counterparts. Examples of interpretable classification models include decision trees, rule sets, and rule lists. Learning such models often involves optimizing hyperparameters, which typically requires substantial amounts of data and may result in relatively large models. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning compact yet accurate probabilistic rule lists for multiclass classification. Specifically, we propose a novel formalization based on probabilistic rule lists and the minimum description length (MDL) principle. This results in virtually parameter-free model selection that naturally allows to trade-off model complexity with goodness of fit, by which overfitting and the need for hyperparameter tuning are effectively avoided. Finally, we introduce the Classy algorithm, which greedily finds rule lists according to the proposed criterion. We empirically demonstrate that Classy selects small probabilistic rule lists that outperform state-of-the-art classifiers when it comes to the combination of predictive performance and interpretability. We show that Classy is insensitive to its only parameter, i.e., the candidate set, and that compression on the training set correlates with classification performance, validating our MDL-based selection criterion.

**High-Performance Support Vector Machines and Its Applications**

The support vector machines (SVM) algorithm is a popular classification technique in data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a distributed SVM algorithm and demonstrate its use in a number of applications. The algorithm is named high-performance support vector machines (HPSVM). The major contribution of HPSVM is two-fold. First, HPSVM provides a new way to distribute computations to the machines in the cloud without shuffling the data. Second, HPSVM minimizes the inter-machine communications in order to maximize the performance. We apply HPSVM to some real-world classification problems and compare it with the state-of-the-art SVM technique implemented in R on several public data sets. HPSVM achieves similar or better results.

**Fast AutoAugment**

Data augmentation is an indispensable technique to improve generalization and also to deal with imbalanced datasets. Recently, AutoAugment has been proposed to automatically search augmentation policies from a dataset and has significantly improved performances on many image recognition tasks. However, its search method requires thousands of GPU hours to train even in a reduced setting. In this paper, we propose Fast AutoAugment algorithm that learns augmentation policies using a more efficient search strategy based on density matching. In comparison to AutoAugment, the proposed algorithm speeds up the search time by orders of magnitude while maintaining the comparable performances on the image recognition tasks with various models and datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.
