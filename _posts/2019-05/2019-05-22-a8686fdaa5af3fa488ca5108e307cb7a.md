(TL;DR: You can add vectors that have the same number of elements.)

Lasttime,we learnt about **scalar multiplication**. Let’s get to adding vectorstogether!

We will follow the notation in Goodfellow, Ian, etal.. If our vector has elements that are real numbers, then we can say thatis a **-dimensional** vector.

We can also say that lies in some set of **all vectorsthat have the same dimensions as itself**. This might be a bit abstract at first,but it’s not too bad at all.

Let’s define two vectors:


They have two elements. They are, therefore, two-dimensional vectors.

What are some other two dimensional vectors made up of real numbers? Wecould have:


There are **infinitely many** vectors with two elements that we could come upwith! How can we describe this infinite set of vectors made up of realnumbers? We can say that our two-dimensional vectors made up of realnumbers lie in this set:


What in the world does this mean?

## Cartesian products

To understand what the above product means, let’s use a simplifiedexample. Let’s define sets of integers like so:


What is the result of ? We can depict this operation in amatrix:


What we’re doing here is taking an arbitrary element from our first set,. We are then pairing it up with a second arbitrary element from theset, . The entries in the matrix form a set of **ordered pairs(i.e. the order of elements in the pair of numbers matter)** which canbe defined like so:


This is called the **Cartesian product** of two sets. Translating theequation into plain English gives us this:


Now let’s replace the terminology of **ordered pairs** with the word**vectors**. If we depict the vectors as row vectors, our matrix nowlooks like this:


Now let’s replace sets and with the set of real numbers,. The Cartesian product then becomes:


We now have a set of ordered pairs which are drawn from the **Cartesianproduct of the set of real numbers with itself!** If we again replacethe term **‘ordered pairs’** with **‘vectors’**, we now have the **setof all two dimensional, real number vectors**. We can finally say this about the vectors we defined earlier:


Hooray!

Now it’s not difficult to see that is the set formed bytaking the **-ary Cartesian product** of the set of real numbers. Wecan now quite easily generalise to vectors of dimensions.

## Get to the point! When can we add vectors?

If we have vectors of **equal dimensions**, we simply **add the elementsof the vectors, one element at a time!** The resulting vector is a vector ofthe **same dimensions as the vectors that were just added**.

Let’s use our example vectors from before:


We know that . We now know that. Let’s add them:


Easy!

Some operations on vectors are defined differently to those that aredefined in linear algebra.

When we have two `numeric` vectors with the same number of elements, wecan add them just like we saw above:

```
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(2, 3, 4)

x + y

```

But what if we try to add two `numeric` vectors with different numbersof elements?

```
x <- c(1, 2)
y <- c(1, 1, 1, 1)
x + y

```

What the hell just happened? This isn’t what we have just learnt! How is itpossible to add these two vectors given the mathematical definition ofvector addition?

If we look at the help page for `+`, we can find our answer:

> 
The binary operators return vectors containing the result of theelement by element operations. If involving a zero-length vector theresult has length zero. Otherwise, **the elements of shorter vectorsare recycled as necessary (with a warning when they are recycled onlyfractionally).**


This is what R is doing:

- For the first two elements of the **longer `vector`**, R is addingthe **shorter `vector`** to it in the above mathematically definedway.

- When it runs out of elements in the **shorter `vector`**, R goesback to the first element of the **shorter `vector`** and adds thisto the next element of the **longer `vector`**.

- R continues like this until it runs out of elements in the **longer`vector`**.


(Man, that’s a lot of use of the word `vector`!)

In this way, R allows you to add vectors of unequal length. We also toldthat some other operators also behave in this way:

> 
The operators are + for addition, – for subtraction, * formultiplication, / for division and ^ for exponentiation.


These aren’t our focus here so let’s move on.

In our standard mathematical definition, we can’t add scalars tovectors. But we can in R!

We simply add the scalar to our vector, one element at a time:

```
x <- 1
y <- c(1, 2, 3)

x + y

```

We learnt how to add vectors. We also learnt a little bit more aboutsets. We learnt that R can behave differently to our mathematicaldefinitions of vector addition. Let’s now move onto **dot products**!
