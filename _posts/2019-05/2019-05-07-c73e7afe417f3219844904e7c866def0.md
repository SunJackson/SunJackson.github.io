Data Science and Analytics is a very hot field, and demand for data scientists is still growing strongly. Many universities stepped in and created many degrees in the field, primarily Masters degrees.

Back in 2017, we ran a series of articles looking at the best of these degrees in America, Europe and Online. Luckily for you, we’ve now updated this comprehensive list and added lots more Masters programs.

We’ve already published our definitive guides to Online Master’s and across Europe and this post is going to look at programs throughout the USA and Canada.

Included is the CS Rank which is the top universities Computer and Information Systems graduate programs rank for ranks 1-50. Of course, this ranking isn’t 100% scientific in how it is calculated, but it does give a good idea of the schools that offer these courses. Universities that don’t appear on the rankings have been listed as having a ranking of NA.![](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/us-canada-number-of-courses.jpg)
