The creation of this blog post was prompted by this tweet, asking an age-old question:


This is actually a very important question, that I have been asking myself for a long time. An IDE,and plain text editors, are a very important tools to anyone writing code. Most working hours are spentwithin such a program, which means that one has to be careful about choosing the right one, andonce a choice is made, one has, in my humble opinion, learn as many features of this program aspossible to become as efficient as possible.

As you can notice from the tweet above, I suggested the use of Spacemacsâ€¦and my tweet did not get any likes or retweets. It is to set this great injustice straight that Idecided to write this blog post.

Spacemacs is a strange beast; if vi and Emacs had a baby, it would certainly look like Spacemacs.So first of all, to understand what is Spacemacs, one has to know a bit about vi and Emacs.

vi is a text editor with 43 years of history now. You might have heard of Vim (Vi IMproved) which is amodern clone of vi, from 1991. More recently, another clone has been getting popular, Neovim, startedin 2014. Whatever version of vi however, its basic way of functioning remains the same. vi is a modaleditor, meaning that the user has to switch between different modes to work on a text file.When vi is first started, the program will be in *Normal* mode. In this mode, trying to type a wordwill likely result in nothing, or unexpected behaviour; unexpected, if youâ€™re not familiar with vi.For instance, in *Normal* mode, typing **j** will not show the character **j** on your screen.Instead, this will move the cursor down one line. Typing **p** will paste, **u** will undo thelast action, **y** will yank (copy) etcâ€¦

To type text, first, one has to enter *Insert* mode, by typing **i** while in *Normal* mode. Onlythen is it possible to write text. To go back to *Normal* mode, type **ESC**. Other modes are*Visual* mode (from *Normal* mode press **v**), which allows the user to select text and *Command-line*mode which can be entered by keying **:** from *Normal* mode and allows to enter commands.

Now you might be wondering why anyone would use such a convoluted way to type text. Well, this isbecause one can chain these commands quite easily to perform repetitive tasks very quickly.For instance, to delete a word, one types **daw** (in *Normal* mode), **d**elete **a** **w**ord.To delete the next 3 words, you can type **3daw**. To edit the text between, for instance,the to edit, you would type **ci(** (while in *Normal* mode and anywhere between the brackets containingthe text to edit), **c**hange **i**n **(**. Same logic applies for **ci[** for instance. Can you guesswhat **ciw** does? If you are in *Normal* mode, and you want to change the word the cursor is on, thiscommand will erase the word and put you in *Insert* mode so that you can write the new word.

These are just basic reasons why vi (or its clones) are awesome. It is also possible to automatevery long and complex tasks using macros. One starts a macro by typing **q** and then any letter ofthe alphabet to name it, for instance **a**. The user then performs the actions needed, types **q**again to stop the recording of the macro, and can then execute the macro with **@a**. If the userneeds to execute the macro say, 10 times, **[email protected]â€Œâ€Œa** does the trick. It is possible to extend viâ€™sfunctionalities by using plugins, but more on that down below.

vi keybindings have inspired a lot of other programs. For instance, you can get extensionsfor popular web browsers that mimick vi keybindings, such asTridayctl for Firefox, or Viviumfor Chromium (or Google Chrome). There are even browsers that are built from scratch with supportfor vi keybinds, such as my personal favorite, qutebrowser. You can evengo further and use a tiling window manager on GNU-Linux, for instance i3, whichI use, or xmonad. You might need to configure those to behave more like vi,but it is possible. This means that by learning one set of keyboard shortcuts,(and the logic behind chaining the keystrokes to achieve what you want), you can master severaldifferent programs. This blog post only deals with the editor part, but as you can see, if yougo down the rabbit hole enough, a new exciting world opens up.

I will show some common vi operations below, but before that letâ€™s discuss Emacs.

I am not really familiar with Emacs; I know that Emacs users only swear by it (just like vi usersonly swear by vi), and that Emacs is not a modal editor. However, it contains a lot of functionsthat you can use by pressing **ESC**, **CTRL**, **ALT** or **META** (**META** is the Windows key on aregular PC keyboard) followed by regular keys. So the approach is different, but it is widelyaccepted that productivity of proficient Emacs users is very high too. Emacs was started in 1985,and the most popular clone is GNU Emacs. Emacs also features modes, but not in the same sense as vi.There are major and minor modes.For instance, if youâ€™re editing a Python script, Emacs will be in Python mode, or if editing a Markdownfile Emacs will be in Markdown mode. This will change the available functions to the user, as wellas provide other niceties, such as auto-completion.Emacs is also easily extensible, which is another reason why it is so popular.Users can install packages for Emacs, just like R users would do for R, to extend Emacsâ€™ capabilities.For instance, a very important package if you plan to use Emacs for statistics or data science is`ESS`, `E`macs `S`peaks `S`tatistics. Emacs contains other very high quality packages, and it seemsto me (but donâ€™t quote me on that) that Emacsâ€™ packages are more mature and feature-rich than viâ€™splugins. However, vi keybindings are really awesome. This is, I believe, whatSylvain Benner was thinking when he developed Spacemacs.

Spacemacsâ€™ motto is that *The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, itâ€™s Emacs and Vim!*.Spacemacs is a version, or distribution of Emacs, that has a very specific way of doing things. However,since itâ€™s built on top of Emacs, all of Emacsâ€™ packages are available to the user, notably *Evil*,which is a package that makes Emacs mimick viâ€™s modal mode and keybindings (the name of thispackage tells you everything you need to know about what Emacs users think of vi users ğŸ˜€)

Not only does Spacemacs support Emacs packages, but Spacemacs also features so-called *layers*, whichare configuration files that integrate one, or several packages, seamlessly into Spacemacs particularworkflow. This particular workflow is what gave Spacemacs its name.Instead of relying on **ESC**, **CTRL**, **ALT** or **META** like Emacs, users can launch functionsby typing **Space** in *Normal* mode and then a sequence of letters. For instance, **Spaceqr** restarts Spacemacs.And whatâ€™s more, you donâ€™t actually need to learn these new key sequences. When you type **Space**,the minibuffer, a little popup window at the bottom of Spacemacs, appears and shows you all the optionsthat you can type. For instance, typing **b** after **Space** opens up the buffer menu. Buffers arewhat could be called tabs in Rstudio. Here you can chose to *delete* a buffer, with **d**, createa new buffer with **N**, and many more options.

Enough text, letâ€™s get into the videos. But keep in mind the following: the videos below show thekeystrokes I am typing to perform the actions. However, because I use the BÃ‰PO keyboard layout,which is the french equivalent of the DVORAK layout, the keystrokes will be different than thosein a regular vi guide, which are mainly written for the QWERTY layout.Also, to use Spacemacs for R, you need to enable the **ESS** layer, which I show how to do at the end.Enabling this layer will turn on auto-completion, as well as provide documentation in real timefor your function in the minibuffer:

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.brodrigues.co/blog/2019-05-19-spacemacs/img/spacemacs_autocompletion.png?w=456)

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.brodrigues.co/blog/2019-05-19-spacemacs/img/spacemacs_doc.png?w=456)


The first video shows Spacemacs divided into two windows. On the left, I am navigating around codeusing the **T** (move down) and **S** (move up) keys. To execute a region that I select, I type**Spacemrr** (this stands for **M**ajor mode **R**un **R**egion). Then around second 5, I key **O**which switches to *Insert* mode one line below the line I was, type `head(mtcars)` and then**ESC** to switch back to *Normal* mode and run the line with**Spacemrl** (**M**ajor mode **R**un **L**ine).





In this video, I show you how to switch between windows. Type **SpaceN** to switch to window N. Atthe end, I key **dd** which deletes a whole line.





In the video below, I show how to use the pipe operator with **Spacemm**. This is a keyboard shortcutthat I have defined myself. You can also spot the auto-completion at work in this video. To runthe code, I first select it with **V**, which selects the whole line the cursor is currently atand enters *Visual* mode. I then select the lines below with **T** and run the region with **Spacemrr**.





Here I show how plotting behaves. When a plot is created, a new window is opened with the plot. Thisis a major shortcoming of using Spacemacs for R programming; there is not a dedicated buffer forplots, and it only shows the very last one created, so there is no way to keep all the plots created inthe current session in a neat, dedicated buffer. It seems to be possible usingOrg-mode,which is an Emacs mode for writing notes, todos, and authoring documents. But I havenâ€™t exploredthis option yet, mainly because in my case, only looking at one plot at a time is ok.





Here I show how to quickly add text to the top of the document when at the cursor is at the bottom: I try to usethe `tabyl()` function found in the `{janitor}` package, which I forgot to load. I quickly go all theway up with **gg**, then key **yy** to copy the first line, then **P** to paste it on the line below(**p** would paste it on the same line), type **fv**, to **f**ind the letter v from the word â€œtidyverseâ€�,then type **liw** (which is the BÃ‰PO equivalent of **ciw** for **C**hange **I**n **W**ord) andfinally change â€œtidyverseâ€� to â€œjanitorâ€�. This seems overly complex, but once you get used to thisway of working, you will wonder why you hadnâ€™t tried vi sooner.





Here I show how to do block comment. **8gg** jumps to the 8th line, **CTRLv** starts block visualmode, which allows me to select a block of text. I select the first column of the text, **G** tojump all the way down, then **A** to enter insert mode at the end of the selection (actually, itwould have been more logical to use **I**, which enters insert mode at the beginning of the selection)of the line and then add â€œ#â€� to comment.





Here I show how to delete a block of text:





Search and replace, by entering *command-line* mode (look at the very bottom of the window):





I forgot to add â€œ,â€� characters on a bunch of lines. I add the first â€œ,â€� to the first line, go downand press **ESC** to exit *Insert* mode. Now in **Normal** mode, I type **.** to execute the lastcommand, which is *inserting a â€œ,â€� character and going down a line*. This *dot command* is a featureof vi, and it will always redo the last performed change.





But instead of typing **.** six times, just type **6.** and be done with it:





What if you want to do something more complex, involving several commands? Here the *dot command*wonâ€™t be enough, since it only replicates the last command, not more. For this youcan define macros with **@**. I look for the â€œ,â€� character, twice, and put the rest of the charactersin the next line with enter. I then repeat this operation by executing the macro using **@â€Œâ€Œa**repeatedly (**@â€Œâ€Œa** because I saved the actions in **a**, but it could have been any other letter).I then undo my changes and execute the macro 5 times with **[email protected]â€Œâ€Œa**.





Here I show the undo tree (by typing **Spaceua**), which is a feature Spacemacs inherited fromEmacs: it makes undoing changes and going back to a previous version of your script very easily:





Finally, I show my Spacemacs configuration file. I show where one needs to specify the layers one wishesto use. For R, the ESS layer (which is a configuration file for the ESS Emacs package) is mandatory.As I explained above, it is also possible to use Emacs packages for which no layer is available.These are the packages under `dotspacemacs-additional-packages`. In my case I use:

```
dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(polymode
 poly-R
 poly-noweb
 poly-markdown)
```

which makes working with RMarkdown possible. `polymode` enables simultaneous Major modes, which isneeded for RMarkdown (because RMarkdown files mix Markdown and R).





Thatâ€™s the end of this long post. Spacemacs is really a joy to use, but the learning curve is quitesteep. However, it is definitely worth it. There are so many packages available for Emacs (and henceSpacemacs) that allow you to browse the web, play games, listen to music, send and read emailsâ€¦that a recurrent joke is that Emacs is *a very nice operating system, but it lacksa decent editor*. If thatâ€™s the case, Spacemacs is the perfect operating system, because it includesthe greatest editor, vi.

If youâ€™re interested and and want to learn more about vi, I advise you to read the following bookVim Recipes (pdf warning, free)or Practical Vim, Edit Text at the Speed of thought(not free, but worth every cent), and Use Vim Like a Pro, whichI have not read, but it looks quite good, and is free too if you want. Now this only covers thevi part, not the Emacs aspects of Spacemacs, but you donâ€™t really need to know about Emacs touse Spacemacs. I had 0 experience with Emacs, and still have 0 experience with it. I only learnedhow to configure Spacemacs, which does not require any previous experience. To find the packagesyou need, as usual, use any search engine of your liking.

The last point I want to address is the built-in Vim mode of Rstudio. While it works, it does notwork 100% as regular Vim, and worst of all, does not support, as far as I know, any other keyboardlayout than QWERTY, which is a nogo for me.

In any case, if youâ€™re looking to learn something new that you can use for many programs, includingRstudio, learn Vim, and then give Spacemacs a try. Chaining keystrokes to edit text gets addictivevery quickly.
