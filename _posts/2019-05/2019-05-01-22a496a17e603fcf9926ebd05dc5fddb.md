Medicine is always evolving, but healthcare as an industry struggles to incorporate data analytics into their workflows.  We sat down with a crew of expert researchers, data scientists, and clinicians with a plethora of applications for how analytics and machine learning can help doctors, nurses, technicians, and patients have better experiences and outcomes. 

But don't take our word for it; check out some of the videos and projects from the doctors we consulted. They're all focused on different domains within healthcare, but are unified in their belief that analytics and data can help improve medicine and give patients peace of mind.
