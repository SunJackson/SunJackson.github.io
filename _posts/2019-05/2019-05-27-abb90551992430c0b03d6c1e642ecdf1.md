Another minor maintenance release of the nanotime package for working with nanosecond timestamps arrived on CRAN yesterday.

nanotime uses the RcppCCTZ package for (efficient) high(er) resolution time parsing and formatting up to nanosecond resolution, and the bit64 package for the actual `integer64` arithmetic. Initially implemented using the S3 system, it now uses a more rigorous S4-based approach thanks to a rewrite by Leonardo Silvestri.

This release adds the `[[` accessor; this had not come up before in direct use or via data.table (which, to its credit, has supported nanotime for years already). But it came up in another usage pattern so we quickly added it as it it really is merely a dispatch to the excellent bit64 package underlying this.

Changes in version 0.2.4 (2019-05-25)

- Define [[ method (Dirk in #45 fixing #44).



We also have a diff to the previous version thanks to CRANberries. More details and examples are at the nanotime page; code, issue tickets etc at the GitHub repository.
