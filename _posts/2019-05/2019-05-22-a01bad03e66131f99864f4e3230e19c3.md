This paper proposes a tutorial on the Data Clustering technique using the Particle Swarm Optimization approach. Following the work proposed by Merwe et al. here we present an in-deep analysis of the algorithm together with a Matlab implementation and a short tutorial that explains how to modify the proposed implementation and the effect of the parameters of the original algorithm. Moreover, we provide a comparison against the results obtained using the well known K-Means approach. All the source code presented in this paper is publicly available under the GPL-v2 license.
