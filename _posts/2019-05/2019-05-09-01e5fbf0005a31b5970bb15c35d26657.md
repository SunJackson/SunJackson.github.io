### RStudio Team Standard and RStudio Team Enterprise

RStudio Team is available in two configurations: Standard and Enterprise.

**RStudio Team Standard – an affordable place to start for smaller teams**

Team Standard fits the needs and budgets of smaller businesses and data science departments. For 5 RStudio Server Pro users and 20 RStudio Connect users sharing RStudio Package Manager Base, RStudio Team Standard starts at $22,000 per year. SMB and Academic discounts can further reduce the starting price, ensuring that every professional data science team can afford to start out with the right solution.

**RStudio Team Enterprise – unrestricted servers for larger deployments**

Team Enterprise has it all. For 10 RStudio Server Pro users and 100 RStudio Connect users sharing RStudio Package Manager Enterprise, RStudio Team Enterprise starts at $58,000, including all development, production, staging, high-availability, and disaster-recovery servers you require. With RStudio Team Enterprise, servers are unrestricted so you can deploy the professional data science configuration your teams need and support the virtualized IT infrastructure your organization wants. SMB, Academic, and volume discounts also apply.
