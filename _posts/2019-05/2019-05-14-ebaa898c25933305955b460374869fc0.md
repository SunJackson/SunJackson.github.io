**Machine Vision in the Context of Robotics: A Systematic Literature Review**

Machine vision is critical to robotics due to a wide range of applications which rely on input from visual sensors such as autonomous mobile robots and smart production systems. To create the smart homes and systems of tomorrow, an overview about current challenges in the research field would be of use to identify further possible directions, created in a systematic and reproducible manner. In this work a systematic literature review was conducted covering research from the last 10 years. We screened 172 papers from four databases and selected 52 relevant papers. While robustness and computation time were improved greatly, occlusion and lighting variance are still the biggest problems faced. From the number of recent publications, we conclude that the observed field is of relevance and interest to the research community. Further challenges arise in many areas of the field.

**Bayesian Optimization using Deep Gaussian Processes**

Bayesian Optimization using Gaussian Processes is a popular approach to deal with the optimization of expensive black-box functions. However, because of the a priori on the stationarity of the covariance matrix of classic Gaussian Processes, this method may not be adapted for non-stationary functions involved in the optimization problem. To overcome this issue, a new Bayesian Optimization approach is proposed. It is based on Deep Gaussian Processes as surrogate models instead of classic Gaussian Processes. This modeling technique increases the power of representation to capture the non-stationarity by simply considering a functional composition of stationary Gaussian Processes, providing a multiple layer structure. This paper proposes a new algorithm for Global Optimization by coupling Deep Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization. The specificities of this optimization method are discussed and highlighted with academic test cases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on analytical test cases and an aerospace design optimization problem and compared to the state-of-the-art stationary and non-stationary Bayesian Optimization approaches.

**Unified Adversarial Invariance**

We present a unified invariance framework for supervised neural networks that can induce independence to nuisance factors of data without using any nuisance annotations, but can additionally use labeled information about biasing factors to force their removal from the latent embedding for making fair predictions. Invariance to nuisance is achieved by learning a split representation of data through competitive training between the prediction task and a reconstruction task coupled with disentanglement, whereas that to biasing factors is brought about by penalizing the network if the latent embedding contains any information about them. We describe an adversarial instantiation of this framework and provide analysis of its working. Our model outperforms previous works at inducing invariance to nuisance factors without using any labeled information about such variables, and achieves state-of-the-art performance at learning independence to biasing factors in fairness settings.

**Finding Optimal Longest Paths by Dynamic Programming in Parallel**

We propose an exact algorithm for solving the longest simple path problem between two given vertices in undirected weighted graphs. By using graph partitioning and dynamic programming, we obtain an algorithm that is significantly faster than other state-of-the-art methods. This enables us to solve instances that were previously unsolved and solve hard instances significantly faster. Lastly, we present a scalable parallelization which yields the first efficient parallel algorithm for the problem.

**AI Enabling Technologies: A Survey**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the opportunity to revolutionize the way the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) address the challenges of evolving threats, data deluge, and rapid courses of action. Developing an end-to-end artificial intelligence system involves parallel development of different pieces that must work together in order to provide capabilities that can be used by decision makers, warfighters and analysts. These pieces include data collection, data conditioning, algorithms, computing, robust artificial intelligence, and human-machine teaming. While much of the popular press today surrounds advances in algorithms and computing, most modern AI systems leverage advances across numerous different fields. Further, while certain components may not be as visible to end-users as others, our experience has shown that each of these interrelated components play a major role in the success or failure of an AI system. This article is meant to highlight many of these technologies that are involved in an end-to-end AI system. The goal of this article is to provide readers with an overview of terminology, technical details and recent highlights from academia, industry and government. Where possible, we indicate relevant resources that can be used for further reading and understanding.

**Importance Weighted Hierarchical Variational Inference**

Variational Inference is a powerful tool in the Bayesian modeling toolkit, however, its effectiveness is determined by the expressivity of the utilized variational distributions in terms of their ability to match the true posterior distribution. In turn, the expressivity of the variational family is largely limited by the requirement of having a tractable density function. To overcome this roadblock, we introduce a new family of variational upper bounds on a marginal log density in the case of hierarchical models (also known as latent variable models). We then give an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and derive a family of increasingly tighter variational lower bounds on the otherwise intractable standard evidence lower bound for hierarchical variational distributions, enabling the use of more expressive approximate posteriors. We show that previously known methods, such as Hierarchical Variational Models, Semi-Implicit Variational Inference and Doubly Semi-Implicit Variational Inference can be seen as special cases of the proposed approach, and empirically demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in a set of experiments.

**Submodular Optimization Problems and Greedy Strategies: A Survey**

The greedy strategy is an approximation algorithm to solve optimization problems arising in decision making with multiple actions. How good is the greedy strategy compared to the optimal solution? In this survey, we mainly consider two classes of optimization problems where the objective function is submodular. The first is set submodular optimization, which is to choose a set of actions to optimize a set submodular objective function, and the second is string submodular optimization, which is to choose an ordered set of actions to optimize a string submodular function. Our emphasis here is on performance bounds for the greedy strategy in submodular optimization problems. Specifically, we review performance bounds for the greedy strategy, more general and improved bounds in terms of curvature, performance bounds for the batched greedy strategy, and performance bounds for Nash equilibria.

**AutoAssist: A Framework to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks**

Deep neural networks have yielded superior performance in many applications; however, the gradient computation in a deep model with millions of instances lead to a lengthy training process even with modern GPU/TPU hardware acceleration. In this paper, we propose AutoAssist, a simple framework to accelerate training of a deep neural network. Typically, as the training procedure evolves, the amount of improvement in the current model by a stochastic gradient update on each instance varies dynamically. In AutoAssist, we utilize this fact and design a simple instance shrinking operation, which is used to filter out instances with relatively low marginal improvement to the current model; thus the computationally intensive gradient computations are performed on informative instances as much as possible. We prove that the proposed technique outperforms vanilla SGD with existing importance sampling approaches for linear SVM problems, and establish an O(1/k) convergence for strongly convex problems. In order to apply the proposed techniques to accelerate training of deep models, we propose to jointly train a very lightweight Assistant network in addition to the original deep network referred to as Boss. The Assistant network is designed to gauge the importance of a given instance with respect to the current Boss such that a shrinking operation can be applied in the batch generator. With careful design, we train the Boss and Assistant in a nonblocking and asynchronous fashion such that overhead is minimal. We demonstrate that AutoAssist reduces the number of epochs by 40% for training a ResNet to reach the same test accuracy on an image classification data set and saves 30% training time needed for a transformer model to yield the same BLEU scores on a translation dataset.

**Comparison Between Bayesian and Frequentist Tail Probability Estimates**

In this paper, we investigate the reasons that the Bayesian estimator of the tail probability is always higher than the frequentist estimator. Sufficient conditions for this phenomenon are established both by using Jensen’s Inequality and by looking at Taylor series approximations, both of which point to the convexity of the distribution function.

**Embedding Human Knowledge in Deep Neural Network via Attention Map**

Human-in-the-loop (HITL), which introduces human knowledge to machine learning, has been used in fine-grained recognition to estimate categories from the difference of local features. The conventional HITL approach has been successfully applied in non-deep machine learning, but it is difficult to use it with deep learning due to the enormous number of model parameters. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose using the Attention Branch Network (ABN) which is a visual explanation model. ABN applies an attention map for visual explanation to an attention mechanism. First, we manually modify the attention map obtained from ABN on the basis of human knowledge. Then, we use the modified attention map to an attention mechanism that enables ABN to adjust the recognition score. Second, for applying HITL to deep learning, we propose a fine-tuning approach that uses the modified attention map. Our fine-tuning updates the attention and perception branches of the ABN by using the training loss calculated from the attention map output from the ABN along with the modified attention map. This fine-tuning enables the ABN to output an attention map corresponding to human knowledge. Additionally, we use the updated attention map with its embedded human knowledge as an attention mechanism and inference at the perception branch, which improves the performance of ABN. Experimental results with the ImageNet dataset, CUB-200-2010 dataset, and IDRiD demonstrate that our approach clarifies the attention map in terms of visual explanation and improves the classification performance.

**Learning Representations for Predicting Future Activities**

Foreseeing the future is one of the key factors of intelligence. It involves understanding of the past and current environment as well as decent experience of its possible dynamics. In this work, we address future prediction at the abstract level of activities. We propose a network module for learning embeddings of the environment’s dynamics in a self-supervised way. To take the ambiguities and high variances in the future activities into account, we use a multi-hypotheses scheme that can represent multiple futures. We demonstrate the approach by classifying future activities on the Epic-Kitchens and Breakfast datasets. Moreover, we generate captions that describe the future activities

The system consists of a voice-based input interface, an automatic topic expansion module, and an image projection module. The key innovation is to inject Artificial Imagination into painting creation by considering lexical and phonological similarities of language, learning and inheriting artist’s original painting style, and applying the principles of Dadaism and impossibility of improvisation. Our system indicates that AI and artist can collaborate seamlessly to create imaginative artistic painting and Mappa Mundi has been applied in art exhibition in UCCA, Beijing

**Seesaw-Net: Convolution Neural Network With Uneven Group Convolution**

In this paper, we are interested in boosting the representation capability of convolution neural networks which utilizing the inverted residual structure. Based on the success of Inverted Residual structure[Sandler et al. 2018] and Interleaved Low-Rank Group Convolutions[Sun et al. 2018], we rethink this two pattern of neural network structure, rather than NAS(Neural architecture search) method[Zoph and Le 2017; Pham et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018b], we introduce uneven point-wise group convolution, which provide a novel search space for designing basic blocks to obtain better trade-off between representation capability and computational cost. Meanwhile, we propose two novel information flow patterns that will enable cross-group information flow for multiple group convolution layers with and without any channel permute/shuffle operation. Dense experiments on image classification task show that our proposed model, named Seesaw-Net, achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance with limited computation and memory cost. Our code will be open-source and available together with pre-trained models.

**Learning Loss for Active Learning**

The performance of deep neural networks improves with more annotated data. The problem is that the budget for annotation is limited. One solution to this is active learning, where a model asks human to annotate data that it perceived as uncertain. A variety of recent methods have been proposed to apply active learning to deep networks but most of them are either designed specific for their target tasks or computationally inefficient for large networks. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method that is simple but task-agnostic, and works efficiently with the deep networks. We attach a small parametric module, named ‘loss prediction module,’ to a target network, and learn it to predict target losses of unlabeled inputs. Then, this module can suggest data that the target model is likely to produce a wrong prediction. This method is task-agnostic as networks are learned from a single loss regardless of target tasks. We rigorously validate our method through image classification, object detection, and human pose estimation, with the recent network architectures. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the previous methods over the tasks.

**Adversarial Defense Framework for Graph Neural Network**

Graph neural network (GNN), as a powerful representation learning model on graph data, attracts much attention across various disciplines. However, recent studies show that GNN is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. How to make GNN more robust? What are the key vulnerabilities in GNN? How to address the vulnerabilities and defense GNN against the adversarial attacks? In this paper, we propose DefNet, an effective adversarial defense framework for GNNs. In particular, we first investigate the latent vulnerabilities in every layer of GNNs and propose corresponding strategies including dual-stage aggregation and bottleneck perceptron. Then, to cope with the scarcity of training data, we propose an adversarial contrastive learning method to train the GNN in a conditional GAN manner by leveraging the high-level graph representation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \defmodel in improving the robustness of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Network and GraphSAGE, under various types of adversarial attacks.

**Approximate Bayesian computation with the Wasserstein distance**

A growing number of generative statistical models do not permit the numerical evaluation of their likelihood functions. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become a popular approach to overcome this issue, in which one simulates synthetic data sets given parameters and compares summaries of these data sets with the corresponding observed values. We propose to avoid the use of summaries and the ensuing loss of information by instead using the Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions of the observed and synthetic data. This generalizes the well-known approach of using order statistics within ABC to arbitrary dimensions. We describe how recently developed approximations of the Wasserstein distance allow the method to scale to realistic data sizes, and propose a new distance based on the Hilbert space-filling curve. We provide a theoretical study of the proposed method, describing consistency as the threshold goes to zero while the observations are kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows. Various extensions to time series data are discussed. The approach is illustrated on various examples, including univariate and multivariate g-and-k distributions, a toggle switch model from systems biology, a queueing model, and a L\’evy-driven stochastic volatility model.

**Compositional Coding for Collaborative Filtering**

Efficiency is crucial to the online recommender systems. Representing users and items as binary vectors for Collaborative Filtering (CF) can achieve fast user-item affinity computation in the Hamming space, in recent years, we have witnessed an emerging research effort in exploiting binary hashing techniques for CF methods. However, CF with binary codes naturally suffers from low accuracy due to limited representation capability in each bit, which impedes it from modeling complex structure of the data. In this work, we attempt to improve the efficiency without hurting the model performance by utilizing both the accuracy of real-valued vectors and the efficiency of binary codes to represent users/items. In particular, we propose the Compositional Coding for Collaborative Filtering (CCCF) framework, which not only gains better recommendation efficiency than the state-of-the-art binarized CF approaches but also achieves even higher accuracy than the real-valued CF method. Specifically, CCCF innovatively represents each user/item with a set of binary vectors, which are associated with a sparse real-value weight vector. Each value of the weight vector encodes the importance of the corresponding binary vector to the user/item. The continuous weight vectors greatly enhances the representation capability of binary codes, and its sparsity guarantees the processing speed. Furthermore, an integer weight approximation scheme is proposed to further accelerate the speed. Based on the CCCF framework, we design an efficient discrete optimization algorithm to learn its parameters. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art binarized CF methods (even achieves better performance than the real-valued CF method) by a large margin in terms of both recommendation accuracy and efficiency.

**Learning Interpretable Features via Adversarially Robust Optimization**

Neural networks are proven to be remarkably successful for classification and diagnosis in medical applications. However, the ambiguity in the decision-making process and the interpretability of the learned features is a matter of concern. In this work, we propose a method for improving the feature interpretability of neural network classifiers. Initially, we propose a baseline convolutional neural network with state of the art performance in terms of accuracy and weakly supervised localization. Subsequently, the loss is modified to integrate robustness to adversarial examples into the training process. In this work, feature interpretability is quantified via evaluating the weakly supervised localization using the ground truth bounding boxes. Interpretability is also visually assessed using class activation maps and saliency maps. The method is applied to NIH ChestX-ray14, the largest publicly available chest x-rays dataset. We demonstrate that the adversarially robust optimization paradigm improves feature interpretability both quantitatively and visually.
