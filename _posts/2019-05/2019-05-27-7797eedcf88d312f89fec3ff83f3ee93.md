New release: **startup** 0.12.0 is now on CRAN. This version introduces support for processing some of the R startup files with a certain frequency, e.g. once per day, once per week, or once per month. See below for two examples.

*startup::startup() is cross platform.*

The startup package makes it easy to split up a long, complicated `.Rprofile` startup file into multiple, smaller files in a `.Rprofile.d/` folder. For instance, setting R option `repos` in a separate file `~/.Rprofile.d/repos.R` makes it easy to find and update the option. Analogously, environment variables can be configured by using multiple `.Renviron.d/` files. To make use of this, install the **startup** package, and then call `startup::install()` once, which will tweak your `~/.Rprofile` file and create `~/.Renviron.d/` and `~/.Rprofile.d/` folders, if missing. For an introduction, see Start Me Up.

## Example: Show a fortune once per hour

The **fortunes** package is a collection of quotes and wisdom related to the R language. By adding

```
if (interactive()) print(fortunes::fortune())

```

to our `~/.Rprofile` file, a random fortune will be displayed each time we start R, e.g.

```
$ R --quiet

I think, therefore I R.

```

Now, if we’re launching R frequently, it might be too much to see a new fortune each time R is started. With **startup** (>= 0.12.0), we can limit how often a certain startup file should be processed via `when=` declarations. Currently supported values are `when=once`, `when=hourly`, `when=daily`, `when=weekly`, `when=fortnighly`, and `when=monthly`. See the package vignette for more details.

For instance, we can limit ourselves to one fortune per hour, by creating a file `~/.Rprofile.d/interactive=TRUE/when=hourly/package=fortunes.R` containing:

```
print(fortunes::fortune())

```

The `interactive=TRUE` part declares that the file should only be processed in an interactive session, the `when=hourly` part that it should be processed at most once per hour, and the `package=fortunes` part that it should be processed only if the **fortunes** package is installed. It not all of these declarations are fulfilled, then the file will *not* be processed.

## Example: Check the status of your CRAN packages once per day

If you are a developer with one or more packages on CRAN, the **foghorn** package provides `foghorn::summary_cran_results()` which is a neat way to get a summary of the CRAN statuses of your packages. I use the following two files to display the summary of my CRAN packages once per day:

File `~/.Rprofile.d/interactive=TRUE/when=daily/package=foghorn.R`:

```
try(local({
 if (nzchar(email <- Sys.getenv("MY_CRAN_EMAIL"))) {
 foghorn::summary_cran_results(email)
 }
}), silent = TRUE)

```

File `~/.Renviron.d/private/me`:

```
[email protected]

```
