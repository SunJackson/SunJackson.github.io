Combining these different types of tools and platforms in one poll is somewhat messy, but it allows interesting association analysis afterwards, such as 
The 6 components of Open-Source Data Science/ Machine Learning Ecosystem.


This is the 20th such KDnuggets Poll, and several of the past polls suffered from excessive voting from some vendors. It is fine for vendors to ask their users to vote, but it is **not OK to set up bot voting or direct link to vote for just one tool**. 
To reduce excessive and bot voting, this poll asks for an email verification (*).


The irregular voting will be removed from final results, and we will publish the anonymized voter logs after the poll, so that anyone can analyze them.


We hope our analysis of this poll, trends, and results will useful, as they were in the past.
