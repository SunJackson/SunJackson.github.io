Iâ€™m using GitUgh links here b/c the issue was submitted there. Those not wishing to be surveilled by Microsoft can find the macOS QuickLook plugin project and `{rdatainfo}` project in SourceHut and GitLab (`~hrbrmstr` and `hrbrmstr` accounts respectively).

I hadnâ€™t touched `QuickLookR`![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 or `{rdatainfo}`![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)

 at all since 2016 since it was really just an example proof of concept. Yet the suggestion to have it handle R markdown (`Rmd`) files felt useful so I updated `{rdatainfo}` to better handle data loading for `rds`, `rdata`, and `rda` file extensions and made a small update to the macOS `{QuickLookR}` QuickLook extension project to treat `Rmd` files as text files which can be previewed then edited with the default Finder extension exitor youâ€™ve (or your apps) have set for `Rmd` files.

The `{rdatainfo}` package is only needed if you need/want R data file preview support (i.e. itâ€™s not necessary for R markdown files). Just unzip the plugin release and put it into `~/Library/QuickLook`. Here are examples for the four file types (the example code under `saveRDS()` and `save()` was used to generate those data files and the R markdown file is the default one):

### FIN

This is my first Xcode app build under macOS 10.14 so definitely file issues if youâ€™re having trouble installing or compiling (there are some new shared library â€œgotchasâ€� that I donâ€™t *think* apply to this Xcode project but may).
