**Person re-identification (PReID)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Intelligent video-surveillance is currently an active research field in computer vision and machine learning techniques. It provides useful tools for surveillance operators and forensic video investigators. Person re-identification (PReID) is one among these tools. It consists of recognizing whether an individual has already been observed over a camera in a network or not. This tool can also be employed in various possible applications such as off-line retrieval of all the video-sequences showing an individual of interest whose image is given a query, and online pedestrian tracking over multiple camera views. To this aim, many techniques have been proposed to increase the performance of PReID. Among the systems, many researchers utilized deep neural networks (DNNs) because of their better performance and fast execution at test time. Our objective is to provide for future researchers the work being done on PReID to date. Therefore, we summarized state-of-the-art DNN models being used for this task. A brief description of each model along with their evaluation on a set of benchmark datasets is given. Finally, a detailed comparison is provided among these models followed by some limitations that can work as guidelines for future research. … 

**Graybox Adversarial Training** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Adversarial samples are perturbed inputs crafted to mislead the machine learning systems. A training mechanism, called adversarial training, which presents adversarial samples along with clean samples has been introduced to learn robust models. In order to scale adversarial training for large datasets, these perturbations can only be crafted using fast and simple methods (e.g., gradient ascent). However, it is shown that adversarial training converges to a degenerate minimum, where the model appears to be robust by generating weaker adversaries. As a result, the models are vulnerable to simple black-box attacks. In this paper we, (i) demonstrate the shortcomings of existing evaluation policy, (ii) introduce novel variants of white-box and black-box attacks, dubbed gray-box adversarial attacks’ based on which we propose novel evaluation method to assess the robustness of the learned models, and (iii) propose a novel variant of adversarial training, named Graybox Adversarial Training’ that uses intermediate versions of the models to seed the adversaries. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the models trained using our method exhibit better robustness compared to both undefended and adversarially trained model … 

**EARL** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In order to answer natural language questions over knowledge graphs, most processing pipelines involve entity and relation linking. Traditionally, entity linking and relation linking has been performed either as dependent sequential tasks or independent parallel tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework, called EARL, which performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint single task. EARL is modeled on an optimised variation of GeneralisedTravelling Salesperson Problem. The system determines the best semantic connection between all keywords of the question by referring to the knowledge graph. This is achieved by exploiting the connection density between entity candidates and relation candidates. We have empirically evaluated the framework on a dataset with 3000 complex questions. Our system surpasses state-of-the-art scores for entity linking task by reporting an accuracy of 0.67against 0.40 from the next best entity linker …
