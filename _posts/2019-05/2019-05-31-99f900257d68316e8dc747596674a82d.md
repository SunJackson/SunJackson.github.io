Once again, we are delighted to announce a stellar line up of speakers for this year’s EARL Conference; from Retail and Insurance to Media, Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical, the range of industries now using R stats in their workflow continues to grow. 

If you are interested to hear why companies such as BBC News, BMW Group, Arla Foods, GSK, Microsoft, Hiscox, Mumsnet and Gym Group have turned to R, then you can get early bird priced tickets for a limited time.
