I would like to write a bit on the meaning and history of the phrase “tidy data.”




Hadley Wickham has been promoting the term “tidy data.” For example in an eponymous paper, he wrote:

> 
In tidy data:

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Wickham, Hadley “Tidy Data”, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 59, 2014.


Let’s try to apply this definition to following data set from the Wikipedia:
|Tournament|Year|Winner|Winner Date of Birth
|Indiana Invitational|1998|Al Fredrickson|21 July 1975|
|Cleveland Open|1999|Bob Albertson|28 September 1968|
|Des Moines Masters|1999|Al Fredrickson|21 July 1975|
|Indiana Invitational|1999|Chip Masterson|14 March 1977|

This would seem to be a nice “ready to analyze” data set. Rows are keyed by tournament and year, and rows carry additional key-derived observations of winner’s name and winner’s date of birth. From such a data set we could look for repeated winners, and look at the age of winners.

A question is: is such a data set “tidy”? The paper itself claims the above definitions are “Coddâ€™s 3rd normal form.” So, no the above table is not “tidy” under that paper’s definition. The the winner’s date of birth is a fact about the winner alone, and not a fact about the joint row keys (the tournament plus year) as required by the rules of Codd’s 3rd normal form. The critique being: this data presentation does not express the intended data invariant that Al Fredrickson must have the same “Winner Date of Birth” in all rows.

Around January of 2017 Hadley Wickham apparently retconned the “tidy data” definition to be:

> 
Tidy data is data where:

- Each variable is in a column.
- Each observation is a row.
- Each value is a cell.

Notice point-3 is now something possibly more related to Codd’s guaranteed access rule, and now the example table is plausibly “tidy.”

The above concept was already well known in statistics and called a “data matrix.” For example:

> 
A standard method of displaying a multivariate set of data is in the form of a *data matrix* in which rows correspond to sample individuals and columns to variables, so that the entry in the *i*th row and *j*th column gives the value of the *j*th variate as measured or observed on the *i*th individual.
