I had amazing weekend in Gdansk thanks to the satRday conference organized by Olgun Aydin, Ania Rybinska and Michal Maj. 

Together with Hanna Piotrowska we had a talk ,,Machine learning meets design. Design meets machine learning”. Hanna redesigned DALEX visualisations (DALEX is a set of tools for visual explanation of predictive ML models). During the talk she explained what and why was changed. 

See for example the metamorphosis of the Break Down explainer. How many differences can you spot?![](https://i1.wp.com/smarterpoland.pl/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-20-at-12.19.57-AM-e1558304565226.png?w=450)

Every change (axis, reading order, spacing, colors, descriptions, background, annotations) serves some purpose.

Find our presentation at slideshare. 

List of satRday talks (machine learning was quite popular).

Hanna design is implemented in ggplot2 thanks to Tomasz Mikołajczyk and in D3 thanks to Huber Baniecki! Find more examples of how to use new plots here.
