I’ve talked about the retailpocalypse before and this morning I was greeted with the news about Dressbarn closing all 650 stores as I fired up a browser.

I tweeted some pix and data but not everyone is on Twitter so I’m just posting a blog-blurb here with the code and data links.

Code is below and at https://paste.sr.ht/~hrbrmstr/af6da1af0314426255c65bc2fc254e0abb2190c3.

Data is at https://rud.is/dl/dressbarn-locations.json.gz.

Images are in a gallery below the code.

```
library(rvest)
library(stringi)
library(urltools)
library(worldtilegrid) # install from sh/gl/gh or just remove the theme_enhange_wtg() calls
library(statebins)
library(tidyverse)

# this is the dressbarn locations directory page
pg <- read_html("https://locations.dressbarn.com/")

# this is the selector to get the main links
html_nodes(pg, "a.Directory-listLink") %>% 
 html_attr("href") -> locs

# PRE-NOTE
# No sleep() code (I looked at the web site, saw how many self-requests it makes for all DB
# resources and concluded that link scrapes + full page captures would not be burdensome
# plus they're going out of business)

# basic idea here is to get all the main state location pages
# some states only have one store so the link goes right to that so handle that condition
# for ones with multiple stores get all the links on the state index page
# for links on state index page that have multiple stores in one area,
# grab all those; then, concatenate all the final target store links into one 
# character vector.

keep(locs, ~nchar(.x) == 2) %>% 
 sprintf("https://locations.dressbarn.com/%s", .) %>% # state has multiple listings
 map(
 ~read_html(.x) %>% 
 html_nodes("a.Directory-listLink") %>% 
 html_attr("href") %>% 
 sprintf("https://locations.dressbarn.com/%s", .)
 ) %>% 
 append(
 keep(locs, ~nchar(.x) > 2) %>% sprintf("https://locations.dressbarn.com/%s", .) # state has one store
 ) %>% 
 flatten_chr() %>% 
 map_if(
 ~stri_count_fixed(.x, "/") == 4, # 4 URL parts == there's another listing page layer
 ~read_html(.x) %>% 
 html_nodes("a.Teaser-titleLink") %>% 
 html_attr("href") %>% 
 stri_replace_first_fixed("../", "") %>% 
 sprintf("https://locations.dressbarn.com/%s", .)
 ) %>% 
 flatten_chr() -> listings

# make a tibble with the HTML source for the final store location pages
# so we don't end up doing multiple retrievals

tibble(
 listing = listings,
 html_src = map_chr(listings, ~httr::GET(.x) %>% httr::content(as = "text"))
) -> dress_barn

# save off our work in the event we have a (non-R-crashing) issue
tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".rds")
print(tf)
saveRDS(dress_barn, tf) 

# now, get data from the pages
# first, turn all the character vectors into something we can get HTML nodes from
#
# dressbarn web folks handliy put an "uber" link on each page so we get lon/lat for free in that URL
# they also handily used an semantic tag in the proper PostalAddress schema format
# so we can get locality and actual address, too
mutate(
 dress_barn,
 parsed = map(html_src, read_html),
 uber_link = 
 map_chr(
