**Stochastic Average Gradient Algorithm (SAGA)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this work we introduce a new optimisation method called SAGA in the spirit of SAG, SDCA, MISO and SVRG, a set of recently proposed incremental gradient algorithms with fast linear convergence rates. SAGA improves on the theory behind SAG and SVRG, with better theoretical convergence rates, and has support for composite objectives where a proximal operator is used on the regulariser. Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem. We give experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method. … 

**Castor** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We demonstrate Castor, a cloud-based system for contextual IoT time series data and model management at scale. Castor is designed to assist Data Scientists in (a) exploring and retrieving all relevant time series and contextual information that is required for their predictive modelling tasks; (b) seamlessly storing and deploying their predictive models in a cloud production environment; (c) monitoring the performance of all predictive models in productions and (semi-)automatically retraining them in case of performance deterioration. The main features of Castor are: (1) an efficient pipeline for ingesting IoT time series data in real time; (2) a scalable, hybrid data management service for both time series and contextual data; (3) a versatile semantic model for contextual information which can be easily adopted to different application domains; (4) an abstract framework for developing and storing predictive models in R or Python; (5) deployment services which automatically train and/or score predictive models upon user-defined conditions. We demonstrate Castor for a real-world Smart Grid use case and discuss how it can be adopted to other application domains such as Smart Buildings, Telecommunication, Retail or Manufacturing. … 

**BlurRing** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A code package, BlurRing, is developed as a method to allow for multi-dimensional likelihood visualisation. From the BlurRing visualisation additional information about the likelihood can be extracted. The spread in any direction of the overlaid likelihood curves gives information about the uncertainty on the confidence intervals presented in the two-dimensional likelihood plots. …
