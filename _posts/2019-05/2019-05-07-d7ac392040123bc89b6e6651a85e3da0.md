Business leaders are now coming to realize the profound impact the Data Revolution will have on every facet of their company. As a result, many are *increasing* investment in innovations fueled by AI, data science, and advanced analytics, yet many face challenges prioritizing and selecting which projects will be most impactful. To help, Metis will conduct a workshop on May 15 at 1pm ET entitled, *Start with Strategy: Building an Effective Data Science Project Portfolio for Your Business*.  Taught by Kerstin Frailey, Senior Data Scientist at Metis, the session will tackle the challenges of strategic planning for data science and how to overcome them.

“Although organizations of all stripes are increasing their investment in data science and analytics, many face huge challenges with adoption and recognizing the ROI,” said Mike Galvin, Executive Director of Corporate Training at Metis. “From our work helping Intel, Wells Fargo, and other top companies upskill their workforces, we know that a key difference between businesses that reap the benefits of AI and those that don’t is having a strong data and analytics business strategy."

Executing a sound data science strategy has moved from an innovative business advantage to a fundamental requirement for survival.  Executives, data science managers, and decision makers who understand this and want to ensure the effectiveness of the data science capabilities they are building, will leave equipped with the tools to:

- Critically evaluating and selecting pitched projects

- Building an impactful and high yield project portfolio

- Evolving your roadmap to quickly adapt to new opportunities
