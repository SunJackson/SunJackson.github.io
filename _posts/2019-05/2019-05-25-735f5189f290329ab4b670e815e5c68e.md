**Visualising high-dimensional state spaces with ‘Tuple Plots’**

Complex systems are described with high-dimensional data that is hard to visualise. Inselberg’s parallel coordinates are one representation technique for visualising high-dimensional data. Here we generalise Inselberg’s approach, and use it for visualising trajectories through high dimensional state spaces. We introduce two geometric projections of parallel coordinate representations — ‘plan tuple plots’ and ‘side tuple plots’ — and demonstrate a link between state space and ordinary space representations. We provide examples from many domains to illustrate use of the approach, including Cellular Automata, Random Boolean Networks, coupled logistic maps, reservoir computing, search algorithms, Turing Machines, and flocking.

**TopoResNet: A hybrid deep learning architecture and its application to skin lesion classification**

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States. As technological advancements are made, algorithmic diagnosis of skin lesions is becoming more important. In this paper, we develop algorithms for segmenting the actual diseased area of skin in a given image of a skin lesion, and for classifying different types of skin lesions pictured in a given image. The cores of the algorithms used were based in persistent homology, an algebraic topology technique that is part of the rising field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The segmentation algorithm utilizes a similar concept to persistent homology that captures the robustness of segmented regions. For classification, we design two families of topological features from persistence diagrams—which we refer to as {\em persistence statistics} (PS) and {\em persistence curves} (PC), and use linear support vector machine as classifiers. We also combined those topological features, PS and PC, into ResNet-101 model, which we call {\em TopoResNet-101}, the results show that PS and PC are effective in two folds—improving classification performances and stabilizing the training process. Although convolutional features are the most important learning targets in CNN models, global information of images may be lost in the training process. Because topological features were extracted globally, our results show that the global property of topological features provide additional information to machine learning models.

**Neurons Activation Visualization and Information Theoretic Analysis**

Understanding the inner working mechanism of deep neural networks (DNNs) is essential and important for researchers to design and improve the performance of DNNs. In this work, the entropy analysis is leveraged to study the neurons activation behavior of the fully connected layers of DNNs. The entropy of the activation patterns of each layer can provide a performance metric for the evaluation of the network model accuracy. The study is conducted based on a well trained network model. The activation patterns of shallow and deep layers of the fully connected layers are analyzed by inputting the images of a single class. It is found that for the well trained deep neural networks model, the entropy of the neuron activation pattern is monotonically reduced with the depth of the layers. That is, the neuron activation patterns become more and more stable with the depth of the fully connected layers. The entropy pattern of the fully connected layers can also provide guidelines as to how many fully connected layers are needed to guarantee the accuracy of the model. The study in this work provides a new perspective on the analysis of DNN, which shows some interesting results.

**ROI Regularization for Semi-supervised and Supervised Learning**

We propose ROI regularization (ROIreg) as a semi-supervised learning method for image classification. ROIreg focuses on the maximum probability of a posterior probability distribution g(x) obtained when inputting an unlabeled data sample x into a convolutional neural network (CNN). ROIreg divides the pixel set of x into multiple blocks and evaluates, for each block, its contribution to the maximum probability. A masked data sample x_ROI is generated by replacing blocks with relatively small degrees of contribution with random images. Then, ROIreg trains CNN so that g(x_ROI ) does not change as much as possible from g(x). Therefore, ROIreg can be said to refine the classification ability of CNN more. On the other hand, Virtual Adverserial Training (VAT), which is an excellent semi-supervised learning method, generates data sample x_VAT by perturbing x in the direction in which g(x) changes most. Then, VAT trains CNN so that g(x_VAT ) does not change from g(x) as much as possible. Therefore, VAT can be said to be a method to improve CNN’s weakness. Thus, ROIreg and VAT have complementary training effects. In fact, the combination of VAT and ROIreg improves the results obtained when using VAT or ROIreg alone. This combination also improves the state-of-the-art on ‘SVHN with and without data augmentation’ and ‘CIFAR-10 without data augmentation’. We also propose a method called ROI augmentation (ROIaug) as a method to apply ROIreg to data augmentation in supervised learning. However, the evaluation function used there is different from the standard cross-entropy. ROIaug improves the performance of supervised learning for both SVHN and CIFAR-10. Finally, we investigate the performance degradation of VAT and VAT+ROIreg when data samples not belonging to classification classes are included in unlabeled data.

**Smart Contract Development in Practice: Trends, Issues, and Discussions on Stack Overflow**

Blockchain based platforms are emerging as a transformative technology that can provide reliability, integrity, and auditability without trusted entities. One of the key features of these platforms is the trustworthy decentralized execution of general-purpose computation in the form of smart contracts, which are envisioned to have a wide range of applications from finance to the Internet of Things. As a result, a rapidly growing and active community of smart contract developers has emerged in recent years. A number of research efforts have investigated the technological challenges that smart contract developers face. However, very little is known about the community itself, about the developers, and about the issues that they discuss and care about. To address this gap, we study the online community of smart contract developers on Stack Overflow. We provide insight into the topics that they discuss, their technological and demographic background, and their awareness of security issues and tools. Our results show that the community of smart contract developers is very active and growing rapidly, in comparison with the general user population. However, a large fraction of smart contract related questions remain unanswered, which can pose a real threat to the viability of a sustainable community and may indicate gaps in community knowledge. Further, we observe very limited discussion of security related topics, which is concerning since smart contracts in practice are plagued by security issues.

**Enriching Pre-trained Language Model with Entity Information for Relation Classification**

Relation classification is an important NLP task to extract relations between entities. The state-of-the-art methods for relation classification are primarily based on Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Networks. Recently, the pre-trained BERT model achieves very successful results in many NLP classification / sequence labeling tasks. Relation classification differs from those tasks in that it relies on information of both the sentence and the two target entities. In this paper, we propose a model that both leverages the pre-trained BERT language model and incorporates information from the target entities to tackle the relation classification task. We locate the target entities and transfer the information through the pre-trained architecture and incorporate the corresponding encoding of the two entities. We achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the SemEval-2010 task 8 relational dataset.

**Citizen Science: An Information Quality Research Frontier**

The rapid proliferation of online content producing and sharing technologies resulted in an explosion of user-generated content (UGC), which now extends to scientific data. Citizen science, in which ordinary people contribute information for scientific research, epitomizes UGC. Citizen science projects are typically open to everyone, engage diverse audiences, and challenge ordinary people to produce data of highest quality to be usable in science. This also makes citizen science a very exciting area to study both traditional and innovative approaches to information quality management. With this paper we position citizen science as a leading information quality research frontier. We also show how citizen science opens a unique opportunity for the information systems community to contribute to a broad range of disciplines in natural and social sciences and humanities.

**A Neural Network Architecture for Learning Word-Referent Associations in Multiple Contexts**

This article proposes a biologically inspired neurocomputational architecture which learns associations between words and referents in different contexts, considering evidence collected from the literature of Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics. The multi-layered architecture takes as input raw images of objects (referents) and streams of word’s phonemes (labels), builds an adequate representation, recognizes the current context, and associates label with referents incrementally, by employing a Self-Organizing Map which creates new association nodes (prototypes) as required, adjusts the existing prototypes to better represent the input stimuli and removes prototypes that become obsolete/unused. The model takes into account the current context to retrieve the correct meaning of words with multiple meanings. Simulations show that the model can reach up to 78% of word-referent association accuracy in ambiguous situations and approximates well the learning rates of humans as reported by three different authors in five Cross-Situational Word Learning experiments, also displaying similar learning patterns in the different learning conditions.

**Tools for analyzing R code the tidy way**

With the current emphasis on reproducibility and replicability, there is an increasing need to examine how data analyses are conducted. In order to analyze the between researcher variability in data analysis choices as well as the aspects within the data analysis pipeline that contribute to the variability in results, we have created two R packages: matahari and tidycode. These packages build on methods created for natural language processing; rather than allowing for the processing of natural language, we focus on R code as the substrate of interest. The matahari package facilitates the logging of everything that is typed in the R console or in an R script in a tidy data frame. The tidycode package contains tools to allow for analyzing R calls in a tidy manner. We demonstrate the utility of these packages as well as walk through two examples.

**Raking and Regression Calibration: Methods to Address Bias from Correlated Covariate and Time-to-Event Error**

Medical studies that depend on electronic health records (EHR) data are often subject to measurement error as the data are not collected to support research questions under study. Methodology to address covariate measurement error has been well developed; however, time-to-event error has also been shown to cause significant bias but methods to address it are relatively underdeveloped. More generally, it is possible to observe errors in both the covariate and the time-to-event outcome that are correlated. We propose regression calibration (RC) estimators to simultaneously address correlated error in the covariates and the censored event time. Although RC can perform well in many settings with covariate measurement error, it is biased for nonlinear regression models, such as the Cox model. Thus, we additionally propose raking estimators which are consistent estimators of the parameter defined by the population estimating equations, can improve upon RC in certain settings with failure-time data, require no explicit modeling of the error structure, and can be utilized under outcome-dependent sampling designs. We discuss features of the underlying estimation problem that affect the degree of improvement the raking estimator has over the RC approach. Detailed simulation studies are presented to examine the performance of the proposed estimators under varying levels of signal, error, and censoring. The methodology is illustrated on observational EHR data on HIV outcomes from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic.

**Why Machines Cannot Learn Mathematics, Yet**

Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) is seen as the universal solution to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) methods. However, while mathematics is a precise and accurate science, it is usually expressed by less accurate and imprecise descriptions, contributing to the relative dearth of machine learning applications for IR in this domain. Generally, mathematical documents communicate their knowledge with an ambiguous, context-dependent, and non-formal language. Given recent advances in ML, it seems canonical to apply ML techniques to represent and retrieve mathematics semantically. In this work, we apply popular text embedding techniques to the arXiv collection of STEM documents and explore how these are unable to properly understand mathematics from that corpus. In addition, we also investigate the missing aspects that would allow mathematics to be learned by computers.

**Conditionally-additive-noise Models for Structure Learning**

Constraint-based structure learning algorithms infer the causal structure of multivariate systems from observational data by determining an equivalent class of causal structures compatible with the conditional independencies in the data. Methods based on additive-noise (AN) models have been proposed to further discriminate between causal structures that are equivalent in terms of conditional independencies. These methods rely on a particular form of the generative functional equations, with an additive noise structure, which allows inferring the directionality of causation by testing the independence between the residuals of a nonlinear regression and the predictors (nrr-independencies). Full causal structure identifiability has been proven for systems that contain only additive-noise equations and have no hidden variables. We extend the AN framework in several ways. We introduce alternative regression-free tests of independence based on conditional variances (cv-independencies). We consider conditionally-additive-noise (CAN) models, in which the equations may have the AN form only after conditioning. We exploit asymmetries in nrr-independencies or cv-independencies resulting from the CAN form to derive a criterion that infers the causal relation between a pair of variables in a multivariate system without any assumption about the form of the equations or the presence of hidden variables.

**Statistical methods research done as science rather than mathematics**

This paper is about how we study statistical methods. As an example, it uses the random regressions model, in which the intercept and slope of cluster-specific regression lines are modeled as a bivariate random effect. Maximizing this model’s restricted likelihood often gives a boundary value for the random effect correlation or variances. We argue that this is a problem; that it is a problem because our discipline has little understanding of how contemporary models and methods map data to inferential summaries; that we lack such understanding, even for models as simple as this, because of a near-exclusive reliance on mathematics as a means of understanding; and that math alone is no longer sufficient. We then argue that as a discipline, we can and should break open our black-box methods by mimicking the five steps that molecular biologists commonly use to break open Nature’s black boxes: design a simple model system, formulate hypotheses using that system, test them in experiments on that system, iterate as needed to reformulate and test hypotheses, and finally test the results in an ‘in vivo’ system. We demonstrate this by identifying conditions under which the random-regressions restricted likelihood is likely to be maximized at a boundary value. Resistance to this approach seems to arise from a view that it lacks the certainty or intellectual heft of mathematics, perhaps because simulation experiments in our literature rarely do more than measure a new method’s operating characteristics in a small range of situations. We argue that such work can make useful contributions including, as in molecular biology, the findings themselves and sometimes the designs used in the five steps; that these contributions have as much practical value as mathematical results; and that therefore they merit publication as much as the mathematical results our discipline esteems so highly.

**Time-varying Autoregression with Low Rank Tensors**

We present a windowed technique to learn parsimonious time-varying autoregressive models from multivariate timeseries. This unsupervised method uncovers spatiotemporal structure in data via non-smooth and non-convex optimization. In each time window, we assume the data follow a linear model parameterized by a potentially different system matrix, and we model this stack of system matrices as a low rank tensor. Because of its structure, the model is scalable to high-dimensional data and can easily incorporate priors such as smoothness over time. We find the components of the tensor using alternating minimization and prove that any stationary point of this algorithm is a local minimum. In a test case, our method identifies the true rank of a switching linear system in the presence of noise. We illustrate our model’s utility and superior scalability over extant methods when applied to several synthetic and real examples, including a nonlinear dynamical system, worm behavior, sea surface temperature, and monkey brain recordings.

**A Causality-Guided Prediction of the TED Talk Ratings from the Speech-Transcripts using Neural Networks**

Automated prediction of public speaking performance enables novel systems for tutoring public speaking skills. We use the largest open repository—TED Talks—to predict the ratings provided by the online viewers. The dataset contains over 2200 talk transcripts and the associated meta information including over 5.5 million ratings from spontaneous visitors to the website. We carefully removed the bias present in the dataset (e.g., the speakers’ reputations, popularity gained by publicity, etc.) by modeling the data generating process using a causal diagram. We use a word sequence based recurrent architecture and a dependency tree based recursive architecture as the neural networks for predicting the TED talk ratings. Our neural network models can predict the ratings with an average F-score of 0.77 which largely outperforms the competitive baseline method.

**Bayesian semiparametric analysis of multivariate continuous responses, with variable selection**

We develop models for multivariate Gaussian responses with nonparametric models for the means, the variances and the correlation matrix, with automatic variable selection based on spike-slab priors. We use the separation strategy to factorize the covariance matrix of the multivariate responses into a product of matrices involving the variances and the correlation matrix. We model the means and the logarithm of the variances nonparametrically, utilizing radial basis function expansion. We describe parametric and nonparametric models for the correlation matrix. The parametric model assumes a normal prior for the elements of the correlation matrix, constrained to lie in the space of correlation matrices while the nonparametric model is utilizes Dirichlet process mixtures of normal distributions. We discuss methods for posterior sampling and inference and present results from a simulation study and two applications. The software we implemented can handle response vectors of arbitrary dimension and it is freely available via R package BNSP.

**Generating Logical Forms from Graph Representations of Text and Entities**

Structured information about entities is critical for many semantic parsing tasks. We present an approach that uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to incorporate information about relevant entities and their relations during parsing. Combined with a decoder copy mechanism, this approach provides a conceptually simple mechanism to generate logical forms with entities. We demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art across several tasks without pre-training, and outperforms existing approaches when combined with BERT pre-training.

**Clustering with Similarity Preserving**

Graph-based clustering has shown promising performance in many tasks. A key step of graph-based approach is the similarity graph construction. In general, learning graph in kernel space can enhance clustering accuracy due to the incorporation of nonlinearity. However, most existing kernel-based graph learning mechanisms is not similarity-preserving, hence leads to sub-optimal performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a more discriminative graph learning method which can preserve the pairwise similarities between samples in an adaptive manner for the first time. Specifically, we require the learned graph be close to a kernel matrix, which serves as a measure of similarity in raw data. Moreover, the structure is adaptively tuned so that the number of connected components of the graph is exactly equal to the number of clusters. Finally, our method unifies clustering and graph learning which can directly obtain cluster indicators from the graph itself without performing further clustering step. The effectiveness of this approach is examined on both single and multiple kernel learning scenarios in several datasets.

**Efficient Estimation For The Cox Proportional Hazards Cure Model**

While analysing time-to-event data, it is possible that a certain fraction of subjects will never experience the event of interest and they are said to be cured. When this feature of survival models is taken into account, the models are commonly referred to as cure models. In the presence of covariates, the conditional survival function of the population can be modelled by using cure model which depends on the probability of being uncured (incidence) and the conditional survival function of the uncured subjects (latency), and a combination of logistic regression and Cox PH regression is used to model the incidence and latency respectively. In this paper, we take the profile likelihood approach to estimate the cumulative hazard and the regression parameters. We show the asymptotic normality of the profile likelihood estimator via asymptotic expansion of the profile likelihood and obtain the explicit form of the variance estimator. Moreover, the estimators of the regression parameters from the Cox PH cure model are shown to be semiparametric efficient. The numerical result of our proposed method is shown by using the melanoma data from SMCURE R-package (Cai et al., 2012) and we compare the results with the output obtained from SMCURE package.

**Inference for Change Points in High Dimensional Data**

This article considers change point testing and estimation for high dimensional data. In the case of testing for a mean shift, we propose a new test which is based on U-statistics and utilizes the self-normalization principle. Our test targets dense alternatives in the high dimensional setting and involves no tuning parameters. The weak convergence of a sequential U-statistic based process is shown as an important theoretical contribution. Extensions to testing for multiple unknown change points in the mean, and testing for changes in the covariance matrix are also presented with rigorous asymptotic theory and encouraging simulation results. Additionally, we illustrate how our approach can be used in combination with wild binary segmentation to estimate the number and location of multiple unknown change points.

**A User-Centered Concept Mining System for Query and Document Understanding at Tencent**

Concepts embody the knowledge of the world and facilitate the cognitive processes of human beings. Mining concepts from web documents and constructing the corresponding taxonomy are core research problems in text understanding and support many downstream tasks such as query analysis, knowledge base construction, recommendation, and search. However, we argue that most prior studies extract formal and overly general concepts from Wikipedia or static web pages, which are not representing the user perspective. In this paper, we describe our experience of implementing and deploying ConcepT in Tencent QQ Browser. It discovers user-centered concepts at the right granularity conforming to user interests, by mining a large amount of user queries and interactive search click logs. The extracted concepts have the proper granularity, are consistent with user language styles and are dynamically updated. We further present our techniques to tag documents with user-centered concepts and to construct a topic-concept-instance taxonomy, which has helped to improve search as well as news feeds recommendation in Tencent QQ Browser. We performed extensive offline evaluation to demonstrate that our approach could extract concepts of higher quality compared to several other existing methods. Our system has been deployed in Tencent QQ Browser. Results from online A/B testing involving a large number of real users suggest that the Impression Efficiency of feeds users increased by 6.01% after incorporating the user-centered concepts into the recommendation framework of Tencent QQ Browser.

**Deep Signatures**

The signature is an infinite graded sequence of statistics known to characterise a stream of data up to a negligible equivalence class. It is a transform which has previously been treated as a fixed feature transformation, on top of which a model may be built. We propose a novel approach which combines the advantages of the signature transform with modern deep learning frameworks. By learning an augmentation of the stream prior to the signature transform, the terms of the signature may be selected in a data-dependent way. More generally, we describe how the signature transform may be used as a layer anywhere within a neural network. In this context it may be interpreted as an activation function not operating element-wise. We present the results of empirical experiments to back up the theoretical justification. Code available at github.com/patrick-kidger/Deep-Signatures.

**PDH : Probabilistic deep hashing based on MAP estimation of Hamming distance**

With the growth of image on the web, research on hashing which enables high-speed image retrieval has been actively studied. In recent years, various hashing methods based on deep neural networks have been proposed and achieved higher precision than the other hashing methods. In these methods, multiple losses for hash codes and the parameters of neural networks are defined. They generate hash codes that minimize the weighted sum of the losses. Therefore, an expert has to tune the weights for the losses heuristically, and the probabilistic optimality of the loss function cannot be explained. In order to generate explainable hash codes without weight tuning, we theoretically derive a single loss function with no hyperparameters for the hash code from the probability distribution of the images. By generating hash codes that minimize this loss function, highly accurate image retrieval with probabilistic optimality is performed. We evaluate the performance of hashing using MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

**Data-driven preference learning methods for value-driven multiple criteria sorting with interacting criteria**

The learning of predictive models for data-driven decision support has been a prevalent topic in many fields. However, construction of models that would capture interactions among input variables is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a new preference learning approach for multiple criteria sorting with potentially interacting criteria. It employs an additive piecewise-linear value function as the basic preference model, which is augmented with components for handling the interactions. To construct such a model from a given set of assignment examples concerning reference alternatives, we develop a convex quadratic programming model. Since its complexity does not depend on the number of training samples, the proposed approach is capable for dealing with data-intensive tasks. To improve the generalization of the constructed model on new instances and to overcome the problem of over-fitting, we employ the regularization techniques. We also propose a few novel methods for classifying non-reference alternatives in order to enhance the applicability of our approach to different datasets. The practical usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a problem of parametric evaluation of research units, whereas its predictive performance is studied on several monotone learning datasets. The experimental results indicate that our approach compares favourably with the classical UTADIS method and the Choquet integral-based sorting model.

**Neighborhood Enlargement in Graph Neural Networks**

**Stochastic Inverse Reinforcement Learning**

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is an ill-posed inverse problem since expert demonstrations may infer many solutions of reward functions which is hard to recover by local search methods such as a gradient method. In this paper, we generalize the original IRL problem to recover a probability distribution for reward functions. We call such a generalized problem stochastic inverse reinforcement learning (SIRL) which is first formulated as an expectation optimization problem. We adopt the Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) method, a global search method, to estimate the parameter of the probability distribution as the first solution to SIRL. With our approach, it is possible to observe the deep intrinsic property in IRL from a global viewpoint, and the technique achieves a considerable robust recovery performance on the classic learning environment, objectworld.

**Adaptive Stochastic Natural Gradient Method for One-Shot Neural Architecture Search**

High sensitivity of neural architecture search (NAS) methods against their input such as step-size (i.e., learning rate) and search space prevents practitioners from applying them out-of-the-box to their own problems, albeit its purpose is to automate a part of tuning process. Aiming at a fast, robust, and widely-applicable NAS, we develop a generic optimization framework for NAS. We turn a coupled optimization of connection weights and neural architecture into a differentiable optimization by means of stochastic relaxation. It accepts arbitrary search space (widely-applicable) and enables to employ a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of weights and architecture (fast). We propose a stochastic natural gradient method with an adaptive step-size mechanism built upon our theoretical investigation (robust). Despite its simplicity and no problem-dependent parameter tuning, our method exhibited near state-of-the-art performances with low computational budgets both on image classification and inpainting tasks.

**A Two-stage Classification Method for High-dimensional Data and Point Clouds**

High-dimensional data classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and imaging science. In this paper, we propose a two-stage multiphase semi-supervised classification method for classifying high-dimensional data and unstructured point clouds. To begin with, a fuzzy classification method such as the standard support vector machine is used to generate a warm initialization. We then apply a two-stage approach named SaT (smoothing and thresholding) to improve the classification. In the first stage, an unconstraint convex variational model is implemented to purify and smooth the initialization, followed by the second stage which is to project the smoothed partition obtained at stage one to a binary partition. These two stages can be repeated, with the latest result as a new initialization, to keep improving the classification quality. We show that the convex model of the smoothing stage has a unique solution and can be solved by a specifically designed primal-dual algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed. We test our method and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark data sets. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that our method is superior in both the classification accuracy and computation speed for high-dimensional data and point clouds.

**Conditional Sum-Product Networks: Imposing Structure on Deep Probabilistic Architectures**

Bayesian networks are a central tool in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and make use of conditional independencies to impose structure on joint distributions. However, they are generally not as expressive as deep learning models and inference is hard and slow. In contrast, deep probabilistic models such as sum-product networks (SPNs) capture joint distributions in a tractable fashion, but use little interpretable structure. Here, we extend the notion of SPNs towards conditional distributions, which combine simple conditional models into high-dimensional ones. As shown in our experiments, the resulting conditional SPNs can be naturally used to impose structure on deep probabilistic models, allow for mixed data types, while maintaining fast and efficient inference.

**Similarity Measure Development for Case-Based Reasoning- A Data-driven Approach**

In this paper, we demonstrate a data-driven methodology for modelling the local similarity measures of various attributes in a dataset. We analyse the spread in the numerical attributes and estimate their distribution using polynomial function to showcase an approach for deriving strong initial value ranges of numerical attributes and use a non-overlapping distribution for categorical attributes such that the entire similarity range [0,1] is utilized. We use an open source dataset for demonstrating modelling and development of the similarity measures and will present a case-based reasoning (CBR) system that can be used to search for the most relevant similar cases.

**Geometric Estimation of Multivariate Dependency**

This paper proposes a geometric estimator of dependency between a pair of multivariate samples. The proposed estimator of dependency is based on a randomly permuted geometric graph (the minimal spanning tree) over the two multivariate samples. This estimator converges to a quantity that we call the geometric mutual information (GMI), which is equivalent to the Henze-Penrose divergence [1] between the joint distribution of the multivariate samples and the product of the marginals. The GMI has many of the same properties as standard MI but can be estimated from empirical data without density estimation; making it scalable to large datasets. The proposed empirical estimator of GMI is simple to implement, involving the construction of an MST spanning over both the original data and a randomly permuted version of this data. We establish asymptotic convergence of the estimator and convergence rates of the bias and variance for smooth multivariate density functions belonging to a H\'{o}lder class. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed geometric dependency estimator in a series of experiments.

**Generic Multilayer Network Data Analysis with the Fusion of Content and Structure**

Multi-feature data analysis (e.g., on Facebook, LinkedIn) is challenging especially if one wants to do it efficiently and retain the flexibility by choosing features of interest for analysis. Features (e.g., age, gender, relationship, political view etc.) can be explicitly given from datasets, but also can be derived from content (e.g., political view based on Facebook posts). Analysis from multiple perspectives is needed to understand the datasets (or subsets of it) and to infer meaningful knowledge. For example, the influence of age, location, and marital status on political views may need to be inferred separately (or in combination). In this paper, we adapt multilayer network (MLN) analysis, a nontraditional approach, to model the Facebook datasets, integrate content analysis, and conduct analysis, which is driven by a list of desired application based queries. Our experimental analysis shows the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed approach when modeling and analyzing datasets with multiple features.

**Joint embedding of structure and features via graph convolutional networks**

The creation of social ties is largely determined by the entangled effects of people’s similarities in terms of individual characters and friends. However, feature and structural characters of people usually appear to be correlated, making it difficult to determine which has greater responsibility in the formation of the emergent network structure. We propose \emph{AN2VEC}, a node embedding method which ultimately aims at disentangling the information shared by the structure of a network and the features of its nodes. Building on the recent developments of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), we develop a multitask GCN Variational Autoencoder where different dimensions of the generated embeddings can be dedicated to encoding feature information, network structure, and shared feature-network information. We explore the interaction between these disentangled characters by comparing the embedding reconstruction performance to a baseline case where no shared information is extracted. We use synthetic datasets with different levels of interdependency between feature and network characters and show (i) that shallow embeddings relying on shared information perform better than the corresponding reference with unshared information, (ii) that this performance gap increases with the correlation between network and feature structure, and (iii) that our embedding is able to capture joint information of structure and features. Our method can be relevant for the analysis and prediction of any featured network structure ranging from online social systems to network medicine.

**Topological Feature Vectors for Chatter Detection in Turning Processes**

Machining processes are most accurately described using complex dynamical systems that include nonlinearities, time delays and stochastic effects. Due to the nature of these models as well as the practical challenges which include time-varying parameters, the transition from numerical/analytical modeling of machining to the analysis of real cutting signals remains challenging. Some studies have focused on studying the time series of cutting processes using machine learning algorithms with the goal of identifying and predicting undesirable vibrations during machining referred to as chatter. These tools typically decompose the signal using Wavelet Packet Transforms (WPT) or Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, these methods require a significant overhead in identifying the feature vectors before a classifier can be trained. In this study, we present an alternative approach based on featurizing the time series of the cutting process using its topological features. We utilize support vector machine classifier combined with feature vectors derived from persistence diagrams, a tool from persistent homology, to encode distinguishing characteristics based on embedding the time series as a point cloud using Takens embedding. We present the results for several choices of the topological feature vectors, and we compare our results to the WPT and EEMD methods using experimental time series from a turning cutting test. Our results show that in most cases combining the TDA-based features with a simple Support Vector Machine (SVM) yields accuracies that either exceed or are within the error bounds of their WPT and EEMD counterparts.

**MultiWiki: Interlingual Text Passage Alignment in Wikipedia**

In this article we address the problem of text passage alignment across interlingual article pairs in Wikipedia. We develop methods that enable the identification and interlinking of text passages written in different languages and containing overlapping information. Interlingual text passage alignment can enable Wikipedia editors and readers to better understand language-specific context of entities, provide valuable insights in cultural differences and build a basis for qualitative analysis of the articles. An important challenge in this context is the trade-off between the granularity of the extracted text passages and the precision of the alignment. Whereas short text passages can result in more precise alignment, longer text passages can facilitate a better overview of the differences in an article pair. To better understand these aspects from the user perspective, we conduct a user study at the example of the German, Russian and the English Wikipedia and collect a user-annotated benchmark. Then we propose MultiWiki — a method that adopts an integrated approach to the text passage alignment using semantic similarity measures and greedy algorithms and achieves precise results with respect to the user-defined alignment. MultiWiki demonstration is publicly available and currently supports four language pairs.
