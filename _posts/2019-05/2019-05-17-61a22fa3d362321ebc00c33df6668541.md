*tl;dr - We are pleased to share that we now support a general synchronous Kernels-only (KO) format: when you submit a Kernel, Kaggle will run the code against both the public test set and a withheld private test set in real time. To kick things off, you're invited to join Instant Gratification, our first synchronous Kernels-only competition using our new framework.*

## Four Years of Kernels at Kaggle

In 2015, Kaggle introduced Kernels as a resource to competition participants. It was a controversial decision to add a code-sharing tool to a competitive coding space. We thought it was important to make Kaggle more than a place where competitions are solved behind closed digital doors. Since then, Kernels has grown from its infancy--essentially a blinking cursor in a docker container--into its teenage years. We now have more compute, longer runtimes, better datasets, GPUs, and an improved interface.

Kaggle introduced its first Kernels-only competition with Two Sigma in December of 2016 and received positive feedback on the format. For participants, it leveled the playing field and added the challenge of preserving efficiency in addition to accuracy. For hosts, it meant that competition solutions were reproducible, simpler, and eminently runnable.

We have since iterated and tested several KO formats with a true holdout test set, in particular deploying them when we would have otherwise substituted a two-stage competition. However, the experience of submitting to a Kernels-only competition has typically been asynchronous and imperfect; participants wait many days after a competition has concluded for their selected Kernels to be rerun on the holdout test dataset, the leaderboard updated, and the winners announced. This flow causes heartbreak to participants whose Kernels fail on the unseen test set, leaving them with no way to correct tiny errors that spoil months of hard work.

## Why Synchronous Kernels-only Competitions?

We’re now pleased to announce general support for a synchronous Kernels-only format. When you submit from a Kernel, Kaggle will run the code against both the public test set and private test set in real time. This small-but-substantial tweak improves the experience for participants, the host, and Kaggle:
- With a truly withheld test set, we are practicing proper, rigorous machine learning.
- We will be able to offer more varieties of competitions and intend to run many fewer confusing two-stage competitions.
- You will be able to see if your code runs successfully on the withheld test set and have the leeway to intervene if it fails.
- We will run all submissions against the private data, not just selected ones. Participants will get the complete and familiar public/private scores available in a traditional competition.
- The final leaderboard can be released at the end of the competition, without the delay of rerunning Kernels.

## Try it out

The Instant Gratification competition is a low-stakes, trial-run introduction to our new synchronous KO implementation. We want to test that the process goes smoothly and gather feedback on your experiences. While it may feel like a normal KO competition, there are complicated new mechanics in play, such as the selection logic of Kernels that are still running when the deadline passes.

Since the competition also presents an authentic machine learning problem, it will also award Kaggle medals and points. Get started by making a submission. Have fun, good luck, and welcome to the world of synchronous Kernels competitions!
