(TL;DR: Multiply a vector by a scalar one element at a time.)

Lasttime,we learnt about **`vectors`**. Beforethat,we learnt about **`scalars`**. What happens when we **multiply a vectorby a scalar**?

*(I don’t know where I’m going with this diagram…but bear with me!)*

Let’s use our vector from last time.


Let’s pick a **scalar** to multiply it by. I like the number two, solet’s multiply it by two!


To evaluate this, we perform **scalar multiplication**. That is, wemultiply **each element** of our vector by our scalar. Easy!


More generally, if our vector contains elementsand we multiply it by some scalar , we get:


How can we perform scalar multiplication in R?
This is easy. It’s what R does by default.

Let’s define our vector, **x**.

```
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
print(x)

```

Let’s define our scalar, **c**.

Now, let’s multiply our vector by our scalar.

Boom! **The power of vectorisation!**

## How does type coercion affect scalar multiplication?

The comments we made in an earlier post about **type coercion** applyhere. Let’s define **`x`** as an **integer vector**.

```
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
class(x)

```

Our scalar **`c`** may also look like an integer, but it has been storedas a **`numeric`** type, which is our proxy for **real numbers**.

So when we multiply a **`numeric`** type by our **`integer`** vector, weget a result in the more general **`numeric`** type!



To multiply a vector by a scalar, simply multiply each element of the vector by the scalar. This is pretty easy, isn’t it?

Let’s learn how to **add** two vectors before we cover **dot products**.Only then can we **enter the matrix!**
