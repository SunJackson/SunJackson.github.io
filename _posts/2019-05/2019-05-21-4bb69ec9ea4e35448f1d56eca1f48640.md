It has been just a little more than a day since I announced my new R package,`panelr`, to the wider world.


Quite frankly, I’ve been surprised by the level of attention! Some responseshave been calls for *economists* to check the package out (they are certainlywelcome to do so) as well as things along the lines of there finally beinga package for panel data in R. So let me make something clear: There’s at leastone comparable package for R, called `plm`, which is very good and should beparticularly appealing for economists. This leads to the understandable questionas to how `panelr` differs from `plm`.


The `plm` package has been around since 2006 and is quite good.I didn’t make `panelr` out of any kind of deep dissatisfaction with `plm` northe idea that it needed to be superseded.

Yves Croissant and Giovanni Millodiscuss in `plm`’s main vignette the fact that there is a great deal of overlap between econometrictreatment of panel data and other statistical approaches to panel data, likemultilevel modeling. They note, among, other things,

while a very comprehensive software framework for (among many other features) maximum likelihood estimation of linear regression models for longitudinal data, packages nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2007) and lme4 (Bates 2007), is available in the R environment and can be used, e.g., for estimation of random effects panel models, its use is not intuitive for a practicing econometrician, and maximum likelihood estimation is only one of the possible approaches to panel data econometrics.


and

Furthermore, we felt there was a need for automation of some basic data management tasks such as lagging, summing and, more in general, applying (in the R sense) functions to the data, which, although conceptually simple, become cumbersome and error-prone on two-dimensional data, especially in the case of unbalanced panels.


I totally agree with these things. I, however, am not an econometrician, so Icame to this area with the opposite problem as Croissant and Millo. I like andrespect `plm` a great deal, but

a package doing panel data “from the econometrician’s viewpoint”


is the opposite of what I was looking for. The way I am accustomed tothinking and talking about panel data analysis is different from the standardeconometric approach, for better or worse. My training in this area comes mostlyfrom sociologists, who are of course not ignorant of econometrics but havedifferent preferences and norms. There is a lot of overlap, but ultimately Iwas motivated to fit a type of model that I would not expect to see in `plm`even though it is closely related. Those efforts led to `panelr`.

So here’s the **TL;DR:**

- I wanted to simplify the fitting of panel models that use multilevelmodels for estimation, especially the kind that produces within-entity effectsequivalent to econometric fixed effects models.

- I subsequently wanted to streamline GEE estimation of these models.

- I wanted to create a function that estimates asymmetric effects models (Allison, 2019).

- The `panel_data` object inherits from grouped `tibbles` and should fit wellinto workflows that rely on the “tidyverse.”

- I have included tools that make reshaping data from wide to long and viceversa more user-friendly.

- The documentation and general approach talk about panel data in ways thatare more familiar to me and people similarly trained.


**Longer version:**

Bell and Jones (2015) describe a model specification for panel data that usesthe estimation technique econometricians would use for what they call “randomeffects” models but generates estimates equivalent to what econometricians call“fixed effects” models. This is achieved using multilevel (also known as mixed)models and including individual-level means of time-varying predictors in themodel. What you get are within-entity estimates (exactly equivalent tofixed effects) along with between-entity effect estimates, which are not robustto confounding from stable predictors but nonetheless may be of substantiveinterest. This further enables the analyst to include other time-stablecovariates, incorporate random slopes or additional grouping factors, and evenmove to generalized models (e.g., logit).

The equivalence of these models was first noted by Mundlak (1978).Multilevel modeling researchers have been estimating models like this for sometime (e.g., Kreft, de Leeuw, & Aiken, 1995; Hofmann & Gavin, 1998; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).Only recently has there been wider recognition of the near-equivalence offixed effects models and this multilevel model that I and some others refer toas the “within-between” model (Allison, 2009; Bell & Jones, 2015).

Wanting to fit these models is what got me started on the road to `panelr`.The transformations needed to properly fit the models were quite tedious and,to quote Croissant and Millo, I “felt there was a need for automation of somebasic data management tasks such as lagging, summing and, more in general,applying (in the R sense) functions to the data, which, although conceptuallysimple, become cumbersome and error-prone.” With the popularity of `dplyr` fordata manipulation, and the fact that it can make the necessary transformationsmuch easier, I thought others would find these tools to be useful andaccessible.

Later on, more models I was interested in became fairly straightforward to addto the package. GEE estimation of the within-between model may be desirable insome cases, for instance (McNeish, 2019). I wanted to fit asymmetric effectsmodels that allow positive and negative changes in variables to differ (Allison, 2019).I was also able to implement a better method for calculating interactions inwithin-between models (Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran, 2018). Get the details onthese things in the introductory vignette.

In general, `plm` has a lot more stuff. For instance, for fixed effects modelsthere are many different methods for calculating standard errors includedrather painlessly with `plm`. In the mutlilevel modeling framework for`panelr`’s `wbm()` function, the multilevel model inherently deals with thewithin-entity correlation of errors, but you are limited if you would likedifferent kinds of adjustments (GEE estimation offers some more flexibility).`plm` also includes many tests of various model assumptions, like the Hausmantest (which can be replicated on a per-coefficient basis in the within-betweenmodel). `plm` has many tools for including instrumental variables, but `panelr`has none and I don’t foresee any being added in the near future.

Overall, I am not motivated to duplicate features of `plm` *just for the sake offeature parity*. There are some models which are nearly or exactly equivalentacross the two packages, but this is just a happy coincidence. I will expand`panelr` as is prudent, which may sometimes involve duplication of `plm`functionality but only for reasons relating to substantive differences inimplementation. As an example, `panelr` includes the function `are_varying()`that allows the user to assess whether variables vary over time.It is substantively equivalent to `plm`’s `pvar()`, but I was motivated togive users a means for asking for specific variables using a “tidy” selectioninterface. Although I would not generally promise that my packages are highlyperformant, I later realized that `are_varying()` is much faster than `pvar()`,which can be quite noticeable for larger datasets.

This is just to say that there may be cases in which `panelr` does somethingvery similar, and it may sometimes be better or different in a way that youwould prefer. But I generally see `panelr` as a complementary package, filling insome gaps and giving an alternative way to do panel data analysis in R.
