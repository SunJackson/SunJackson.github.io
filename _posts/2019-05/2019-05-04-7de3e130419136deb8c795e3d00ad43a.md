(TL;DR: Scalars are single numbers.)

I have so many scalars! Opie, the open source snake

Lasttime,we covered some basic concepts regarding **`sets`** on our journey tounderstanding **`vectors`** and **`matrices`**.

Let’s do this!

## What’s a scalar?

A scalar is a single number! This seems very simple (and it is). But weneed to know this to understand operations like *scalar multiplication*or statements like *“The result of multiplying `this` by `that` is ascalar”*.

We will use the notation from Goodfellow, Ian, etal. and depict them in lower case,italicised letters like this:


How can we define the types of numbers our scalars should represent?
Say, we define our **arbitrary scalar**, , as a number from the set ofnaturalnumbers.We would show this **set membership** like this:


The ‘’ symbol means**‘is a member/is an element of/belongs to (some set)’** Pick the one you like most!However, the whole statement is often read as ’ is a naturalnumber’.

The symbol ‘’ means**‘is not a member/is not an element of/does not belongs to (some set)’**. Easy!

## Let’s bring this back to machine learning

What are the implications of defining our scalars as natural numbers?Let’s start with an abstract example!

- Let’s say we start with the number , and we want to **`add`**some arbitrary number, , to it.

- Let’s define as a natural number. That is,* belongs to the set of ‘whole’, positive numbers starting with 1 and increasing with no upper bound*.


Here are some of the implications of our definition of:

- cannot equal because , andtherefore, cannot take on the value of .

- We can never get an answer where the first decimal place issomething other than **zero**. For example, there is no naturalnumber, , where .


Now here is my (crappy) attempt at intuitively bringing this back to machinelearning!

- Let’s say that our scalar, , is the value used to **update theparameters in our model** after some iteration of training.

- Then we are restricted to making crude updates of **at least one**only!

- Our algorithm may never converge and we might see the values of ourevaluation metric jumping about erratically as training progresses.


This might not be an academically rigorous explanation, but it’shopefully good enough to build some intuition.

## We’ll define our scalars as real numbers

We’ll make our universe of numbers into something larger where our scalars can take on more than just whole, positive values. We willdefine our arbitrary scalars, , as coming from the set of realnumbers. That is:


How can we represent scalars in R?
R technically has no scalar data type! From Hadley Wickham’s ‘AdvancedR’, 1st edition, we can find thisin the ‘Data Structures’chapter:

> 
Note that R has no 0-dimensional, or scalar types. Individual numbersor strings, which you might think would be scalars, are actuallyvectors of length one.


But in practice, we can emulate our real number scalar by doing something like this:

In the same section, we also find out that to test whether something isa vector in R, one must use `is.atomic()`:

Yes, we have ourselves a vector! How many elements do we have?

Hooray! We have ourselves a proxy for our scalar. Now what is the datatype of our scalar?

From the **`numeric`** help page in the R documentation, we find this:

> 
numeric is identical to double (and real). It creates adouble-precision vector of the specified length with each elementequal to 0.


Then from the **`double`** help page, we find this:

> 
All real numbers are stored in double precision format.


Let’s test it out!

Hooray!

We now know that scalars are members of sets. We have defined our scalarsas coming from the set of real numbers.

On to vectors!
