It has been a long time coming, but my R package`panelr` is now onCRAN. Since I started work on itwell over a year ago, it has become essential to my own workflow and I hopeit can be useful for others.

## `panel_data` object class

One key contribution, that I hope can help other developers, is the creation ofa `panel_data` object class. It is a modified `tibble`, which is itself amodified `data.frame`. `panel_data` frames are grouped by entity, so manyoperations (e.g., `mean()`, `cumsum()`) performed by `dplyr`’s `mutate()`are groupwise operations. The `panel_data` frame also works very hard tostay in sequential order to ensure that lag and lead operations within`mutate()` make sense.

`panel_data` frames are in “long” format, in which each row is a uniquecombination of entity and time point. Let’s run through a quick example. First,the package includes the example “raw’ dataset called `WageData`, which comesfrom the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. This is what it looks like:

```
library(panelr)
data("WageData")
head(WageData)

```

```
 exp wks occ ind south smsa ms fem union ed blk lwage t id
1 3 32 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9 0 5.56068 1 1
2 4 43 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9 0 5.72031 2 1
3 5 40 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9 0 5.99645 3 1
4 6 39 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9 0 5.99645 4 1
5 7 42 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9 0 6.06146 5 1
6 8 35 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9 0 6.17379 6 1

```

The key columns are `id` and `t`. They tell you which respondent and whichtime point the row refers to, respectively. Let’s convert it into a `panel_data`frame.

```
wages <- panel_data(WageData, id = id, wave = t)
wages

```

```
# Panel data: 4,165 x 14
# entities: id [595]
# wave variable: t [1, 2, 3, ... (7 waves)]
 id t exp wks occ ind south smsa ms fem union ed
 
 1 1 1 3 32 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9
 2 1 2 4 43 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9
 3 1 3 5 40 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9
 4 1 4 6 39 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9
 5 1 5 7 42 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9
 6 1 6 8 35 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9
 7 1 7 9 32 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9
 8 2 1 30 34 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 11
 9 2 2 31 27 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 11
10 2 3 32 33 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 11
# ... with 4,155 more rows, and 2 more variables: blk , lwage 

```

`panel_data()` needs to now the ID and wave columns so that it can protect them(and you) against accidentally being dropped, re-ordered, and so on. It alsoallows other panel data functions in the package to know this informationwithout you having to respecify every time.

Note that the `wages` data are grouped by `id` and sorted by `t` within each`id`. That means when you want to do things like calculate group means andcreate lagged variables, everything works correctly. A warning, though: this isonly true within `mutate()` and `transmute()` from the `dplyr` package.

```
library(dplyr)
wages %>% 
 mutate(
 wks_mean = mean(wks), # this is the person-level mean
 wks_lag = lag(wks), # this will have a value of NA when t = 1
 cumu_wages = cumsum(exp(lwage)) # cumulative summation works within person
 ) %>%
 select(wks, wks_mean, wks_lag, lwage, cumu_wages) 

```

```
# Panel data: 4,165 x 7
# entities: id [595]
# wave variable: t [1, 2, 3, ... (7 waves)]
 id t wks wks_mean wks_lag lwage cumu_wages
 
 1 1 1 32 37.6 NA 5.56 260.
 2 1 2 43 37.6 32 5.72 565.
 3 1 3 40 37.6 43 6.00 967.
 4 1 4 39 37.6 40 6.00 1369.
 5 1 5 42 37.6 39 6.06 1798.
 6 1 6 35 37.6 42 6.17 2278.
 7 1 7 32 37.6 35 6.24 2793.
 8 2 1 34 31.6 NA 6.16 475.
 9 2 2 27 31.6 34 6.21 975.
10 2 3 33 31.6 27 6.26 1500.
# ... with 4,155 more rows

```

Notice also that when you use `select`, the `id` and `t` columns ride alongeven though you didn’t explicitly ask for them. The idea here is that itisn’t `panel_data` frame without them. It works the same way using base Rsubsetting:

```
wages["wks"]

```

```
# Panel data: 4,165 x 3
# entities: id [595]
# wave variable: t [1, 2, 3, ... (7 waves)]
 id t wks
 
 1 1 1 32
 2 1 2 43
 3 1 3 40
 4 1 4 39
 5 1 5 42
 6 1 6 35
 7 1 7 32
 8 2 1 34
 9 2 2 27
10 2 3 33
# ... with 4,155 more rows

```

You can get just the one column using double brackets or the `$` subsettingmethod. But note that using base R sub-assignment, you don’t need to sweat thoseextra columns:

```
wages["wage"] <- exp(wages[["lwage"]]) # note double brackets 

```

### Describing panel data

I’m also working on building out some descriptive functionality just forpanel data. `panel_data` objects have a `summary()` method, which works bestwhen you have the `skimr` package installed. By default, it will providedescriptive statistics for each column in each wave. To shorten the output,you can choose columns using `dplyr::select()` style syntax.

```
summary(wages, union, lwage)

```

You can stop getting per-wave statistics by setting `by.wave = FALSE`. Forpanels with many fewer entities, you might also want per-entity statistics. Youcan achieve this by setting `by.wave = FALSE` and `by.id = TRUE`.

You can also visualize trends in your data using `line_plot()`.

```
line_plot(wages, lwage)

```

Each line is an individual `id` in the data.

Let’s see what the mean trendlooks like. While we’re at it, let’s make the individual lines a little moretransparent using the `alpha` argument.

```
line_plot(wages, lwage, add.mean = TRUE, alpha = 0.2)

```

The blue line is the mean trend and we can see that nearly everyone increasesover time.

Sometimes it is useful to isolate specific entities from your data. I’ll usea different example to illustrate. These data come from the Penn World Tableand contain data about countries, their exchange rates, purchasing powerparity, and related data. It is provided by Stata and discussed in its manual.

```
library(haven)
penn <- read_dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/pennxrate.dta")
penn <- panel_data(penn, id = country, wave = year)
penn

```

```
# Panel data: 5,134 x 10
# entities: country [151]
# wave variable: year [1970, 1971, 1972, ... (34 waves)]
 country year xrate ppp id capt realxrate lnrxrate oecd g7
 
 1 AFG 1970 45 10.8 1 34 1 0 0 0
 2 AFG 1971 45 11.2 1 34 0.250 -1.39 0 0
 3 AFG 1972 45 9.58 1 34 0.213 -1.55 0 0
 4 AFG 1973 45 8.94 1 34 0.199 -1.62 0 0
 5 AFG 1974 45 9.52 1 34 0.211 -1.55 0 0
 6 AFG 1975 45 9.12 1 34 0.203 -1.60 0 0
 7 AFG 1976 45 8.97 1 34 0.199 -1.61 0 0
 8 AFG 1977 45 9.33 1 34 0.207 -1.57 0 0
 9 AFG 1978 45 9.44 1 34 0.210 -1.56 0 0
10 AFG 1979 43.7 9.54 1 34 0.218 -1.52 0 0
# ... with 5,124 more rows

```

We’ll look at trends in the real exchange rate with the United States(`realxrate`).

```
line_plot(penn, realxrate)

```

We can also look at each country separately by setting `overlay = FALSE`.Since there are so many, we will want to look at just a subset. I’ll look atmembers of the “G7” countries, minus the USA.

```
line_plot(penn, realxrate, overlay = FALSE, 
 subset.ids = filter(penn, g7 == 1)$country, add.mean = TRUE)

```

We can see some heterogeneity in the trends. You may also want to fit atrend line that isn’t strictly linear, which is doable via the `mean.function`argument.

```
line_plot(penn, realxrate, overlay = FALSE, 
 subset.ids = filter(penn, g7 == 1)$country,
 add.mean = TRUE, mean.function = "loess")

```

### Tools for reshaping data

Although you can get a much more detailed walk-through in the package’stutorial vignette,I also want to mention some tools I created to help peopleget their data *into* the long format demanded by `panel_data()` (and mostmethods of analysis) as well as *out* of long format into a wide format inwhich there is just 1 row per entity.

There are a number of tools that can do this, most notably base R’s `reshape()`function. The problem with `reshape()` is that it can be a real pain to use,especially if you have a lot of time-varying variables and/or they aren’tlabeled in a way congenial to what the function is looking for. The `tidyr`package is also designed to help with problems like these, but I (andapparently manyothers)struggle with the featured `spread()` and `gather()` functions, which in thecase of panel data have a tendency to make the data longer than you actuallywant it unless you’re careful. They are great general tools, but my goal wasto make a specific tool to make life easier in this particular situation.

Going from long to wide format is fairly straightforward. Let’s take our`wages` data. As a reminder, it looks like this:

```
wages

```

```
# Panel data: 4,165 x 15
# entities: id [595]
# wave variable: t [1, 2, 3, ... (7 waves)]
 id t exp wks occ ind south smsa ms fem union ed
 
 1 1 1 3 32 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9

 3 1 3 5 40 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9
 4 1 4 6 39 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 9
 5 1 5 7 42 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9
 6 1 6 8 35 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9
 7 1 7 9 32 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 9
 8 2 1 30 34 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 11
 9 2 2 31 27 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 11
10 2 3 32 33 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 11
# ... with 4,155 more rows, and 3 more variables: blk , lwage ,
# wage 

```

Let’s *widen* it, which will leave us with one row for each `id`.

```
widen_panel(wages)

```

```
# A tibble: 595 x 74
 id fem ed blk exp_1 wks_1 occ_1 ind_1 south_1 smsa_1 ms_1

 9 9 0 16 0 3 50 0 0 1 1 1
10 10 0 16 0 3 49 0 0 1 1 1
# ... with 585 more rows, and 63 more variables: union_1 ,
# lwage_1 , wage_1 , exp_2 , wks_2 , occ_2 ,
# ind_2 , south_2 , smsa_2 , ms_2 , union_2 ,
# lwage_2 , wage_2 , exp_3 , wks_3 , occ_3 ,
# ind_3 , south_3 , smsa_3 , ms_3 , union_3 ,
# lwage_3 , wage_3 , exp_4 , wks_4 , occ_4 ,
# ind_4 , south_4 , smsa_4 , ms_4 , union_4 ,
# lwage_4 , wage_4 , exp_5 , wks_5 , occ_5 ,
# ind_5 , south_5 , smsa_5 , ms_5 , union_5 ,
# lwage_5 , wage_5 , exp_6 , wks_6 , occ_6 ,
# ind_6 , south_6 , smsa_6 , ms_6 , union_6 ,
# lwage_6 , wage_6 , exp_7 , wks_7 , occ_7 ,
# ind_7 , south_7 , smsa_7 , ms_7 , union_7 ,
# lwage_7 , wage_7 

```

Notice that for variables that vary over time, there is now a column for eachwave.

Going from wide to long is a bit more complicated because you need to automatethe process of knowing how many waves there are, which variables change overtime, and how the time-varying variables are labeled to reflect the time ofthe measurement. We’ll use another example dataset from this package, called`teen_poverty`, that starts in the wide format.

```
data("teen_poverty")
teen_poverty

```

```
# A tibble: 1,151 x 28
 id pov1 mother1 spouse1 inschool1 hours1 pov2 mother2 spouse2
 
 1 22 1 0 0 1 21 0 0 0

 3 92 0 0 0 1 30 0 0 0
 4 96 0 0 0 0 19 1 1 0
 5 141 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
 6 161 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
 7 220 0 0 0 1 6 0 0 0
 8 229 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
 9 236 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
10 240 0 0 0 1 18 1 0 0
# ... with 1,141 more rows, and 19 more variables: inschool2 ,
# hours2 , pov3 , mother3 , spouse3 ,
# inschool3 , hours3 , pov4 , mother4 ,
# spouse4 , inschool4 , hours4 , age , black ,
# pov5 , mother5 , spouse5 , inschool5 ,
# hours5 

```

We have some variables that don’t change over time (like whether the respondentis black) and a number that do, like whether the respondent is married(`spouse`).

`long_panel()` needs to know what the waves are called (1, 2, 3, …),where the wave label is in the variable name (beginning or end), and whetherthe label has prefixes or suffixes (e.g., “W1_variable” has a “W” prefix and“_” suffix). In this case, we have no prefix/suffix, the label is at the end,and the labels go from 1 to 5.

```
long_panel(teen_poverty, label_location = "end", periods = 1:5)

```

```
# Panel data: 5,755 x 9
# entities: id [1151]
# wave variable: wave [1, 2, 3, ... (5 waves)]
 id wave age black pov mother spouse inschool hours
 
 1 22 1 16 0 1 0 0 1 21
 2 22 2 16 0 0 0 0 1 15
 3 22 3 16 0 0 0 0 1 3
 4 22 4 16 0 0 0 0 1 0
 5 22 5 16 0 0 0 0 1 0
 6 75 1 17 0 0 0 0 1 8
 7 75 2 17 0 0 0 0 1 0
 8 75 3 17 0 0 0 0 1 0
 9 75 4 17 0 0 0 0 1 4
10 75 5 17 0 1 0 0 1 0
# ... with 5,745 more rows

```

Perfect! As a note, `long_panel()` does fairly well in more complicatedsituations, like when time-varying variables are only measured in some wavesand not others. See thevignette for more details.

## Regression models

The other main contribution of the `panelr` package is that it providesa straightforward way to fit some panel data regression models. These are,by and large, doable via other common packages. The reason for implementingthem in `panelr` is that they typically require some programming that wouldbe difficult for novice and maybe even intermediate R users and even for thebest of us, can be error-prone.

The first and most important of these is what is often called the“within-between” or sometimes “between-within” and “hybrid” model, whichseparates within-entity and between-entity variance. The within-entity portionis equivalent to what econometricians called the “fixed effects” model. Peoplelike these models because they are robust to confounding by individualdifferences. You don’t have to measure income, or personality, or whateverit may be and it is automatically controlled for because each person servesas their own control. Unlike fixed effects models, however, you can stillinclude stable variables if you’re interested in their effects.

And because the models are estimated via multilevel models, you can takeadvantage of the specification flexibility afforded by them with random slopesand so on.

You can learn in more detail what these models are all about in the package’sintroductory vignette.

These models are implemented via the `wbm()` function(***w***ithin-***b***etween ***m***odel). Let’s run through an example withthe `teen_poverty` data. First we’ll transform it to long format like inthe earlier example, then we’ll predict hours worked (`hours`) using indicatorsof whether the respondent’s marital status changed (`spouse`), theybecame a mother (`mother`), or have enrolled in school (`inschool`).

```
teen <- long_panel(teen_poverty, label_location = "end", periods = 1:5)
model <- wbm(hours ~ spouse + mother + inschool, data = teen)
summary(model)

```

```

```

We have within- and between-subject effects here. The within effects can beinterpreted as the effects of *changes* in `spouse`, `mother`, and `inschool`on hours worked. The between effects (which are the individual-level means,hence `imean()`) reflect how the overall level of the variables correspondwith the overall level of hours worked, but don’t tell us much about changein either one.

From the output, we can see the within and between effects are quite similar.Unsurprisingly, starting school corresponds with a substantial decrease inhours worked as does becoming a mother.

What if we want to know about the effect of race? `wbm()` uses a multi-partformula to allow you to explicitly specify stable variables. You separatethe within- and between-entity variables with a bar (`|`). For example:

```
model <- wbm(hours ~ spouse + mother + inschool | black, data = teen)
summary(model)

```

```

There does not seem to be a difference in hours worked between black andnon-black respondents, at least after accounting for these other factors.

You can use a third part of the formula as well, where you can specifycross-level interactions (i.e., within by between interactions) as well asuse the `lme4` syntax for random effects (by default, `(1 | id)` is includedwithout you putting it into the formula). Here’s we will see if the effectof becoming a mother is different for black and non-black respondents.

```
model <- wbm(hours ~ spouse + mother + inschool | black | black * mother, data = teen)
summary(model)

```

Indeed, there seems to be.

There are a number of other things available for regression modeling of paneldata that I will not cover in detail here — see theintroductory vignette for moreinfo. These include detrending variables in the within-between model, estimatingwithin-between models with generalized estimating equations (GEE),first differences models, and asymmetric effects models in which increases anddecreases over time are expected to have different effects.
