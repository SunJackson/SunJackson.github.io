**Semantics Guided Graph Relation Neural Network (SGRN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Scene graph construction / visual relationship detection from an image aims to give a precise structural description of the objects (nodes) and their relationships (edges). The mutual promotion of object detection and relationship detection is important for enhancing their individual performance. In this work, we propose a new framework, called semantics guided graph relation neural network (SGRN), for effective visual relationship detection. First, to boost the object detection accuracy, we introduce a source-target class cognoscitive transformation that transforms the features of the co-occurent objects to the target object domain to refine the visual features. Similarly, source-target cognoscitive transformations are used to refine features of objects from features of relations, and vice versa. Second, to boost the relation detection accuracy, besides the visual features of the paired objects, we embed the class probability of the object and subject separately to provide high level semantic information. In addition, to reduce the search space of relationships, we design a semantics-aware relationship filter to exclude those object pairs that have no relation. We evaluate our approach on the Visual Genome dataset and it achieves the state-of-the-art performance for visual relationship detection. Additionally, Our approach also significantly improves the object detection performance (i.e. 4.2\% in mAP accuracy). … 

**Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A multi-agent system (M.A.S.) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. Multi-agent systems can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include some methodic, functional, procedural approach, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. Although there is considerable overlap, a multi-agent system is not always the same as an agent-based model (ABM). The goal of an ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents (which don’t necessarily need to be ‘intelligent’) obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in solving specific practical or engineering problems. The terminology of ABM tends to be used more often in the sciences, and MAS in engineering and technology. Topics where multi-agent systems research may deliver an appropriate approach include online trading, disaster response, and modelling social structures. … 

**Conditional Predictive Impact (CPI)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose a general test of conditional independence. The conditional predictive impact (CPI) is a provably consistent and unbiased estimator of one or several features’ association with a given outcome, conditional on a (potentially empty) reduced feature set. The measure can be calculated using any supervised learning algorithm and loss function. It relies on no parametric assumptions and applies equally well to continuous and categorical predictors and outcomes. The CPI can be efficiently computed for low- or high-dimensional data without any sparsity constraints. We illustrate PAC-Bayesian convergence rates for the CPI and develop statistical inference procedures for evaluating its magnitude, significance, and precision. These tests aid in feature and model selection, extending traditional frequentist and Bayesian techniques to general supervised learning tasks. The CPI may also be used in conjunction with causal discovery algorithms to identify underlying graph structures for multivariate systems. We test our method in conjunction with various algorithms, including linear regression, neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. Empirical results show that the CPI compares favorably to alternative variable importance measures and other nonparametric tests of conditional independence on a diverse array of real and simulated datasets. Simulations confirm that our inference procedures successfully control Type I error and achieve nominal coverage probability. Our method has been implemented in an R package, cpi, which can be downloaded from https://…/cpi. …
