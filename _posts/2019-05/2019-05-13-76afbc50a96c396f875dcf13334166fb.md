“R is a niche language, but if your work falls within that niche it is a wonderful tool. There are some great packages, cutting edge methods, and a generally enthusiastic and welcoming community. You can also find many of these things in other languages like Python and Java, but I still find myself turning to R when I have a bunch of data I want to explore and just try out a bunch of different things.” Pete Werner ( March 14, 2015 )
