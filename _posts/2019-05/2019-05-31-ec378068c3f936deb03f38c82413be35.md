### Looking for an object in nested environments

The following picture shows an environment space that highlights the connections between package and system environments (child `->` parent relationships) and in particular the use of user-defined environments (`outer_env` and `nested_env`), which are part of the global environment and may be regarded as *nested* environments (within the global environment).

The package includes the obj_find() function that is able to look for objects in the whole workspace **including user-defined environments**, even if they are **nested in other user environments**.

This is an important feature because the R built-in function exists() does *not* look for objects in user-defined environments, but only in system and package environments. The only way to make `exists()` look for objects in user-defined environments is to specify them explicitly –*but this doesn’t help if we don’t know where the object may reside!*

The following example illustrates the above limitations of the `exists()` function, and how such limitations are overcome with the `obj_find()` function.

First we define the necessary environments, including objects `x` and `y`, as shown in the picture:

Now we check whether the objects exist using the `exists()` function:

We clearly see two important limitations of the `exists()` function:– it does *not* check for existence in *user-defined* environments (`y` is not found, but it exists in the `nested_env` environment),– if the object exists, it doesn’t tell us *where* it is found.

Instead, the following calls to the `obj_find()` function tell us the whole picture and is informative about the location of the objects (if existing):

Not only is object `y` found, but object `x` is found in *all* three environments where it is defined, including the user-defined environments `outer_env` and `nested_env`, despite the fact that `nested_env` is *nested* in `outer_env`. The path to reach each object is shown using the `$` notation, which is the symbol used to access the object’s value, as achieved by `outer_env$nested_env$x`.
