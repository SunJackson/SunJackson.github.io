Follow the domain expert leads,Create the features data needs.Choose machine learning algorithms to runRegression, random forests,Neural networks for ultimate fun.

Split the data into train and testFind parameters which work bestEvaluate with AUC, recall, and precisionPresent insights that help with decisions
