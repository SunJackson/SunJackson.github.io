**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
MACD, short for moving average convergence/divergence, is a trading indicator used in technical analysis of stock prices, created by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s. It is supposed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock’s price. The MACD indicator (or ‘oscillator’) is a collection of three time series calculated from historical price data, most often the closing price. These three series are: the MACD series proper, the ‘signal’ or ‘average’ series, and the ‘divergence’ series which is the difference between the two. The MACD series is the difference between a ‘fast’ (short period) exponential moving average (EMA), and a ‘slow’ (longer period) EMA of the price series. The average series is an EMA of the MACD series itself.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Bessels Correction** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In statistics, Bessel’s correction, named after Friedrich Bessel, is the use of n – 1 instead of n in the formula for the sample variance and sample standard deviation, where n is the number of observations in a sample. This corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance, and some (but not all) of the bias in the estimation of the population standard deviation, but often increases the mean squared error in these estimations. …

Orbit is a composable framework for orchestrating change processing, tracking, and synchronization across multiple data sources. Orbit is written in Typescript and distributed on npm through the @orbit organization. Pre-built distributions are provided in several module formats and ES language levels. Orbit is isomorphic – it can be run both in modern browsers as well as in the Node.js runtime. …
