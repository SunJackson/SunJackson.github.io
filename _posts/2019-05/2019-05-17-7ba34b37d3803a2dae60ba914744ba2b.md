Data cubes are a popular way to display multidimensional data. This makes the method suitable for big data. Giving the incredible growth of data it is natural that the method have become increasingly popular. In this article you learn to use R for data cubes.

## Read data cubes pacakages into R

First we will read the packages into the R library:

Next we will build a sample array for the data cube:

Now it is time to create a slice and dice for the data cube:

Now it is time to make apply rollup and drilldown for the data cube

Now lets try to make the data cube into a pivottable: 

This gives us the following pivottable in html:
