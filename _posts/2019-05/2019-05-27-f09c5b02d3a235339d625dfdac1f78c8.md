## The see package

We have recently decided to collaborate around the new **easystats project**, a set of packages designed to make your life easier. This project encompasses several packages, devoted for instance to model access or Bayesian analysis, indices of model performance or visualisation.

***Without further ado, please let us introduce the latest addition to the easyverse; the see package!***

Essentially, `see` is the visualisation companion to other functions and packages in **easystats**. See the **list of functions** here. However, it also includes some nice themes and geoms:

## Get Involved

There is definitely room for improvement, and some new exciting features are already planned. Feel free to let us know how we could further improve this package!

To conclude, note that *easystats* is a new project in active development. Thus, do not hesitate to contact us if **you want to get involved ðŸ™‚**
