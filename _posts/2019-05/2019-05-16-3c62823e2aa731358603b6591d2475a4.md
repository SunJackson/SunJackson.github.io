This blog post will provide an intro to {tvthemes} as well as somelessons learned (codecov, Github badges, creating a hexsticker,`usethis::use_*()`, unit testing for `ggplot2`, etc.) and the futuredirection of the package. What kick-started this idea was my blogpostlooking at simple TV stats on my current favorite TV show, BrooklynNine-Nine. I got a lot of good feedback on the colors I used for thecustom `ggplot2` theme and color palettes so I decided to expand it toother shows that I love!

Suggestions and Pull Requests for palettes/themes are welcome, you canfind the Github repo for the packageHERE!

```
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, tvthemes, extrafont, 
 glue, gapminder, emo, patchwork, cowplot)
loadfonts()

```

## Current list of TV shows

- **Avatar: The Last Airbender**: theme + palettes (Fire Nation, WaterTribe, Earth Kingdom, & Air Nomads)

- **Brooklyn Nine-Nine**: theme + palettes (regular & dark)

- **Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice & Fire**: ‘The Palettes of Ice &Fire’ (currently: Stark, Lannister, Tully, Targaryen, Greyjoy, &Tyrell)

- *More in future releases…*


## Installation

`tvthemes` is currently available only on Github, you can install it by:

```
## install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("Ryo-N7/tvthemes")

```

I hope to have a CRAN version soon!

## Fonts

The difficulty with a lot of the fonts used by TV shows in their logosand other marketing media is that they are made by font foundries andcan be rather expensive (for a regular person like you or me) topurchase. So I endeavored to find **free** fonts to use that weresomewhat similar to the real ones used by the shows from resources like`Google Fonts`. In the documentation you can find the **actual** fontsused by the TV shows if you are so inclined to buy them (some are justmy best guesses though)! In some cases there were fan-made fonts such as“Some Time Later” for Spongebob or “Akbar” for The Simpsons that Iincluded with the package.

Instead of dealing with `extrafont` yourself, I re-purposed the`import_*()` functions from the `hrbrthemes` package so you can importthe included fonts very easily. Do note that you still might need toinstall the fonts directly on your computer from the `.ttf` files foundin `tvthemes/inst/fonts`. When you’re done running the functions andinstalling the `.ttf` files on your computer, load the `extrafont`library and then run `loadfonts()`. If you’re having problems check outthe documentation on `extrafont`’s Githubrepo or onCRAN.

The help files for each function tells you the recommended font names incase you forget!

```
import_simpsons() ## "Akbar" font
import_theLastAirbender() ## "Slayer" font
import_rickAndMorty() ## "Get Schwifty" font
import_roboto_condensed() ## "Roboto Condensed" Google Font import from hrbrthemes
import_titillium_web() ## "Titillium Web" Google Font import from hrbrthemes
import_spongeBob() ## "Some Time Later" font
import_cinzel() ## "Cinzel" font to use with 'The Palettes of Ice & Fire'

## install.packages("extrafont")
library(extrafont)
loadfonts() ## You need to do this at the beginning of a session.

```

## Colors

I gathered the colors/hex codes by looking at images online orre-watching some old episodes and then using various hex code websitesand hex code extraction websites. Most of the color palettes were prettystraightforward as the characters or certain elements of the TV showsnaturally provided some kind of differentiation by color. The colors insome of these palettes may still change from feedback and furtherexperimentation.

You can check out all the colors for each palette by running`scales::show_col(tvthemes:::name_of_palette)`. Some examples below:

```
scales::show_col(tvthemes:::rickAndMorty_palette)

```

## Example Plots

### Brooklyn Nine-Nine

For the most part this theme and palette are unchanged from the originalblog post. I just added a few more colors to both the normal palette(shown below) and the dark palette.

```
mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), 
 col = "black", size = 0.1,
 binwidth = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_brooklyn99() +
 labs(title = "Do you know what it means to 'clap back', Raymond?",
 subtitle = glue::glue("BE- {emo::ji('clap')} -CAUSE {emo::ji('clap')} I {emo::ji('clap')} DO {emo::ji('clap')} !"),
 caption = "Pizza bagels? Pizza rolls? Pizza poppers? Pizzaritos? Pizza pockets?") +
 theme_brooklyn99(title.font = "Titillium Web",
 text.font = "Calibri Light",
 subtitle.size = 14)

```

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-05-16-introducing-tvthemes-package_files/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png?w=456)


### Spongebob Squarepants

I had a lot of fun with this one. The colors are taken from thecharacters and their clothes while I was able to find a fan-made fontthat looks similar to the one used in the transition slides of the show.

```
bobspog_plot <- mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_spongeBob() +
 labs(title = "F is for Fire that burns down the whole town!",
 subtitle = "U is for Uranium... bombs! N is for No survivors when you're-",
 caption = "Plankton, those things aren't what fun is about!") +
 theme_spongeBob(title.font = "Some Time Later",
 text.font = "Some Time Later",
 title.size = 22,
 subtitle.size = 16,
 axis.title.size = 16,
 axis.text.size = 14,
 legend.title.size = 14)

bobspog_plot

```

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-05-16-introducing-tvthemes-package_files/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=456)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-05-16-introducing-tvthemes-package_files/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=456)


In addition I was inspired by `ggpomological::paint_pomological()` andcreated a similar function that allows you to place your plot on top ofa Spongebob-themed background.

```
paintBikiniBottom(plot = bobspog_plot,
 background = "background") ## or "floral"

```

### The Simpsons

Pretty simple one to do and I’m sure many of you have seen otherSimpsons related color palettes around the internet. The blue backgroundand yellow title font for the theme was inspired by NathanCunningham’s cool blog posts on TheSimpsons like this onehere.

```
data <- gapminder::gapminder %>% 
 filter(country %in% c("France", "Germany", "Ireland", "Italy", "Japan", "Norway", "Belarus")) %>% 
 mutate(year = as.Date(paste(year, "-01-01", sep = "", format='%Y-%b-%d')))

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, fill = country)) +
 geom_area(alpha = 0.8) +
 scale_x_date(breaks = data$year, date_labels = "%Y") +
 scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::dollar) +
 scale_fill_simpsons() +
 labs(title = "The Simpsons",
 caption = glue::glue("
 A 'Bake 'em Away, Toys!' Production"),
 x = "Wel-diddly-elcome neighborino!",
 y = "Price of Duff Beer") +
 theme_simpsons(title.font = "Akbar",
 text.font = "Akbar",
 axis.text.size = 8)

```

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-05-16-introducing-tvthemes-package_files/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png?w=456)


### Rick and Morty

The colors from the show make for a pretty good discrete color palettewhile the font is a fan-made creation that tries to emulate co-creatorJustin Roiland’s handwriting that was used on the show.

```
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, fill = cut)) +
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
 scale_fill_rickAndMorty() +
 labs(title = "Dammit Morty, You Know Diamonds Aren't Forever Right?",
 subtitle = "They're blood diamonds, Morty **burp**",
 caption = "Wubbalubbadubdub!") +
 theme_rickAndMorty(title.font = "Get Schwifty",
 text.font = "Get Schwifty",
 title.size = 14)

```

### Game of Thrones: Houses Stark, Lannister, Targaryen

As a fan of the books and medieval heraldry looking around forinspiration for the Great Houses of Westeros was quite fun. I hope toadd others in the future (Martell, Arryn), even smaller houses if they have a great colorscheme, like House Bolton, Dayne, Flint (Widow’s Watch), etc.

```
mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 labs(title = "The winters are hard, but the Starks will endure.",
 subtitle = "We always have...",
 caption = "Winter Is Coming...") +
 scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 scale_fill_stark() +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(text = element_text(family = "Cinzel", size = 14)) -> stark

colstully <- tully_pal()(5)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, fill = cut)) +
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
 scale_fill_manual(values = rev(colstully)) +
 #scale_fill_tully() +
 labs(title = "I've seen wet shits I like better than Walder Frey.",
 subtitle = "Pardon my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.",
 caption = "- The Blackfish") +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(text = element_text(family = "Cinzel", size = 10),
 title = element_text(family = "Cinzel", size = 14)) -> tully

ggplot(gapminder::gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
 geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + 
 scale_x_log10() +
 scale_color_targaryen() +
 labs(title = "I am the blood of the dragon. I must be strong.",
 subtitle = "I must have fire in my eyes when I face them, not tears.",
 caption = "- Fire & Blood.") +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(text = element_text(family = "Cinzel", size = 10),
 title = element_text(family = "Cinzel", size = 14)) -> targaryen

## patchwork together:
stark + tully - targaryen + plot_layout(ncol = 1)

```

### Avatar: The Last Airbender

With four very distinct nations (each based on a certain naturalelement) in the Avatar universe it was very easy to come up with colorpalettes.

```
mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_fireNation() +
 labs(title = "Flameo, Hotman!",
 subtitle = "Fire. Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire.",
 x = "Lion Vultures Owned",
 y = "Agni Kai Participation") +
 theme_theLastAirbender(title.font = "Slayer",
 text.font = "Slayer") -> firenation

airquality %>% 
 mutate(Month = as.factor(Month)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = Day, y = Temp, group = Month, color = Month)) +
 geom_line(size = 1.5) +
 scale_color_airNomads() +
 labs(title = "Let's head to the Eastern Air Temple!",
 subtitle = "Appa, Yip Yip!") +
 theme_theLastAirbender(title.font = "Slayer",
 text.font = "Slayer",
 title.size = 10) -> airnomads

ggplot(gapminder::gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
 geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + 
 scale_x_log10() +
 scale_color_waterTribe() +
 labs(title = "I am thinking maybe we could... do an activity together?",
 subtitle = "... Do an activity?",
 x = "GDP per Otter-Penguins",
 y = "Life Expectancy of Arctic Camels") +
 theme_theLastAirbender(title.font = "Slayer",
 text.font = "Slayer",
 title.size = 8,
 subtitle.size = 8) -> watertribe

mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 scale_fill_earthKingdom() +
 labs(title = "There is no war in Ba Sing Se",
 subtitle = "(Welcome to Lake Laogai)") +
 theme_theLastAirbender(title.font = "Slayer",
 text.font = "Slayer",
 title.size = 14) -> earthkingdom

## plot together:
plot_grid(firenation, airnomads, watertribe, earthkingdom, ncol = 2)

```

### Parks and Recreation

This is probably a more literal interpretation of “Parks and Recreation”rather than any of the colors in the palette/theme representing thecharacters. This one was the one I took the most liberties with and justtried to use colors that felt very outdoorsy and “Parks”-like. The fontused with this theme, “Titillium Web” is similar to the typeface used inthe logo of “Parks and Rec”, “Champion HTF-Heavyweight”.

```
airquality %>% 
 mutate(Month = as.factor(Month)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = Day, y = Temp, group = Month, color = Month)) +
 geom_point(size = 2.5) +
 labs(title = "Calzones are pointless.", subtitle = "They're just pizza that's harder to eat!",
 caption = "No one likes them. Good day, sir.") + 
 scale_color_parksAndRec() + 
 theme_minimal() +
 theme_parksAndRec(text.font = "Titillium Web",
 title.font = "Titillium Web Black",
 legend.font = "Titillium Web") -> parksandrec

mpg %>% 
 ggplot(aes(displ)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
 labs(title = "Parks & Recreation",
 subtitle = "Gotta Spend Money To Make Money!",
 caption = "And I spent... all of my money!") +
 scale_fill_parksAndRec() + 
 theme_minimal() +
 theme_parksAndRec_light(title.font = "Titillium Web Black",
 text.font = "Titillium Web") -> parksandreclight

## plot together:
plot_grid(parksandrec, parksandreclight, ncol = 2)

```

## Lessons Learned & Future Steps

Although this package is mainly just for fun, I still learned quite alot from the experience. I was able to get more practice with `usethis`and `devtools` for package development. Instead of manually creatingpackage files, be it the DESCRIPTION, R scripts, license, etc. the`usethis::use_*()` set of functions creates them for you automaticallyalong with the correct directories and when relevant adds them to`.gitignore` or makes a note of any changes in other relevant files.Below is an example of a really nifty `usethis` function that creates aunit test to run a spell check on all your documentation!

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/JqRQMbt.png?w=350&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/JqRQMbt.png?w=350&ssl=1)


A lot of the best packages I’ve seen have always had the cool andinformative badges at the top of the README. The “Lifecycle” badgesdescribed in detail here arepretty straightforward, it gives the viewer an idea of what stage ofdevelopment the R package is in. The other badges I have on `tvthemes`are the ones for the license (GPL v3) and for codecov. I just used`usethis::use_badge()` but there are alternative ways to produce thebadges such as the badgerpackage by Guangchuang Yu.

On the topic of testing, I create a lot of unit tests for the R packagesthat I help maintain at the NGO I work for but until `tvthemes` I hadnever created tests for `ggplot2` themes and palette objects before.After looking around at other theme/palette packages such asvapoRwave,hrbrthemes, andggpomological I was ableto get a sense for what to test for such as:

```
test_that("theme_brooklyn99 works", {
 thm <- theme_brooklyn99()
 expect_s3_class(thm, "theme")
 expect_equal(thm$text$family, "")
})

test_that("brooklyn99_pal raises warning with number greater than colors available, x > 10", {
 expect_warning(brooklyn99_pal()(11))
})

```

In addition, I used codecov to see the exactpercentage of my code that my tests covers.

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/FMCWSef.png?w=450&ssl=1)


Although all of the actual theme or palette functions are “covered” Icould still add more depth to them. Currently I only have a test thatchecks for one component of the theme, the font family, but I shouldexpand this to include other key components of the particular theme I’mtesting for. For example, the exact color of the `panel.background` for`theme_spongBob()` or the correct default size of the title. I also needto figure out how to write tests for the `import_*()` functions and theadd-background-to-plot `paintBikiniBottom()` function!

The next thing I want to try out is to use thevdiffr package to test the outputtedplots themselves. From the README the steps are as follows:


Add expectations to by including `expect_doppelganger()` in yourtest files.


Run `manage_cases()` to generate the plots which vdiffr will testagainst in the future. This will launch a shiny gadget which willask you to confirm that each plot is correct.


Run `devtools::test()` to execute the tests as normal.


This can be extremely useful for `tvthemes` to check whether theindividual themes and palettes are being applied properly whenever Imake some changes in the code!

Last, but certainly not least, was the hex sticker for my package.Originally I wanted to use a character from one of the TV shows in thelogo but in the end I went with something that wasn’t copyrighted. Also,I didn’t really have the photoshop skills to make it work! What I endedup choosing was using the popular Japanese site,irasutoya, which provides thousands ofdrawings for free use. It’s a great website that provides drawings forany object, person, and situation! After finding the best image (a childwatching cartoons and sitting too close to the TV), I used the`hexSticker` package by Guangchuang Yu to create it in R:

```
## Download image:
download.file("https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kHda-2huAF8/WUdZKshMQkI/AAAAAAABFDM/sXt-PT9dKtYp2Y0Y_OV64TJzs7PvOLZmgCLcBGAs/s800/tv_boy_chikaku.png",
 destfile = paste0(tempdir() , ".png"), mode="wb")
## Create sticker:
hexSticker::sticker(subplot = paste0(tempdir() , ".png"), 
 package = "tvthemes",
 p_size = 14, p_color = "#8B4411", 
 p_x = 1, p_y = 1.65, 
 s_x = 1.0, s_y = 0.95,
 s_width = 0.6, s_height = 0.6, 
 h_fill = "#f5f5dc", h_color = "black",
 filename = "tvthemes_hexsticker.png")

```

Besides adding more themes and palettes the next big step would bereleasing `tvthemes` to CRAN. I was rather confused by the process atfirst but after watching JimHester’s video of prepping`vroom` for a CRAN release, a lot of my hangups were cleared up for me.I definitely recommend it as he carefully guides you through theprocess!

I had a **LOT** of fun creating this package and I hope to continue withit in my free time!

Suggestions and Pull Requests for palettes/themes are most welcome, youcan find the Github repo for the packageHERE!
