[Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) is a useful concept I like to think about. It often comes up when you compare items on multiple dimensions. Say you want to buy a new TV. To simplify it let’s assume you only care about two factors: price and quality. We don’t know what you are willing to pay for quality – but we know that *everything else equals*:

1. The cheaper the better.

1. The higher quality the better.


This means we can rule out some TV’s immediately. If TV number 1 is both cheaper and better quality than TV number 2, then there’s no point buying number 2. Other TV’s we can’t compare because they excel at different things (price and quality). We obtain a [partial ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set). If you keep removing TV’s that are dominated this way you end up with a set of TV’s on the *Pareto frontier*. The really nice thing is we don’t have to worry about what scales we’re using. We also don’t need to know how the consumer’s tradeoff function looks like. All we need to care about is there is a way to rank quality and there’s a way to rank price.

Wikipedia features the typical of definitional math that’s extremely hard to get any intuition from:

*The Pareto frontier, , may be more formally described as follows. Consider a system with function , where is a compact set of feasible decisions in the metric space and is the feasible set of criterion vectors in , such that . We assume that the preferred directions of criteria values are known. A point is preferred to (strictly dominates) another point , written as . The Pareto frontier is thus written as*

This is pretty useless to me. I think it’s much more important to develop a visual intuition for how it works. You can define it in high dimensional spaces but let’s look at a two dimensional space first. So think of it as a list of TV’s and the axes are “quality” and “price”. The only important thing is that one TV *dominates* another TV if it’s better quality *and* better price. That’s pretty intuitive to me. If you remove all the TV’s that are dominated by another TV, you end up with the *Pareto frontier*. These are the TV’s that are the only meaningful choices.

One note about the TV example: lower prices are of course better than higher prices. So you can think of the two factors as (-price, quality) just so that *right* and *up* is always better.

Sometimes Pareto frontiers are drawn like this:

The red dots are the TV’s that are on the *Pareto frontier*. You don’t want to buy a TV that’s not on the Pareto frontier since there’s always another one that’s both higher quality and better price. The lines between the dots are just for illustrative purposes, they are not really a part of the frontier. I actually think this makes a lot more sense to draw it this way:

In this case let’s say Samsung has a TV that’s on the Pareto frontier (one of the red dots) and they are launching a new generation. They can move it up and right (all consumers would prefer that!). This improvement would be *Pareto efficient* or a *Pareto improvement*. They can move it down and left (this would be worse for all customers!). Or they can move it up+left or down+right and depending on the consumer they may or may not like it.

Benchmarks are a good use case for computing the Pareto frontier. Often it’s hard to break it down to a single number. I maintain [benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) for approximate nearest neighbor libraries, where there’s a tradeoff between accuracy and speed. It’s useful to plot all points on a 2D graph:

Another thing I used it for relatively recently was to present the best mortgages to a consumer. Basically there’s only two attributes: *interest rate* and *points/credits*. We actually compute the Pareto frontier for our [rate table](https://better.com/#/quick-rate). In this case smaller numbers are better along both dimensions. This is really just the same thing, just flipping the comparisons.

I don’t really know a whole lot about Pareto efficiency, but here are some notes on the technical aspect of it:

Here are some various mental models I have that involve Pareto efficiency:
