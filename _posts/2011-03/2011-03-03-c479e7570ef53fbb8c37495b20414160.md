A work process team within [P](http://pg.com/.)
needed their employees to adopt a new work process throughout a
multinational and multifunctional organization. We identified a core
group of ambassadors who are optimally positioned in their
organizational social network to spearhead a change movement.



Transforming an established, time-tested business practice to a new,
cost-saving alternative is a daunting task for any
organization. With approximately 3,000 employees in 5 functional
units all over the world, [P's](http://pg.com/.)
packaging team needed a movement to change one of their work
processes. As in most organizations, employees typically resist
change. This resistance can be contagious; those who ignore the
change may influence others to do the same. Ultimately, the success
of a movement hinges on training the right team of people to lead
the charge.



Datascope Analytics, in collaboration
with [Syndio Social](http://syndiosocial.com/.), conducted
a social network survey that measured the network of influence
within [P's](http://pg.com/.) packaging team. Using
the influence network, cutting edge models of social contagion, and
novel optimization techniques, Datascope Analytics identified the
thought leaders and change agents who are simultaneously
well-respected by their peers and optimally positioned in the
influence network to foster a movement. The result was a team of
ambassadors who will spearhead change in the organization.

A LivingReport™ reveals the influence network in
P&G.; The LivingReport's interactivity enables managers to
drill down and quickly find key insights of our analysis.



To communicate project results, Datascope Analytics developed a
custom LivingReportTM that allows managers
at [P](http://pg.com/.) to run "what if" scenarios:
build hypothetical ambassador teams, and evaluate the ability of
those teams to spearhead change. As an additional benefit, the
report enables managers at [P](http://pg.com/.) to
explore the connectivity between their functional and geographical
units, dynamically overlay employee attributes over the underlying
social network, and identify rising star employees.
