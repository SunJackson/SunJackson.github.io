Last year, I became addicted
to Sports Club
Stats, a useful site where results of simulations of hockey
seasons (and other sports) are on display. Especially as the end of
the regular season nears, it becomes a great tool to understand which
teams are likely to make the playoffs, and which teams to root for so that
[my favorite team](http://blackhawks.nhl.com/.) has a
better chance of making the playoffs.



I think that I will probably write a few articles about topics
related to this tool, but I first wanted to point out the aspects
that I find particularly valuable:



The ability to choose the model that sets the odds on the
simulations of the remaining games: “weighted” or
“50/50” (coin-flipping). By switching between the
two methods, you can get a pretty good feel for the variation on
the values given due to the choice of
model. Understanding the sensitivity of the results to the
choice of model is not something that is often explicitly
available in a user-friendly way.


The ability to see how the next couple of days games will effect
the other teams probabilities of making the playoffs. When you
see that the Stars winning will reduce the Blackhawks
probability of advancing by almost 10 percent, it gives you
*even more* reason to root against the Stars.


There is a *huge* amount of detail available on
demand. While it is probably quite overwhelming to someone that
is not willing to spend quite a bit of time understanding it, it
is well-hidden to not be distracting for the more casual user.



My only gripe is that some of the content begs to be presented more
visually and in a more aesthetically pleasing way (note horrendous
yellowish-green highlights). Color scheme jokes
aside, Sports Club
Stats is the most useful hockey analytics tool I've come across
on the web and I hope you come to find it useful too.
