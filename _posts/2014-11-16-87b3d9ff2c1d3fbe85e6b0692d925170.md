Unsupervised learning is the most applicable subfield on machine learning as it does not require any labels in the dataset and world is **itself** is an abundance of dataset. Human beings and their actions are recorded more and more every day(through photographs in Instagram, health data through wearables, internet activity through cookies and so on). Even the part of our lives which are not digital will be recorded in near future thanks to internet of things. In such a diversified and unlabeled dataset, unsupervised learning will become more and more important in the future.

Not only it could be useful for dimensionality reduction in the feature set(like a preprocessing step) but also could be useful as feature extraction method. PCA(Principal Component Analysis) could be one of the most used unsupervised learning algorithm(PCA to unsupervised learning, linear regression equivalent to regression). It could be used both a dimensionality reduction in order to reduce data but also while it compresses(reduces) data, since it tries to capture the variance, it could pick up *interesting* featurse, so could be used as a feature extraction method.
