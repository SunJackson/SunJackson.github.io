Python's `mock` module (`unittest.mock` in Python 3.3 and higher) allows you to
observe parameters passed to functions.

I'm a little slow, so I had to dig around to figure out how to do this.

Let's say you have a class:

Now, let's suppose you are testing the functionality of `ProductionClass`, but
you want to observe the parameters passed to your internal methods but still
invoke those internal methods. I didn't find a lot of examples of this from my
Google searches, so here is the solution using `unittest.mock` (or `mock` from
PyPI if you're on Legacy Python 2.x):

Happy hunting.
