Kumar just sent me the following the other day:


Hi Igor,We recently published our work on the hardware realization of a CS-based MIMO radar in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems. Your readers might be interested in this.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8743424--Regards,Kumar Vijay Mishra













Here is the abstract:

We present a cognitive prototype that demonstrates a colocated, frequency-division-multiplexed, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar which implements both temporal and spatial sub-Nyquist sampling. The signal is sampled and recovered via the Xampling framework. Cognition is due to the fact that the transmitter adapts its signal spectrum by emitting only those subbands that the receiver samples and processes. Real-time experiments demonstrate sub-Nyquist MIMO recovery of target scenes with 87:5% spatio-temporal bandwidth reduction and signal-to-noise-ratio of -10 dB.
