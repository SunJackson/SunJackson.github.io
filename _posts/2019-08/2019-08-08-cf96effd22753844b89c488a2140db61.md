As part of my companies commitment to allow our users access to some of our code – we have created a visual way you can assess your accuracy in a confusion matrix. 

The below was posted on our blog site and shows how to interpret a confusion matrix.

I hope the attached article is useful. Please check out Draper and Dash’s main website for more information about the exciting and innovative way we are using data science with healthcare data.

Signing off! And remember…
