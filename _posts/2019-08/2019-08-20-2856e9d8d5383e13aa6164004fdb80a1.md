**Andy Cotgreave has seen many crimes committed against data, he’s even committed many himself. He has inspired thousands of people with technical advice on how to identify trends in visual analytics and develop their own data-discovery skills. We asked the keynote speaker of Crunch Data Conference about buzzwords and career tips. Keep reading to get a $100 worthy coupon to the conference!**

In 2006, when Andy Cotgreave was just beginning to move into data analytics, he saw the Chart Chooser from Extreme Presentations and fell in love with data visualization. Since then he’s still learning the amazing nuances about the different ways to present data. As he has over 10 years’ experience in data visualization and business intelligence, we were of course curious what he thinks about current buzzwords and breakthroughs he would hope we discussed in five years. Funnily enough, Andy answered the same: 

“Artificial Intelligence. It’s not intelligence, it might never be. The work of AI is at best clever use of algorithms to analyse large amounts of data. It has become a lazy term applied to too many tools and gadgets. The result of this is a high risk of over-promising and under-delivering on potential benefits of this technology.”

While he’s worried that the hype around AI might stifle its development, he’s hopeful to see the emerging need for openness with the technology among scientists. 

“In my own field of data analytics, I’m looking forward to seeing algorithms assist an analyst in their analytical flow. Imagine exploring a dataset and applying models to your data so it can find all the interesting paths for analysis. Imagine preparing a new data source and modelling locates and automates a lot of the data cleaning.”
