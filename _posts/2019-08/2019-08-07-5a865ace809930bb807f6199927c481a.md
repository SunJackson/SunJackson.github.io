This post is kept (literally) minimal to demonstrate how simple is this hack using R (of course could be simple in other languages too). This is also to establish a point that R has got use-cases beyond statistics and data-mining.

### Objective

`rstats` subreddit is one of the popular sources of R-related information / discussion on the internet. We’re trying to extract the top posts of `rstats` subreddit.

### Data Format

Lucky for us, Reddit offers a json file for every subreddit (also post) and we’ll use that here.

```
subreddit url: "https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/"
subreddit json: "https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/.json"
```

### jsonlite @ Action

The package that will help us in this endeavor is `jsonlite` (by **Jeroen Ooms** and Team) for parsing `json` files and feeds. It’s got a sweet function that `fromJSON()` that parses a json file and stores the result in a `list` object. Ultimately, we can find the required information – `title`, `url` of the subreddit in there.

```
library(jsonlite)

reddit <- fromJSON("https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/.json")

(top10 <- reddit$data$children$data[1:10,c("title","url")])
```

```

### 3-lines

- Load the library

- Retrieve and Parse the json file

- Extract the relevant information for the list object


### Summary

This post while is primarily intended to demonstrate the simplicity of R and `jsonlite` for json parsing, it can also be used to automate such a script to email or send notification about top 10 rstats subreddit post at a scheduled interval.
