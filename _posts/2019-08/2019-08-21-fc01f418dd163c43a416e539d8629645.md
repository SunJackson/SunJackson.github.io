**Autoregressive-Model-Based Methods for Online Time Series Prediction with Missing Values: an Experimental Evaluation**

Time series prediction with missing values is an important problem of time series analysis since complete data is usually hard to obtain in many real-world applications. To model the generation of time series, autoregressive (AR) model is a basic and widely used one, which assumes that each observation in the time series is a noisy linear combination of some previous observations along with a constant shift. To tackle the problem of prediction with missing values, a number of methods were proposed based on various data models. For real application scenarios, how do these methods perform over different types of time series with different levels of data missing remains to be investigated. In this paper, we focus on online methods for AR-model-based time series prediction with missing values. We adapted five mainstream methods to fit in such a scenario. We make detailed discussion on each of them by introducing their core ideas about how to estimate the AR coefficients and their different strategies to deal with missing values. We also present algorithmic implementations for better understanding. In order to comprehensively evaluate these methods and do the comparison, we conduct experiments with various configurations of relative parameters over both synthetic and real data. From the experimental results, we derived several noteworthy conclusions and shows that imputation is a simple but reliable strategy to handle missing values in online prediction tasks.

**Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Translation-based Learning**

With the proliferation of social media platforms and e-commerce sites, several cross-domain collaborative filtering strategies have been recently introduced to transfer the knowledge of user preferences across domains. The main challenge of cross-domain recommendation is to weigh and learn users’ different behaviors in multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Domain collaborative filtering model following a Translation-based strategy, namely CDT. In our model, we learn the embedding space with translation vectors and capture high-order feature interactions in users’ multiple preferences across domains. In doing so, we efficiently compute the transitivity between feature latent embeddings, that is if feature pairs have high interaction weights in the latent space, then feature embeddings with no observed interactions across the domains will be closely related as well. We formulate our objective function as a ranking problem in factorization machines and learn the model’s parameters via gradient descent. In addition, to better capture the non-linearity in user preferences across domains we extend the proposed CDT model by using a deep learning strategy, namely DeepCDT. Our experiments on six publicly available cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models, outperforming other state-of-the-art cross-domain strategies.

**Towards Linearization Machine Learning Algorithms**

This paper is about a machine learning approach based on the multilinear projection of an unknown function (or probability distribution) to be estimated towards a linear (or multilinear) dimensional space E’. The proposal transforms the problem of predicting the target of an observation x into a problem of determining a consensus among the k nearest neighbors of x’s image within the dimensional space E’. The algorithms that concretize it allow both regression and binary classification. Implementations carried out using Scala/Spark and assessed on a dozen LIBSVM datasets have demonstrated improvements in prediction accuracies in comparison with other prediction algorithms implemented within Spark MLLib such as multilayer perceptrons, logistic regression classifiers and random forests.

**Toward a Dempster-Shafer theory of concepts**

In this paper, we generalize the basic notions and results of Dempster-Shafer theory from predicates to formal concepts. Results include the representation of conceptual belief functions as inner measures of suitable probability functions, and a Dempster-Shafer rule of combination on belief functions on formal concepts.

**Automatic Compiler Based FPGA Accelerator for CNN Training**

Training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)on embedded platforms to support on-device learning is earning vital importance in recent days. Designing flexible training hard-ware is much more challenging than inference hardware, due to design complexity and large computation/memory requirement. In this work, we present an automatic compiler-based FPGA accelerator with 16-bit fixed-point precision for complete CNNtraining, including Forward Pass (FP), Backward Pass (BP) and Weight Update (WU). We implemented an optimized RTL library to perform training-specific tasks and developed an RTL compiler to automatically generate FPGA-synthesizable RTL based on user-defined constraints. We present a new cyclic weight storage/access scheme for on-chip BRAM and off-chip DRAMto efficiently implement non-transpose and transpose operations during FP and BP phases, respectively. Representative CNNs for CIFAR-10 dataset are implemented and trained on Intel Stratix 10-GX FPGA using proposed hardware architecture, demonstrating up to 479 GOPS performance.

**Analyzing the Fine Structure of Distributions**

One aim of data mining is the identification of interesting structures in data. Basic properties of the empirical distribution, such as skewness and an eventual clipping, i.e., hard limits in value ranges, need to be assessed. Of particular interest is the question, whether the data originates from one process, or contains subsets related to different states of the data producing process. Data visualization tools should deliver a sensitive picture of the univariate probability density distribution (PDF) for each feature. Visualization tools for PDFs are typically kernel density estimates and range from the classical histogram to modern tools like bean or violin plots. Conventional methods have difficulties in visualizing the pdf in case of uniform, multimodal, skewed and clipped data if density estimation parameters remain in a default setting. As a consequence, a new visualization tool called Mirrored Density plot (MD plot) is proposed which is particularly designed to discover interesting structures in continuous features. The MD plot does not require any adjustments of parameters of density estimation which makes the usage compelling for non-experts. The visualization tools are evaluated in comparison to statistical tests for the typical challenges of explorative distribution analysis. The results are presented on bimodal Gaussian and skewed distributions as well as several features with published pdfs. In exploratory data analysis of 12 features describing the quarterly financial statements, when statistical testing becomes a demanding task, only the MD plots can identify the structure of their pdfs. Overall, the MD plot can outperform the methods mentioned above.

**Iterative Update and Unified Representation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**

Multi-agent systems have a wide range of applications in cooperative and competitive tasks. As the number of agents increases, nonstationarity gets more serious in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which brings great difficulties to the learning process. Besides, current mainstream algorithms configure each agent an independent network,so that the memory usage increases linearly with the number of agents which greatly slows down the interaction with the environment. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), this paper proposes an iterative update method (IU) to stabilize the nonstationary environment. Further, we add first-person perspective and represent all agents by only one network which can change agents’ policies from sequential compute to batch compute. Similar to continual lifelong learning, we realize the iterative update method in this unified representative network (IUUR). In this method, iterative update can greatly alleviate the nonstationarity of the environment, unified representation can speed up the interaction with environment and avoid the linear growth of memory usage. Besides, this method does not bother decentralized execution and distributed deployment. Experiments show that compared with MADDPG, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance and saves wall-clock time by a large margin especially with more agents.

**A New Deterministic Technique for Symbolic Regression**

This paper describes a new method for Symbolic Regression that allows to find mathematical expressions from a dataset. This method has a strong mathematical basis. As opposed to other methods such as Genetic Programming, this method is deterministic, and does not involve the creation of a population of initial solutions. Instead of it, a simple expression is being grown until it fits the data. The experiments performed show that the results are as good as other Machine Learning methods, in a very low computational time. Another advantage of this technique is that the complexity of the expressions can be limited, so the system can return mathematical expressions that can be easily analysed by the user, in opposition to other techniques like GSGP.

**Development of Atlas, a flexible data structure framework**

This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs). These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node) and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use of domain specific languages. In this deliverable report, we present Atlas, a new software library that is currently being developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), with the scope of handling data structures required for NWP applications in a flexible and massively parallel way. Atlas provides a versatile framework for the future development of efficient NWP and climate applications on emerging HPC architectures. The applications range from full Earth system models, to specific tools required for post-processing weather forecast products. Atlas provides data structures for building various numerical strategies to solve equations on the sphere or limited area’s on the sphere. These data structures may contain a distribution of points (grid) and, possibly, a composition of elements (mesh), required to implement the numerical operations required. Atlas can also represent a given field within a specific spatial projection. Atlas is capable of mapping fields between different grids as part of pre- and post-processing stages or as part of coupling processes whose respective fields are discretised on different grids or meshes.

**Symmetric Cross Entropy for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels**

Training accurate deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of noisy labels is an important and challenging task. Though a number of approaches have been proposed for learning with noisy labels, many open issues remain. In this paper, we show that DNN learning with Cross Entropy (CE) exhibits overfitting to noisy labels on some classes (‘easy’ classes), but more surprisingly, it also suffers from significant under learning on some other classes (‘hard’ classes). Intuitively, CE requires an extra term to facilitate learning of hard classes, and more importantly, this term should be noise tolerant, so as to avoid overfitting to noisy labels. Inspired by the symmetric KL-divergence, we propose the approach of \textbf{Symmetric cross entropy Learning} (SL), boosting CE symmetrically with a noise robust counterpart Reverse Cross Entropy (RCE). Our proposed SL approach simultaneously addresses both the under learning and overfitting problem of CE in the presence of noisy labels. We provide a theoretical analysis of SL and also empirically show, on a range of benchmark and real-world datasets, that SL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that SL can be easily incorporated into existing methods in order to further enhance their performance.

**CFO: A Framework for Building Production NLP Systems**

This paper introduces a novel orchestration framework, called CFO (COMPUTATION FLOW ORCHESTRATOR), for building, experimenting with, and deploying interactive NLP (Natural Language Processing) and IR (Information Retrieval) systems to production environments. We then demonstrate a question answering system built using this framework which incorporates state-of-the-art BERT based MRC (Machine Reading Comprehension) with IR components to enable end-to-end answer retrieval. Results from the demo system are shown to be high quality in both academic and industry domain specific settings. Finally, we discuss best practices when (pre-)training BERT based MRC models for production systems.

**Online Feature Selection for Activity Recognition using Reinforcement Learning with Multiple Feedback**

Recent advances in both machine learning and Internet-of-Things have attracted attention to automatic Activity Recognition, where users wear a device with sensors and their outputs are mapped to a predefined set of activities. However, few studies have considered the balance between wearable power consumption and activity recognition accuracy. This is particularly important when part of the computational load happens on the wearable device. In this paper, we present a new methodology to perform feature selection on the device based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find the optimum balance between power consumption and accuracy. To accelerate the learning speed, we extend the RL algorithm to address multiple sources of feedback, and use them to tailor the policy in conjunction with estimating the feedback accuracy. We evaluated our system on the SPHERE challenge dataset, a publicly available research dataset. The results show that our proposed method achieves a good trade-off between wearable power consumption and activity recognition accuracy.

**TunaGAN: Interpretable GAN for Smart Editing**

In this paper, we introduce a tunable generative adversary network (TunaGAN) that uses an auxiliary network on top of existing generator networks (Style-GAN) to modify high-resolution face images according to user’s high-level instructions, with good qualitative and quantitative performance. To optimize for feature disentanglement, we also investigate two different latent space that could be traversed for modification. The problem of mode collapse is characterized in detail for model robustness. This work could be easily extended to content-aware image editor based on other GANs and provide insight on mode collapse problems in more general settings.

**CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text**

The recent success of natural language understanding (NLU) systems has been troubled by results highlighting the failure of these models to generalize in a systematic and robust way. In this work, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark suite, named CLUTRR, to clarify some key issues related to the robustness and systematicity of NLU systems. Motivated by classic work on inductive logic programming, CLUTRR requires that an NLU system infer kinship relations between characters in short stories. Successful performance on this task requires both extracting relationships between entities, as well as inferring the logical rules governing these relationships. CLUTRR allows us to precisely measure a model’s ability for systematic generalization by evaluating on held-out combinations of logical rules, and it allows us to evaluate a model’s robustness by adding curated noise facts. Our empirical results highlight a substantial performance gap between state-of-the-art NLU models (e.g., BERT and MAC) and a graph neural network model that works directly with symbolic inputs—with the graph-based model exhibiting both stronger generalization and greater robustness.

**Distributional Negative Sampling for Knowledge Base Completion**

State-of-the-art approaches for Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) exploit deep neural networks trained with both false and true assertions: positive assertions are explicitly taken from the knowledge base, whereas negative ones are generated by random sampling of entities. In this paper, we argue that random sampling is not a good training strategy since it is highly likely to generate a huge number of nonsensical assertions during training, which does not provide relevant training signal to the system. Hence, it slows down the learning process and decreases accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach called Distributional Negative Sampling that generates meaningful negative examples which are highly likely to be false. Our approach achieves a significant improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank values amongst two different KBC algorithms in three standard academic benchmarks.

**On the Adversarial Robustness of Subspace Learning**

In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness of subspace learning problems. Different from the assumptions made in existing work on robust subspace learning where data samples are contaminated by gross sparse outliers or small dense noises, we consider a more powerful adversary who can first observe the data matrix and then intentionally modify the whole data matrix. We first characterize the optimal rank-one attack strategy that maximizes the subspace distance between the subspace learned from the original data matrix and that learned from the modified data matrix. We then generalize the study to the scenario without the rank constraint and characterize the corresponding optimal attack strategy. Our analysis shows that the optimal strategies depend on the singular values of the original data matrix and the adversary’s energy budget. Finally, we provide numerical experiments and practical applications to demonstrate the efficiency of the attack strategies.

**Computing Linear Restrictions of Neural Networks**

A linear restriction of a function is the same function with its domain restricted to points on a given line. This paper addresses the problem of computing a succinct representation for a linear restriction of a piecewise-linear neural network. This primitive, which we call ExactLine, allows us to exactly characterize the result of applying the network to all of the infinitely many points on a line. In particular, ExactLine computes a partitioning of the given input line segment such that the network is affine on each partition. We present an efficient algorithm for computing ExactLine for networks that use ReLU, MaxPool, batch normalization, fully-connected, convolutional, and other layers, along with several applications. First, we show how to exactly determine decision boundaries of an ACAS Xu neural network, providing significantly improved confidence in the results compared to prior work that sampled finitely many points in the input space. Next, we demonstrate how to exactly compute integrated gradients, which are commonly used for neural network attributions, allowing us to show that the prior heuristic-based methods had relative errors of 25-45% and show that a better sampling method can achieve higher accuracy with less computation. Finally, we use ExactLine to empirically falsify the core assumption behind a well-known hypothesis about adversarial examples, and in the process identify interesting properties of adversarially-trained networks.

**A Sensitivity Analysis of Attention-Gated Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification**

Recently, Attention-Gated Convolutional Neural Networks (AGCNNs) perform well on several essential sentence classification tasks and show robust performance in practical applications. However, AGCNNs are required to set many hyperparameters, and it is not known how sensitive the model’s performance changes with them. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the effect of different hyperparameters s of AGCNNs, e.g., the kernel window size and the number of feature maps. Also, we investigate the effect of different combinations of hyperparameters settings on the model’s performance to analyze to what extent different parameters settings contribute to AGCNNs’ performance. Meanwhile, we draw practical advice from a wide range of empirical results. Through the sensitivity analysis experiment, we improve the hyperparameters settings of AGCNNs. Experiments show that our proposals achieve an average of 0.81% and 0.67% improvements on AGCNN-NLReLU-rand and AGCNN-SELU-rand, respectively; and an average of 0.47% and 0.45% improvements on AGCNN-NLReLU-static and AGCNN-SELU-static, respectively.

**EmotionX-IDEA: Emotion BERT — an Affectional Model for Conversation**

In this paper, we investigate the emotion recognition ability of the pre-training language model, namely BERT. By the nature of the framework of BERT, a two-sentence structure, we adapt BERT to continues dialogue emotion prediction tasks, which rely heavily on the sentence-level context-aware understanding. The experiments show that by mapping the continues dialogue into a causal utterance pair, which is constructed by the utterance and the reply utterance, models can better capture the emotions of the reply utterance. The present method has achieved 0.815 and 0.885 micro F1 score in the testing dataset of Friends and EmotionPush, respectively.

**Towards an Integrated Graph Algebra for Graph Pattern Matching with Gremlin (Extended Version)**

Graph data management (also called NoSQL) has revealed beneficial characteristics in terms of flexibility and scalability by differently balancing between query expressivity and schema flexibility. This peculiar advantage has resulted into an unforeseen race of developing new task-specific graph systems, query languages and data models, such as property graphs, key-value, wide column, resource description framework (RDF), etc. Present-day graph query languages are focused towards flexible graph pattern matching (aka sub-graph matching), whereas graph computing frameworks aim towards providing fast parallel (distributed) execution of instructions. The consequence of this rapid growth in the variety of graph-based data management systems has resulted in a lack of standardization. Gremlin, a graph traversal language, and machine provides a common platform for supporting any graph computing system (such as an OLTP graph database or OLAP graph processors). We present a formalization of graph pattern matching for Gremlin queries. We also study, discuss and consolidate various existing graph algebra operators into an integrated graph algebra.

**Improved Techniques for Training Adaptive Deep Networks**

Adaptive inference is a promising technique to improve the computational efficiency of deep models at test time. In contrast to static models which use the same computation graph for all instances, adaptive networks can dynamically adjust their structure conditioned on each input. While existing research on adaptive inference mainly focuses on designing more advanced architectures, this paper investigates how to train such networks more effectively. Specifically, we consider a typical adaptive deep network with multiple intermediate classifiers. We present three techniques to improve its training efficacy from two aspects: 1) a Gradient Equilibrium algorithm to resolve the conflict of learning of different classifiers; 2) an Inline Subnetwork Collaboration approach and a One-for-all Knowledge Distillation algorithm to enhance the collaboration among classifiers. On multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet), we show that the proposed approach consistently leads to further improved efficiency on top of state-of-the-art adaptive deep networks.

**Implicit Deep Learning**

We define a new class of “implicit” deep learning prediction rules that generalize the recursive rules of feedforward neural networks. These models are based on the solution of a fixed-point equation involving a single a vector of hidden features. The new framework greatly simplifies the notation of deep learning, and opens up new possibilities, for example in terms of novel architectures and algorithms, robustness analysis and design, interpretability, sparsity, and network architecture optimization.

**EigenRank by Committee: A Data Subset Selection and Failure Prediction paradigm for Robust Deep Learning based Medical Image Segmentation**

Translation of fully automated deep learning based medical image segmentation technologies to clinical workflows face two main algorithmic challenges. The first, is the collection and archival of large quantities of manually annotated ground truth data for both training and validation. The second is the relative inability of the majority of deep learning based segmentation techniques to alert physicians to a likely segmentation failure. Here we propose a novel algorithm, named `Eigenrank’ which addresses both of these challenges. Eigenrank can select for manual labeling, a subset of medical images from a large database, such that a U-Net trained on this subset is superior to one trained on a randomly selected subset of the same size. Eigenrank can also be used to pick out, cases in a large database, where deep learning segmentation will fail. We present our algorithm, followed by results and a discussion of how Eigenrank exploits the Von Neumann information to perform both data subset selection and failure prediction for medical image segmentation using deep learning.

**Spike-Train Level Backpropagation for Training Deep Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks**

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible than conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs well support spatiotemporal learning and energy-efficient event-driven hardware neuromorphic processors. As an important class of SNNs, recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) possess great computational power. However, the practical application of RSNNs is severely limited by challenges in training. Biologically-inspired unsupervised learning has limited capability in boosting the performance of RSNNs. On the other hand, existing backpropagation (BP) methods suffer from high complexity of unrolling in time, vanishing and exploding gradients, and approximate differentiation of discontinuous spiking activities when applied to RSNNs. To enable supervised training of RSNNs under a well-defined loss function, we present a novel Spike-Train level RSNNs Backpropagation (ST-RSBP) algorithm for training deep RSNNs. The proposed ST-RSBP directly computes the gradient of a rated-coded loss function defined at the output layer of the network w.r.t tunable parameters. The scalability of ST-RSBP is achieved by the proposed spike-train level computation during which temporal effects of the SNN is captured in both the forward and backward pass of BP. Our ST-RSBP algorithm can be broadly applied to RSNNs with a single recurrent layer or deep RSNNs with multiple feed-forward and recurrent layers. Based upon challenging speech and image datasets including TI46, N-TIDIGITS, and Fashion-MNIST, ST-RSBP is able to train RSNNs with an accuracy surpassing that of the current state-of-art SNN BP algorithms and conventional non-spiking deep learning models.

**Towards Better Generalization: BP-SVRG in Training Deep Neural Networks**

Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) is a classical optimization method. Although it is theoretically proved to have better convergence performance than stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the generalization performance of SVRG remains open. In this paper we investigate the effects of some training techniques, mini-batching and learning rate decay, on the generalization performance of SVRG, and verify the generalization performance of Batch-SVRG (B-SVRG). In terms of the relationship between optimization and generalization, we believe that the average norm of gradients on each training sample as well as the norm of average gradient indicate how flat the landscape is and how well the model generalizes. Based on empirical observations of such metrics, we perform a sign switch on B-SVRG and derive a practical algorithm, BatchPlus-SVRG (BP-SVRG), which is numerically shown to enjoy better generalization performance than B-SVRG, even SGD in some scenarios of deep neural networks.

**A New Approach to Determine the Coefficient of Skewness and An Alternative Form of Boxplot**

To solve the problems in measuring coefficient of skewness related to extreme value, irregular distance from the middle point and distance between two consecutive numbers, ‘Rank skewness’ a new measure of the coefficient of skewness has been proposed in this paper. Comparing with other measures of the coefficient of skewness, proposed measure of the coefficient of skewness performs better specially for skewed distribution. An alternative of five point summary boxplot, a four point summary graph has also been proposed which is simpler than the traditional boxplot. It is based on all observation and give better result than the five point summary.

**StreamNet: A DAG System with Streaming Graph Computing**

To achieve high throughput in the POW based blockchain systems, a series of methods has been proposed, and DAG is one of the most active and promising field. We designed and implemented the StreamNet aiming to engineer a scalable and endurable DAG system. When attaching a new block in the DAG, only two tips are selected. One is the ‘parent’ tip whose definition is the same as in Conflux [29], another is using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique by which the definition is the same as IOTA [40]. We infer a pivotal chain along the path of each epoch in the graph, and a total order of the graph could be calculated without a centralized authority. To scale up, we leveraged the graph streaming property, high transaction validation speed will be achieved even if the DAG is growing. To scale out, we designed the ‘direct signal’ gossip protocol to help disseminate block updates in the network, such that message can be passed in the network in a more efficient way. We implemented our system based on IOTA’s reference code (IRI), and ran comprehensive experiments over different size of clusters of multiple network topologies.
