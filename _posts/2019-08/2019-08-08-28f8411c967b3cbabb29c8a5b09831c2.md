### Enter the matrix

The biggest news is undoubtedly the introduction of `facet_matrix()`, a facetthat allows you to create a grid of panels with different data columns in thedifferent rows and columns of the grid. Examples of such arrangements are knownas scatterplot matrices and pairs plots, but these are just a subset of thegeneral approach.

Before we go on I will, in the interest of full disclosure, mention that certaintypes of scatterplot matrices have been possible for a long time. Most powerfulhas perhaps been the `ggpairs()` function in GGallythat provides an API for pairs plots build on top of ggplot2. More low-level andlimited has been the possibility of converting the data to a long format bystacking the columns of interest and using `facet_grid()`. The latter approachrequires that all columns of interest are of the same type and further moves acrucial operation of the visualization out of the visualization API. The formerapproach, while powerful, is a wrapper around ggplot2 rather than an extensionof the API. This means that you are limited to what the wrapper functionprovides thus loosing the flexibility of the ggplot2 API. A plurality of choicesis good though, and I’m certain that there are rooms for all approaches tothrive.

To show off `facet_matrix()` I’ll start with a standard use of scatterplotmatrices, namely plotting multiple components from a PCA analysis against eachother.

Let’s walk through that last piece of code. We construct a standard ggplot using`geom_point()` but we map x and y to `.panel_x` and `.panel_y`. These areplaceholders created by `facet_matrix()`. Lastly we add the `facet_matrix()`specification. At a minimum we’ll need to specify which columns to use. For thatwe can use standard tidyselect syntax as known from e.g. `dplyr::select()` (herewe use `everything()` to select all columns).

Now, the above plot has some obvious shortcomings. The diagonal is prettyuseless for starters, and it is often that these panels are used to plot thedistributions of the individual variables. Using e.g. `geom_density()` won’twork as it always start at 0, thus messing with the y-scale of each row. ggforceprovides two new geoms tailored for the diagonal: `geom_autodensity()` and`geom_autohistogram()` which automatically positions itself inside the panelwithout affecting the y-scale. We’d still need to have this geom only in thediagonal, but `facet_matrix()` provides exactly this sort of control:

```
ggplot(pca_on_stations, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) + 
 geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 16, size = 0.5) + 
 geom_autodensity() +
 facet_matrix(vars(everything()), layer.diag = 2)
```

As the y-scale no longer affects the diagonal we’ll emphasize this by removingthe horizontal grid lines there:

```
ggplot(pca_on_stations, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) + 
 geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 16, size = 0.5) + 
 geom_autodensity() +
 facet_matrix(vars(everything()), layer.diag = 2, grid.y.diag = FALSE)
```

There is still some redundancy left. As the grid is symmetrical the upper andlower triangle shows basically the same (with flipped axes). We could add someinsight by using another geom in one of the areas that showed some summarystatistic instead:

```
ggplot(pca_on_stations, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) + 
 geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 16, size = 0.5) + 
 geom_autodensity() +
 geom_density2d() +
 facet_matrix(vars(everything()), layer.diag = 2, layer.upper = 3, 
 grid.y.diag = FALSE)
```

While we could call this a day and be pretty pleased with ourselves, I’ll needto show the final party trick of `facet_matrix()`. The above example was kind ofeasy because all the variables were continuous. What if we had a mix?

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) + 
 geom_point(shape = 16, size = 0.5) + 
 facet_matrix(vars(fl, displ, hwy))
```

As we can see `facet_matrix()` itself handles the mix of scale types quite well,but `geom_point()` is not that telling when used on a mix of continuous anddiscrete position scales. ggforce handles this by providing a new positionadjustment (`position_auto()`) that jitters the data based on the scale types.For continuous vs discrete it does a sina-like jitter, whereas for discrete vsdiscrete it jitters inside a disc (continuous vs continuous makes no jitter):

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) + 
 geom_point(shape = 16, size = 0.5, position = 'auto') + 
 facet_matrix(vars(fl, displ, hwy))
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-08-a-flurry-of-facets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

`geom_autodensity()` and `geom_autohistogram()` also knows how to handle bothdiscrete and continuous data, so these can be used safely in all circumstances(here also showing that you can of course also map other aesthetics):

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y, fill = drv, colour = drv)) + 
 geom_point(shape = 16, size = 0.5, position = 'auto') + 
 geom_autodensity(alpha = 0.3, colour = NA, position = 'identity') + 
 facet_matrix(vars(fl, displ, hwy), layer.diag = 2)
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-08-08-a-flurry-of-facets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png?w=450&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1)

Lastly, if you need to use a geom that only makes sense with a specificcombination of scales, you can pick these layers directly, though you may end upfiddling a bit to get all the right layers where you want them:

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y, fill = drv, colour = drv)) + 
 geom_point(shape = 16, size = 0.5, position = 'auto') + 
 geom_autodensity(alpha = 0.3, colour = NA, position = 'identity') + 
 geom_smooth(aes(colour = NULL, fill = NULL)) + 
 facet_matrix(vars(fl, displ, hwy), layer.diag = 2, layer.continuous = TRUE,
 layer.mixed = -3, layer.discrete = -3)
```

The last example I’m going to show, is simply that you don’t have to createsymmetric grids. By default `facet_matrix()` sets the column selection to be thesame as the row selection, but you can overwrite that:

```
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = .panel_x, y = .panel_y)) + 
 geom_point(shape = 16, size = 0.5, position = 'auto') + 
 facet_matrix(vars(manufacturer, hwy), vars(drv, cty))
```

As you can hopefully appreciate, `facet_matrix()` is maximally flexible, whilekeeping the API of the standard use cases relatively clean. The lack of aggplot2-like API for plotting different variables against each others in a gridhas been a major annoyance for me, and I’m very pleased with how I finallysolved it—I hope you’ll put it to good use as well.
