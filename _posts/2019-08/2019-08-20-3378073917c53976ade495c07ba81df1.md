• **jcopdl**J.COp DL is a deep Learning package to complement pytorch workflow. It includes pytroch callbacks and metrics.

• **latent-dirichlet-allocation**Latent-dirichlet-allocation

• **TensorKit**

• **TensorKit-plottools**

• **TensorKit-tools**

• **torchtrainer**Focus on building and optimizing pytorch models not on training loops. PyTorch model training made simpler without loosing control. Focus on optimizing your model! Concepts are heavily inspired by the awesome project [torchsample](https://…/torchsample ) and [Keras](https://…/keras ). Further, besides applying Epoch Callbacks it also allows to call Callbacks every time after a specific number of batches passed (iterations) for long epoch durations.

• **TorchVC**Voice Conversion in PyTorch

• **abode**Python Environment and Package Manager

• **dibbo**A framework for Distributed Black-Box Optimization

• **jupyterlab-zenodo**A Jupyter Notebook extension which enables uploading to Zenodo from JupyterLab

• **mlgen**MLGen is a tool which helps you to generate machine learning code with ease. MlGen is a tool which helps you to generate machine learning code with ease. MLGen uses a ‘.mlm’ file format which is a file with YML like syntax. This tool as of now supports keras and tensorflow2.0(not fully supported)

• **naturalselection**An all-purpose pythonic genetic algorithm

• **pyexlatex**Python Extends LaTeX – A High-Level Python API for Creating Latex Documents. This project is aimed at creating LaTeX documents using only Python, without directly writing LaTeX code. Rather than building a direct Python API to LaTeX, this package has its own, simpler API to creating documents.

• **pysimrel**Simulating data from linear model data

• **saattrupdan.darwin**An all-purpose pythonic genetic algorithm

• **som-learn**Self-Organizing Map algorithm.

• **sqlizer**Orchestration service for SQL only ETL workflows. In many cases you can use SQL only for ETL (extract/transform/load) pipelines relying on CTAS (create table as) queries and the builting import/export futures of your RDBMS or data warehouse software (eg. Redshift).

• **textsense**TextSense.ai a Text analytics platform.
