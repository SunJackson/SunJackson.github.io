A new version of the RcppExamples package is now on CRAN.

The RcppExamples package provides a handful of short examples detailing by concrete working examples how to set up basic R data structures in C++. It also provides a simple example for packaging with Rcpp.

This releases brings a number of small fixes, including two from contributed pull requests (extra thanks for those!), and updates the package in a few spots. The NEWS extract follows:

> 
Changes in RcppExamples version 0.1.9 (2019-08-24)


Extended `DateExample` to use more new Rcpp features


Do not print `DataFrame` result twice (Xikun Han in #3)


Missing parenthesis added in man page (Chris Muir in #5)


Rewrote `StringVectorExample` slightly to not run afould the `-Wnoexcept-type` warning for C++17-related name mangling changes


Updated `NAMESPACE` and `RcppExports.cpp` to add registration


Removed the no-longer-needed `#define` for new Datetime vectors




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for the most recent release.
