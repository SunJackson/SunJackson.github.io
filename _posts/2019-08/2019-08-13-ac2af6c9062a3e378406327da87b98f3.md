We will be speaking at the Tuesday, September 3, 2019 BARUG. If you are in the Bay Area, please come see us.

Nina Zumel & John MountPractical Data Science with R

Practical Data Science with R (Zumel and Mount) was one of the first, and most widely-read books on the practice of doing Data Science using R. We have been working hard on an improved and revised 2nd edition of our book (coming out this Fall). The book reflects more experience with data science, teaching, and with R itself. We will talk about what direction we think the R community has been taking, how this affected the book, and what is new in the upcoming edition.
