### 
Transfer Learning as a Tool for Reducing Simulation Bias: Application to Inertial Confinement Fusion




We adapt a technique, known in the machine learning community as transfer learning, to reduce the bias of a
computer simulation using very sparse experimental data. Unlike
the Bayesian calibration, which is commonly used to estimate
the simulation bias, transfer learning involves calculating an
artificial neural network surrogate model of the simulations.
Assuming that the simulation code correctly predicts trends in
the experimental data but it is subject to unknown biases, we
then partially retrain, or transfer learn, the initial surrogate
model to match the experimental data. This process eliminates
the bias while still taking advantage of the physics relations
learned from the simulation. Transfer learning can be easily
adapted to a wide range of problems in science and engineering.
In this paper, we carry out numerical tests to investigate the
applicability of this technique to predict inertial confinement
fusion experiments under new conditions. Using our synthetic
validation data set we demonstrate that an accurate predictive
model can be built by retraining an initial surrogate model with
experimental data volumes so small that they are relevant to
the inertial confinement fusion problem. This opens up new
opportunities for knowledge transfer and building predictive
models in physics. After implementing transfer learning in a
standard neural network, we successfully extended the method
to a more complex, generative adversarial network architecture,
which will be needed for predicting not only scalars but also
diagnostic images in our future work.
