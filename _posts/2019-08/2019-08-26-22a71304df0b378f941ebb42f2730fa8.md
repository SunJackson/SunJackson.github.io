With the art and practice of government policy-making, public work, and citizen participation, many governments adopt information and communication technologies (ICT) as a vehicle to facilitate their relationship with citizens. This participation process is widely known as E-Participation or Electronic Participation. This article focuses on different performance indicators and the relevant tools for each level. Despite the growing scientific and pragmatic significance of e-participation, that area still was not able to grow as it was expected. Our diverse set of knowledge and e-participation policies and its implementation is very limited. This is the key reason why e-participation initiatives in practice often fall short of expectations.
