**SelectNet** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Supervised learning from training data with imbalanced class sizes, a commonly encountered scenario in real applications such as anomaly/fraud detection, has long been considered a significant challenge in machine learning. Motivated by recent progress in curriculum and self-paced learning, we propose to adopt a semi-supervised learning paradigm by training a deep neural network, referred to as SelectNet, to selectively add unlabelled data together with their predicted labels to the training dataset. Unlike existing techniques designed to tackle the difficulty in dealing with class imbalanced training data such as resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and margin-based learning, SelectNet provides an end-to-end approach for learning from important unlabelled data ‘in the wild’ that most likely belong to the under-sampled classes in the training data, thus gradually mitigates the imbalance in the data used for training the classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of SelectNet through extensive numerical experiments on standard datasets in computer vision. …

We introduce a novel apprenticeship learning algorithm to learn an expert’s underlying reward structure in off-policy model-free \emph{batch} settings. Unlike existing methods that require a dynamics model or additional data acquisition for on-policy evaluation, our algorithm requires only the batch data of observed expert behavior. Such settings are common in real-world tasks—health care, finance or industrial processes —where accurate simulators do not exist or data acquisition is costly. To address challenges in batch settings, we introduce Deep Successor Feature Networks(DSFN) that estimate feature expectations in an off-policy setting and a transition-regularized imitation network that produces a near-expert initial policy and an efficient feature representation. Our algorithm achieves superior results in batch settings on both control benchmarks and a vital clinical task of sepsis management in the Intensive Care Unit. … 

**Optimism in the Face of Sensible Value Function (OFVF)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Optimism about the poorly understood states and actions is the main driving force of exploration for many provably-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose optimism in the face of sensible value functions (OFVF)- a novel data-driven Bayesian algorithm to constructing Plausibility sets for MDPs to explore robustly minimizing the worst case exploration cost. The method computes policies with tighter optimistic estimates for exploration by introducing two new ideas. First, it is based on Bayesian posterior distributions rather than distribution-free bounds. Second, OFVF does not construct plausibility sets as simple confidence intervals. Confidence intervals as plausibility sets are a sufficient but not a necessary condition. OFVF uses the structure of the value function to optimize the location and shape of the plausibility set to guarantee upper bounds directly without necessarily enforcing the requirement for the set to be a confidence interval. OFVF proceeds in an episodic manner, where the duration of the episode is fixed and known. Our algorithm is inherently Bayesian and can leverage prior information. Our theoretical analysis shows the robustness of OFVF, and the empirical results demonstrate its practical promise. …

Symbol detection plays an important role in the implementation of digital receivers. In this work, we propose ViterbiNet, which is a data-driven symbol detector that does not require channel state information (CSI). ViterbiNet is obtained by integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the Viterbi algorithm. We identify the specific parts of the Viterbi algorithm that are channel-model-based, and design a DNN to implement only those computations, leaving the rest of the algorithm structure intact. We then propose a meta-learning based approach to train ViterbiNet online based on recent decisions, allowing the receiver to track dynamic channel conditions without requiring new training samples for every coherence block. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that the performance of ViterbiNet, which is ignorant of the CSI, approaches that of the CSI-based Viterbi algorithm, and is capable of tracking time-varying channels without needing instantaneous CSI or additional training data. Moreover, unlike conventional Viterbi detection, ViterbiNet is robust to CSI uncertainty, and it can be reliably implemented in complex channel models with constrained computational burden. More broadly, our results demonstrate the conceptual benefit of designing communication systems to that integrate DNNs into established algorithms. …
