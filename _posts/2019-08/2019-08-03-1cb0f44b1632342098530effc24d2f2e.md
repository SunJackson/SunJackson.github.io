**CAiRE: An End-to-End Empathetic Chatbot**

In this paper, we present an end-to-end empathetic conversation agent CAiRE. Our system adapts TransferTransfo (Wolf et al., 2019) learning approach that fine-tunes a large-scale pre-trained language model with multi-task objectives: response language modeling, response prediction and dialogue emotion detection. We evaluate our model on the recently proposed empathetic-dialogues dataset (Rashkin et al., 2019), the experiment results show that CAiRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on dialogue emotion detection and empathetic response generation.

**On Observability and Monitoring of Distributed Systems: An Industry Interview Study**

Business success of companies heavily depends on the availability and performance of their client applications. Due to modern development paradigms such as DevOps and microservice architectural styles, applications are decoupled into services with complex interactions and dependencies. Although these paradigms enable individual development cycles with reduced delivery times, they cause several challenges to manage the services in distributed systems. One major challenge is to observe and monitor such distributed systems. This paper provides a qualitative study to understand the challenges and good practices in the field of observability and monitoring of distributed systems. In 28 semi-structured interviews with software professionals we discovered increasing complexity and dynamics in that field. Especially observability becomes an essential prerequisite to ensure stable services and further development of client applications. However, the participants mentioned a discrepancy in the awareness regarding the importance of the topic, both from the management as well as from the developer perspective. Besides technical challenges, we identified a strong need for an organizational concept including strategy, roles and responsibilities. Our results support practitioners in developing and implementing systematic observability and monitoring for distributed systems.

**Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Psychiatry: Insights from a Global Physician Survey**

Futurists have predicted that new technologies, embedded with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will lead to substantial job loss in many sectors disrupting many aspects of healthcare. Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Using Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians, we measured the opinions of psychiatrists about the likelihood that future autonomous technology (referred to as AI/ML) would be able to fully replace the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key tasks (e.g. mental status exam, suicidality assessment, treatment planning) carried out in mental health care. Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries. Only 3.8% of respondents felt that AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting (e.g. updating medical records) and synthesizing information to reach a diagnosis were the two tasks where a majority predicted that future AI/ML would replace human doctors. About 1 in 2 doctors believed their jobs could be changed substantially by future AI/ML. However, female and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the possible benefits of AI would outweigh potential risks, versus their male and global counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first global survey to seek the opinions of physicians on the impact of autonomous AI/ML on the future of psychiatry. Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about intelligent technologies which may better help us integrate such tools and reskill doctors, as needed, to enhance mental health care.

**Computing the Value of Data: Towards Applied Data Minimalism**

We present an approach to compute the monetary value of individual data points, in context of an automated decision system. The proposed method enables us to explore and implement a paradigm of data minimalism for large-scale machine learning systems. Data minimalistic implementations enhance scalability, while maintaining or even optimizing a system’s performance. Using two types of recommender systems, we first demonstrate how much data is ineffective in both settings. We then present a general account of computing data value via sensitivity analysis, and how, in theory, individual data points can be priced according to their informational contribution to automated decisions. We further exemplify this method to lab-scale recommender systems and outline further steps towards commercial data-minimalistic applications.

**Integer Programming, Constraint Programming, and Hybrid Decomposition Approaches to Discretizable Distance Geometry Problems**

Given an integer dimension K and a simple, undirected graph G with positive edge weights, the Distance Geometry Problem (DGP) aims to find a realization function mapping each vertex to a coordinate in K-dimensional space such that the distance between pairs of vertex coordinates is equal to the corresponding edge weights in G. The so-called discretization assumptions reduce the search space of the realization to a finite discrete one which can be explored via the branch-and-prune (BP) algorithm. Given a discretization vertex order in G, the BP algorithm constructs a binary tree where the nodes at a layer provide all possible coordinates of the vertex corresponding to that layer. The focus of this paper is finding optimal BP trees for a class of Discretizable DGPs. More specifically, we aim to find a discretization vertex order in G that yields a BP tree with the least number of branches. We propose an integer programming formulation and three constraint programming formulations that all significantly outperform the state-of-the-art cutting plane algorithm for this problem. Moreover, motivated by the difficulty in solving instances with a large and low density input graph, we develop two hybrid decomposition algorithms, strengthened by a set of valid inequalities, which further improve the solvability of the problem.

**Neural Mention Detection**

Mention detection is an important aspect of the annotation task and interpretation process for applications such as coreference resolution. In this work, we propose and compare three neural network-based approaches to mention detection. The first approach is based on the mention detection part of a state-of-the-art coreference resolution system; the second uses ELMo embeddings together with a bidirectional LSTM and a biaffine classifier; the third approach uses the recently introduced BERT model. Our best model (using a biaffine classifier) achieved gains of up to 1.8 percentage points on mention recall when compared with a strong baseline in a HIGH RECALL setting. The same model achieved improvements of up to 5.3 and 6.5 p.p. when compared with the best-reported mention detection F1 on thevCONLL and CRAC data sets respectively in a HIGH F1 setting. We further evaluated our models on coreference resolution by using mentions predicted by our best model in the start-of-the-art coreference systems. The enhanced model achieved absolute improvements of up to 1.7 and 0.7 p.p. when compared with the best pipeline system and the state-of-the-art end-to-end system respectively.

**RNNbow: Visualizing Learning via Backpropagation Gradients in Recurrent Neural Networks**

We present RNNbow, an interactive tool for visualizing the gradient flow during backpropagation training in recurrent neural networks. RNNbow is a web application that displays the relative gradient contributions from Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cells in a neighborhood of an element of a sequence. We describe the calculation of backpropagation through time (BPTT) that keeps track of itemized gradients, or gradient contributions from one element of a sequence to previous elements of a sequence. By visualizing the gradient, as opposed to activations, RNNbow offers insight into how the network is learning. We use it to explore the learning of an RNN that is trained to generate code in the C programming language. We show how it uncovers insights into the vanishing gradient as well as the evolution of training as the RNN works its way through a corpus.
