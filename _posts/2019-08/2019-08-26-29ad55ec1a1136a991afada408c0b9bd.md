Swift 5 has been so much fun to hack on that there’s a new update to macOS R-focused mebubar utility RSwitch available. Along with the app comes a new dedicated RSwitch landing page and a new user’s guide since it has enough features to warrant such documentation. Here’s the new menu

The core changes/additions include:

- a reorganized menu (see above)

- Built-in check for updates


To make RSwitch launch at startup, just add it as a login item to your user in the “Users & Groups” pane of “System Preferences”.![](https://i0.wp.com/rud.is/b/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/users-n-grps.png?resize=467%2C374&ssl=1&is-pending-load=1)

The guide has information on how all the existing and new features work plus provides documentation on the how to install the alternate R versions available at the R for macOS Developer’s Page. There’s also a slightly expanded set of information on how to contribute to RSwitch development.

### FIN

As usual, kick the tyres, file feature requests or bug reports where you’re comfortable, & — if you’re macOS-dev-curious — join in the Swift 5 fun (it really is a pretty fun language).
