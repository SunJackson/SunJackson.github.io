Continuing on the below post, I am going to use a support vector machine (SVM) to predict combined miles per gallon for all 2019 motor vehicles. 

Part 1: Using Decision Trees and Random Forest to Predict MPG for 2019 Vehicles 

Part 2: Using Gradient Boosted Machine to Predict MPG for 2019 Vehicles 

The raw data is located on the EPA government site

The variables/features I am using for the models are: Engine displacement (size), number of cylinders, transmission type, number of gears, air inspired method, regenerative braking type, battery capacity Ah, drivetrain, fuel type, cylinder deactivate, and variable valve.  

There are 1253 vehicles in the dataset (does not include pure electric vehicles) summarized below.

Starting with an untuned base model:

```
set.seed(123)m_svm_untuned <- svm(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ .,data = test)
```

pred_svm_untuned <- predict(m_svm_untuned, test)

yhat <- pred_svm_untunedy <- test$fuel_economy_combinedsvm_stats_untuned <- postResample(yhat, y)


`svm_stats_untunedRMSE Rsquared MAE 2.3296249 0.8324886 1.4964907 `
Similar to the results for the untuned boosted model.  I am going to run a grid search and tune the support vector machine.

```
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(cost = 2^seq(-5,5,1),gamma= 2^seq(-5,5,1) )e <- NULL
```

for(j in 1:nrow(hyper_grid)){set.seed(123)m_svm_untuned <- svm(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ .,data = train,gamma = hyper_grid$gamma[j],cost = hyper_grid$cost[j]) 

pred_svm_untuned <-predict(m_svm_untuned,newdata = test)

yhat <- pred_svm_untunedy <- test$fuel_economy_combinede[j] <- postResample(yhat, y)[1]cat(j, "\n")}

which.min(e) #minimum MSE

The best tuned support vector machine has a cost of 32 and a gamma of .25.

I am going to run this combination:

```
set.seed(123)m_svm_tuned <- svm(formula = fuel_economy_combined ~ .,data = test,gamma = .25,cost = 32,scale=TRUE) 
```

pred_svm_tuned <- predict(m_svm_tuned,test)

yhat<-pred_svm_tuned y<-test$fuel_economy_combinedsvm_stats<-postResample(yhat,y)




```
svm_statsRMSE Rsquared MAE 0.9331948 0.9712492 0.7133039 
```


The tuned support vector machine outperforms the gradient boosted model substantially with a MSE of .87 vs a MSE of 3.25 for the gradient boosted model and a MSE of 3.67 for the random forest.

```
summary(m_svm_tuned)
```

```
sum(abs(res)<=1) / 314[1] 0.8503185  
```

The model is able to predict 85% of vehicles within 1 MPG of EPA estimate. Considering I am not rounding this is a great result.

The model also does a much better job with outliers as none of the models predicted the Hyundai Ioniq well.
