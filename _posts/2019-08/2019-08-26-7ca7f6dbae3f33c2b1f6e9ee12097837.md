**BabyAI** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Allowing humans to interactively train artificial agents to understand language instructions is desirable for both practical and scientific reasons, but given the poor data efficiency of the current learning methods, this goal may require substantial research efforts. Here, we introduce the BabyAI research platform to support investigations towards including humans in the loop for grounded language learning. The BabyAI platform comprises an extensible suite of 19 levels of increasing difficulty. The levels gradually lead the agent towards acquiring a combinatorially rich synthetic language which is a proper subset of English. The platform also provides a heuristic expert agent for the purpose of simulating a human teacher. We report baseline results and estimate the amount of human involvement that would be required to train a neural network-based agent on some of the BabyAI levels. We put forward strong evidence that current deep learning methods are not yet sufficiently sample efficient when it comes to learning a language with compositional properties. … 

**Hierarchical Clustering** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

In data mining, hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:1. Agglomerative: This is a “bottom up” approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.2. Divisive: This is a “top down” approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.In general, the merges and splits are determined in a greedy manner. The results of hierarchical clustering are usually presented in a dendrogram. … 

**Dataflow Matrix Machine (DMM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Dataflow matrix machines generalize neural nets by replacing streams of numbers with streams of vectors (or other kinds of linear streams admitting a notion of linear combination of several streams) and adding a few more changes on top of that, namely arbitrary input and output arities for activation functions, countable-sized networks with finite dynamically changeable active part capable of unbounded growth, and a very expressive self-referential mechanism. While recurrent neural networks are Turing-complete, they form an esoteric programming platform, not conductive for practical general-purpose programming. Dataflow matrix machines are more suitable as a general-purpose programming platform, although it remains to be seen whether this platform can be made fully competitive with more traditional programming platforms currently in use. At the same time, dataflow matrix machines retain the key property of recurrent neural networks: programs are expressed via matrices of real numbers, and continuous changes to those matrices produce arbitrarily small variations in the programs associated with those matrices. Spaces of vector-like elements are of particular importance in this context. In particular, we focus on the vector space $V$ of finite linear combinations of strings, which can be also understood as the vector space of finite prefix trees with numerical leaves, the vector space of ‘mixed rank tensors’, or the vector space of recurrent maps. This space, and a family of spaces of vector-like elements derived from it, are sufficiently expressive to cover all cases of interest we are currently aware of, and allow a compact and streamlined version of dataflow matrix machines based on a single space of vector-like elements and variadic neurons. We call elements of these spaces V-values. Their role in our context is somewhat similar to the role of S-expressions in Lisp. …

In the recent political climate, the topic of news quality has drawn attention both from the public and the academic communities. The growing distrust of traditional news media makes it harder to find a common base of accepted truth. In this work, we design and build MediaRank (www.media-rank.com), a fully automated system to rank over 50,000 online news sources around the world. MediaRank collects and analyzes one million news webpages and two million related tweets everyday. We base our algorithmic analysis on four properties journalists have established to be associated with reporting quality: peer reputation, reporting bias / breadth, bottomline financial pressure, and popularity. Our major contributions of this paper include: (i) Open, interpretable quality rankings for over 50,000 of the world’s major news sources. Our rankings are validated against 35 published news rankings, including French, German, Russian, and Spanish language sources. MediaRank scores correlate positively with 34 of 35 of these expert rankings. (ii) New computational methods for measuring influence and bottomline pressure. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the large-scale news reporting citation graph in-depth. We also propose new ways to measure the aggressiveness of advertisements and identify social bots, establishing a connection between both types of bad behavior. (iii) Analyzing the effect of media source bias and significance. We prove that news sources cite others despite different political views in accord with quality measures. However, in four English-speaking countries (US, UK, Canada, and Australia), the highest ranking sources all disproportionately favor left-wing parties, even when the majority of news sources exhibited conservative slants. …
