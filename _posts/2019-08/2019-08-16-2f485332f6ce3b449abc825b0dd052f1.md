Big news. RStudio recently started certifying trainers in three areas: the tidyverse, Shiny and teaching. To be certified to teach a topic you have to pass the exam for that topic and the teaching exam.

Even ***bigger*** news. Four of your lovely Jumping Rivers trainers are now certified to teach at least one topic! Check out the RStudio certified trainers page to see me (Theo Roe), Rhian Davies, Colin Gillespie and Roman Popat in action! 

P.S. whilst we’ve got you, if you want to learn the tidyverse or shiny see here
