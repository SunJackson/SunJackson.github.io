**DynaNet: Neural Kalman Dynamical Model for Motion Estimation and Prediction**

Dynamical models estimate and predict the temporal evolution of physical systems. State Space Models (SSMs) in particular represent the system dynamics with many desirable properties, such as being able to model uncertainty in both the model and measurements, and optimal (in the Bayesian sense) recursive formulations e.g. the Kalman Filter. However, they require significant domain knowledge to derive the parametric form and considerable hand-tuning to correctly set all the parameters. Data driven techniques e.g. Recurrent Neural Networks have emerged as compelling alternatives to SSMs with wide success across a number of challenging tasks, in part due to their ability to extract relevant features from rich inputs. They however lack interpretability and robustness to unseen conditions. In this work, we present DynaNet, a hybrid deep learning and time-varying state-space model which can be trained end-to-end. Our neural Kalman dynamical model allows us to exploit the relative merits of each approach. We demonstrate state-of-the-art estimation and prediction on a number of physically challenging tasks, including visual odometry, sensor fusion for visual-inertial navigation and pendulum control. In addition we show how DynaNet can indicate failures through investigation of properties such as the rate of innovation (Kalman Gain).

**GAN-Tree: An Incrementally Learned Hierarchical Generative Framework for Multi-Modal Data Distributions**

Despite the remarkable success of generative adversarial networks, their performance seems less impressive for diverse training sets, requiring learning of discontinuous mapping functions. Though multi-mode prior or multi-generator models have been proposed to alleviate this problem, such approaches may fail depending on the empirically chosen initial mode components. In contrast to such bottom-up approaches, we present GAN-Tree, which follows a hierarchical divisive strategy to address such discontinuous multi-modal data. Devoid of any assumption on the number of modes, GAN-Tree utilizes a novel mode-splitting algorithm to effectively split the parent mode to semantically cohesive children modes, facilitating unsupervised clustering. Further, it also enables incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure. As compared to prior approaches, the proposed framework offers a higher degree of flexibility in choosing a large variety of mutually exclusive and exhaustive tree nodes called GAN-Set. Extensive experiments on synthetic and natural image datasets including ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of GAN-Tree against the prior state-of-the-arts.

**Tensor Factorization with Label Information for Fake News Detection**

The buzz over the so-called ‘fake news’ has created concerns about a degenerated media environment and led to the need for technological solutions. As the detection of fake news is increasingly considered a technological problem, it has attracted considerable research. Most of these studies primarily focus on utilizing information extracted from textual news content. In contrast, we focus on detecting fake news solely based on structural information of social networks. We suggest that the underlying network connections of users that share fake news are discriminative enough to support the detection of fake news. Thereupon, we model each post as a network of friendship interactions and represent a collection of posts as a multidimensional tensor. Taking into account the available labeled data, we propose a tensor factorization method which associates the class labels of data samples with their latent representations. Specifically, we combine a classification error term with the standard factorization in a unified optimization process. Results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive against state-of-the-art methods by implementing an arguably simpler approach.

**A Review of Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning**

Deep Reinforcement Learning has made significant progress in multi-agent systems in recent years. In this review article, we have mostly focused on recent papers on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) than the older papers, unless it was necessary. Several ideas and papers are proposed with different notations, and we tried our best to unify them with a single notation and categorize them by their relevance. In particular, we have focused on five common approaches on modeling and solving multi-agent reinforcement learning problems: (I) independent-learners, (II) fully observable critic, (III) value function decomposition, (IV) consensus, (IV) learn to communicate. Moreover, we discuss some new emerging research areas in MARL along with the relevant recent papers. In addition, some of the recent applications of MARL in real world are discussed. Finally, a list of available environments for MARL research are provided and the paper is concluded with proposals on the possible research directions.

**TAPER: Time-Aware Patient EHR Representation**

Effective representation learning of electronic health records is a challenging task and is becoming more important as the availability of such data is becoming pervasive. The data contained in these records are irregular and contain multiple modalities such as notes, and medical codes. They are preempted by medical conditions the patient may have, and are typically jotted down by medical staff. Accompanying codes are notes containing valuable information about patients beyond the structured information contained in EHR and medical codes. We use transformer networks and the recently proposed BERT language model to embed these data streams into a unified vector representation. The presented approach effectively encodes a patient’s visit data into a single distributed representation, which can be used for downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates superior performance and generalization on mortality, readmission and length of stay tasks using the publicly available MIMIC-III ICU dataset.

**Visual and Semantic Prototypes-Jointly Guided CNN for Generalized Zero-shot Learning**

In the process of exploring the world, the curiosity constantly drives humans to cognize new things. \emph{Supposing you are a zoologist, for a presented animal image, you can recognize it immediately if you know its class. Otherwise, you would more likely attempt to cognize it by exploiting the side-information (e.g., semantic information, etc.) you have accumulated.} Inspired by this, this paper decomposes the generalized zero-shot learning (G-ZSL) task into an open set recognition (OSR) task and a zero-shot learning (ZSL) task, where OSR recognizes seen classes (if we have seen (or known) them) and rejects unseen classes (if we have never seen (or known) them before), while ZSL identifies the unseen classes rejected by the former. Simultaneously, without violating OSR’s assumptions (only known class knowledge is available in training), we also first attempt to explore a new generalized open set recognition (G-OSR) by introducing the accumulated side-information from known classes to OSR. For G-ZSL, such a decomposition essentially solves the class overfitting problem with easily misclassifying unseen classes as seen classes. The problem is ubiquitous in most existing G-ZSL methods. On the other hand, for G-OSR, introducing such semantic information of known classes not only improves the recognition performance but also endows OSR with the cognitive ability of unknown classes. Specifically, a visual and semantic prototypes-jointly guided convolutional neural network (VSG-CNN) is proposed to fulfill these two tasks (G-ZSL and G-OSR) in a unified end-to-end learning framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our learning framework.

**Anomaly Detection in High Dimensional Data**

The HDoutliers algorithm is a powerful unsupervised algorithm for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data, with a strong theoretical foundation. However, it suffers from some limitations that significantly hinder its performance level, under certain circumstances. In this article, we propose an algorithm that addresses these limitations. We define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority with a large distance gap. An approach based on extreme value theory is used for the anomalous threshold calculation. Using various synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the wide applicability and usefulness of our algorithm, which we call the stray algorithm. We also demonstrate how this algorithm can assist in detecting anomalies present in other data structures using feature engineering. We show the situations where the stray algorithm outperforms the HDoutliers algorithm both in accuracy and computational time. This framework is implemented in the open source R package stray.

**Bayesian Inference for Latent Chain Graphs**

In this article we consider Bayesian inference for partially observed Andersson-Madigan-Perlman (AMP) Gaussian chain graph (CG) models. Such models are of particular interest in applications such as biological networks and financial time series. The model itself features a variety of constraints which make both prior modeling and computational inference challenging. We develop a framework for the aforementioned challenges, using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method for statistical inference. Our approach is illustrated on both simulated data as well as real case studies from university graduation rates and a pharmacokinetics study.

**Decision making in dynamic and interactive environments based on cognitive hierarchy theory: Formulation, solution, and application to autonomous driving**

In this paper, we describe a framework for autonomous decision making in a dynamic and interactive environment based on cognitive hierarchy theory. We model the interactions between the ego agent and its operating environment as a two-player dynamic game, and integrate cognitive behavioral models, Bayesian inference, and receding-horizon optimal control to define a dynamically-evolving decision strategy for the ego agent. Simulation examples representing autonomous vehicle control in three traffic scenarios where the autonomous ego vehicle interacts with a human-driven vehicle are reported.

**An End-to-End Neighborhood-based Interaction Model forKnowledge-enhanced Recommendation**

This paper studies graph-based recommendation, where an interaction graph is constructed built from historical records and is lever-aged to alleviate data sparsity and cold start problems. We reveal an early summarization problem in existing graph-based models, and propose Neighborhood Interaction (NI) model to capture each neighbor pair (between user-side and item-side) distinctively. NI model is more expressive and can capture more complicated structural patterns behind user-item interactions. To further enrich node connectivity and utilize high-order structural information, we incorporate extra knowledge graphs (KGs) and adopt graph neural networks (GNNs) in NI, called Knowledge-enhanced NeighborhoodInteraction (KNI). Compared with the state-of-the-art recommendation methods,e.g., feature-based, meta path-based, and KG-based models, our KNI achieves superior performance in click-through rate prediction (1.1%-8.4% absolute AUC improvements) and out-performs by a wide margin in top-N recommendation on 4 real-world datasets.

**Near-optimal Robust Bilevel Optimization**

Bilevel optimization studies problems where the optimal response to a second mathematical optimization problem is integrated in the constraints. Such structure arises in a variety of decision-making problems in areas such as market equilibria, policy design or product pricing. We introduce near-optimal robustness for bilevel problems, protecting the upper-level decision-maker from bounded rationality at the lower level and show it is a restriction of the corresponding pessimistic bilevel problem. Essential properties are derived in generic and specific settings. This model finds a corresponding and intuitive interpretation in various situations cast as bilevel optimization problems. We develop a duality-based solution method for cases where the lower level is convex, leveraging the methodology from robust and bilevel literature. The models obtained are tested numerically using different solvers and formulations, showing the successful implementation of the near-optimal bilevel problem.

**Evaluating Tag Recommendations for E-Book Annotation Using a Semantic Similarity Metric**

In this paper, we present our work to support publishers and editors in finding descriptive tags for e-books through tag recommendations. We propose a hybrid tag recommendation system for e-books, which leverages search query terms from Amazon users and e-book metadata, which is assigned by publishers and editors. Our idea is to mimic the vocabulary of users in Amazon, who search for and review e-books, and to combine these search terms with editor tags in a hybrid tag recommendation approach. In total, we evaluate 19 tag recommendation algorithms on the review content of Amazon users, which reflects the readers’ vocabulary. Our results show that we can improve the performance of tag recommender systems for e-books both concerning tag recommendation accuracy, diversity as well as a novel semantic similarity metric, which we also propose in this paper.

**Automatic Fashion Knowledge Extraction from Social Media**

Fashion knowledge plays a pivotal role in helping people in their dressing. In this paper, we present a novel system to automatically harvest fashion knowledge from social media. It unifies three tasks of occasion, person and clothing discovery from multiple modalities of images, texts and metadata. A contextualized fashion concept learning model is applied to leverage the rich contextual information for improving the fashion concept learning performance. At the same time, to counter the label noise within training data, we employ a weak label modeling method to further boost the performance. We build a website to demonstrate the quality of fashion knowledge extracted by our system.

**An Efficient Skyline Computation Framework**

Skyline computation aims at looking for the set of tuples that are not worse than any other tuples in all dimensions from a multidimensional database. In this paper, we present SDI (Skyline on Dimension Index), a dimension indexing conducted general framework to skyline computation. We prove that to determine whether a tuple belongs to the skyline, it is enough to compare this tuple with a bounded subset of skyline tuples in an arbitrary dimensional index, but not with all existing skyline tuples. Base on SDI, we also show that any skyline tuple can be used to stop the whole skyline computation process with outputting the complete set of all skyline tuples. We develop an efficient algorithm SDI-RS that significantly reduces the skyline computation time, of which the space and time complexity can be guaranteed. Our experimental evaluation shows that SDI-RS outperforms the baseline algorithms in general and is especially very efficient on high-dimensional data.

**VISON: An Ontology-Based Approach for Software Visualization Tool Discoverability**

Although many tools have been presented in the research literature of software visualization, there is little evidence of their adoption. To choose a suitable visualization tool, practitioners need to analyze various characteristics of tools such as their supported software concerns and level of maturity. Indeed, some tools can be prototypes for which the lifespan is expected to be short, whereas others can be fairly mature products that are maintained for a longer time. Although such characteristics are often described in papers, we conjecture that practitioners willing to adopt software visualizations require additional support to discover suitable visualization tools. In this paper, we elaborate on our efforts to provide such support. To this end, we systematically analyzed research papers in the literature of software visualization and curated a catalog of 70 available tools that employ various visualization techniques to support the analysis of multiple software concerns. We further encapsulate these characteristics in an ontology. VISON, our software visualization ontology, captures these semantics as concepts and relationships. We report on early results of usage scenarios that demonstrate how the ontology can support (i) developers to find suitable tools for particular development concerns, and (ii) researchers who propose new software visualization tools to identify a baseline tool for a controlled experiment.

**Active Annotation: bootstrapping annotation lexicon and guidelines for supervised NLU learning**

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models are typically trained in a supervised learning framework. In the case of intent classification, the predicted labels are predefined and based on the designed annotation schema while the labelling process is based on a laborious task where annotators manually inspect each utterance and assign the corresponding label. We propose an Active Annotation (AA) approach where we combine an unsupervised learning method in the embedding space, a human-in-the-loop verification process, and linguistic insights to create lexicons that can be open categories and adapted over time. In particular, annotators define the y-label space on-the-fly during the annotation using an iterative process and without the need for prior knowledge about the input data. We evaluate the proposed annotation paradigm in a real use-case NLU scenario. Results show that our Active Annotation paradigm achieves accurate and higher quality training data, with an annotation speed of an order of magnitude higher with respect to the traditional human-only driven baseline annotation methodology.

**Mixture-based Multiple Imputation Models for Clinical Data with a Temporal Dimension**

The problem of missing values in multivariable time series is a key challenge in many applications such as clinical data mining. Although many imputation methods show their effectiveness in many applications, few of them are designed to accommodate clinical multivariable time series. In this work, we propose multiple imputation models that capture both cross-sectional information and temporal correlations. We integrate Gaussian processes with mixture models and introduce individualized mixing weights to handle the variance of predictive confidence of Gaussian process models. The proposed models are compared with several state-of-the-art imputation algorithms on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Experiments show that our best model can provide more accurate imputation than the benchmarks on all of our datasets.

**On the Validity of Self-Attention as Explanation in Transformer Models**

Explainability of deep learning systems is a vital requirement for many applications. However, it is still an unsolved problem. Recent self-attention based models for natural language processing, such as the Transformer or BERT, offer hope of greater explainability by providing attention maps that can be directly inspected. Nevertheless, by just looking at the attention maps one often overlooks that the attention is not over words but over hidden embeddings, which themselves can be mixed representations of multiple embeddings. We investigate to what extent the implicit assumption made in many recent papers – that hidden embeddings at all layers still correspond to the underlying words – is justified. We quantify how much embeddings are mixed based on a gradient based attribution method and find that already after the first layer less than 50% of the embedding is attributed to the underlying word, declining thereafter to a median contribution of 7.5% in the last layer. While throughout the layers the underlying word remains as the one contributing most to the embedding, we argue that attention visualizations are misleading and should be treated with care when explaining the underlying deep learning system.

**Life After Bootstrap: Residual Randomization Inference in Regression Models**

We develop a randomization-based method for inference in regression models. The basis of inference is an invariance assumption on the regression errors, such as invariance to permutations or random signs. To test significance, the randomization method repeatedly calculates a suitable test statistic over transformations of the regression residuals according to the invariant. Inversion of the test can produce confidence intervals. We prove general conditions for asymptotic validity of this residual randomization test and illustrate in many models, including clustered errors with one-way or two-way clustering structure. We also show that finite-sample validity is possible under a suitable construction, and illustrate with an exact test for a case of the Behrens-Fisher problem. The proposed method offers four main advantages over the bootstrap: (1) it addresses the inference problem in a unified way, while bootstrap typically needs to be adapted to the task; (2) it can be more powerful by exploiting a richer and more flexible set of invariances than exchangeability; (3) it does not rely on asymptotic normality; and (4) it can be valid in finite samples. In extensive empirical evaluations, including high dimensional regression and autocorrelated errors, the proposed method performs favorably against many alternatives, including bootstrap variants and asymptotic robust error methods.

**Automatic Model Monitoring for Data Streams**

Detecting concept drift is a well known problem that affects production systems. However, two important issues that are frequently not addressed in the literature are 1) the detection of drift when the labels are not immediately available; and 2) the automatic generation of explanations to identify possible causes for the drift. For example, a fraud detection model in online payments could show a drift due to a hot sale item (with an increase in false positives) or due to a true fraud attack (with an increase in false negatives) before labels are available. In this paper we propose SAMM, an automatic model monitoring system for data streams. SAMM detects concept drift using a time and space efficient unsupervised streaming algorithm and it generates alarm reports with a summary of the events and features that are important to explain it. SAMM was evaluated in five real world fraud detection datasets, each spanning periods up to eight months and totaling more than 22 million online transactions. We evaluated SAMM using human feedback from domain experts, by sending them 100 reports generated by the system. Our results show that SAMM is able to detect anomalous events in a model life cycle that are considered useful by the domain experts. Given these results, SAMM will be rolled out in a next version of Feedzai’s Fraud Detection solution.
