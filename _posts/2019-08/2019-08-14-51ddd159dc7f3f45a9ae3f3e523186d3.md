Planning for a trip to Cornwall, I was churning through some mysteries there, largely picking them at random from the map. I worked my way through this one by hand, copying the puzzle into a text editor and separating the pairs manually before finally transferring it into RStudio and plotting the result. I moved on.

Later, I twigged that this would be an ideal demonstration of several powerful aspects of string manipulation in R, so I returned and wrote a program to do the same.

The puzzle is straightforward: just plot the coordinate pairs and you should see the cache coordinates spelled out in your plot.

I chose to use a regular expression to extract the contents of each pair of parentheses, using the `str_extract_all` function from the `stringr` package. This “regex” approach is powerful but also makes for a daunting read. If you are new to regular expressions, this website can help you understand them a little better. There is also a cheatsheet section to help remind more experienced users. Regular expressions are **definitely** worth the trouble.

I chose to collapse the pairs of numbers into one big vector and make them into a matrix, which I then plotted with a line plot. It’s not tidy because of the lines joining different characters, but it’s legible.

I just noticed that there are spaces in the original text, probably to separate individual characters. Therefore I could have made something even more sophisticated, separating by spaces first and producing a tidier plot. But I’ve solved this puzzle twice now; a third time just for perfection would be overkill.

The bulk of the work in this puzzle is preparing the data, which is similar to many data visualisation or analysis workflows. `stringr` is the main engine of my solution, plucking the pairs from the parentheses, and again splitting them by the separator in order to coerce messy character data into a clean set of numbers that can be plotted. And it’s scalable, unlike the by-hand method I first used. This task involved 156 numbers, but it could just as easily have been 1560, making the manual approach a poor use of solving time.
