**By Zak Jost, Research Scientist at Amazon Web Services**.

Since Ian Goodfellow and team published their paper introducing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014, this unsupervised approach to deep learning has brought about a wave of technical advancements that essentially appear like the development of "AI creativity."

As GANs have already become an important tool to appreciate in a data scientist's repertoire of machine learning skills, the following two videos from Zak Jost will help you begin your exploration into this exciting area of deep learning.

### Introduction to GANs

The first video provides a high-level overview of GANs featuring a simple illustration of the the key aspects of adversarial learning through modeling a coin-flip scenario (10 minutes).



The Math of GANs
The second video is a deeper dive into GANs with a look at the mathematics behind the modelling. Zak first explains the optimization function, then works through its solution that leads to a perfect generative model (12 minutes).
