The AWS DeepRacer League is the world’s first global autonomous racing league, open to anyone. Developers of all skill levels can get hands-on with machine learning in a fun and exciting way, racing for prizes and glory at 21 events globally and online using the AWS DeepRacer console. The Virtual Circuit launched at the end of April, allowing developers to compete from **anywhere** in the world via the console – no car or track required – for a chance to top the leaderboard and score points in one of the six monthly competitions. The top prize is an expenses paid trip to re:Invent to compete in the 2019 Championship Cup finals, but that is not the only prize.

## More chances to win with weekly challenges

The 2019 virtual racing season ends in the last week of October. Between now and then, the AWS DeepRacer League will run weekly challenges, offering more opportunities to win prizes, and compete for a chance to advance to the Championship Cup on an expenses paid trip to re:Invent 2019. Multiple challenges will launch each week providing cash prizes in the form of AWS credits, that will help you to keep rolling your way up the leaderboard as you continue to tune and train your model.

## More detail on each of the challenges

**The Rookie**– Even the best in the league had to start somewhere! To help those brand new to AWS DeepRacer and machine learning, there are going to be rewards for those who make their debut on the leaderboard. When you submit your first model of the week to the virtual leaderboard, you’re in the running for a chance to win prizes, even if the top spot seems out of reach. If you win, you will receive AWS credits to help you build on these new found skills and climb the leaderboard. Anything is possible once you know how, and this could be the boost you need to take that top prize of a trip to re:Invent 2019.

**The Most Improved** – Think the top spot is out of reach and the only way to win? Think again. A personal record is an individual achievement that should be rewarded. This challenge is designed to help developers, new and existing, reach new heights in their machine learning journey. The drivers who improve their lap time the most each week will receive AWS credits to help them continue to train, improve, and win!

**The Quick Sprint challenge** – In this challenge, you have the opportunity to put your machine learning skills to the test and see how quickly you can create your model for success. Those who train a model in the fastest time and complete a successful lap of the track have the chance to win cash prizes!

## New challenges every week

The AWS DeepRacer League will be rolling out new challenges throughout the month of August, including rewards for hitting that next milestone. Time Target 50, is rewarding those who finish a lap closest to 50 seconds.
