The UK’s largest data & analytics conference and exhibition,

**Big Data LDN (London)**, have recently announced Chris Wylie will headline their 2019 keynote programme.

The New Yorker calls him “a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future”. Best known for his role in setting up – and then taking down – the cyberwarfare firm Cambridge Analytica, Chris has been listed in TIME100 Most Influential People in the World, Forbes’ 30 Under 30, Politico’s 50 Most Influential People in Politics and Business Insider’s 100 Coolest People in Tech.

Named as “the millennials’ first great whistleblower,” his revelations exposing the rampant misuse of data rocked Silicon Valley and forced numerous Fortune 500 companies to overhaul cybersecurity and user privacy practices. Congress held its first ever hearings on the impact of social media on democracy and Facebook experienced the largest single-day share value drop in American corporate history – twice.

His evidence also exposed the deep links between the Alt-Right and Russian intelligence networks, leading to major ongoing FBI and NCA investigations in the US and UK.

With his neon hair and brutally honest candour, Chris engages audiences around the world and makes AI understandable, disturbing – and yet somehow compelling. When Chris speaks out about the future of technology, governments around the world take note – he has testified before the United States Congress five times, as well as at the parliaments of the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada.

Splitting his time between London, New York, LA and Stockholm, Chris is currently the Director of Research for Hennes & Mauritz (‘H&M’), the largest global fashion brand. His work on quantifying fashion style with AI systems is already having a major impact on the fashion sector. A recognised expert in cultural trend forecasting, Chris also writes for the youth culture and fashion magazine Dazed and has been featured in Vogue, GQ, Esquire and PAPER.

In a previous life, Chris worked inside the highest levels of the British government and is a graduate of the London School of Economics.

**Chris will be one of over 100 speakers at the free to attend event and will be speaking at Big Data LDN on Thursday 14th November at 3:50pm in the Keynote Theatre.**
