This paper presents a new interactive opinion mining tool that helps users to classify large sets of short texts originated from Web opinion polls, technical forums or Twitter. From a manual multi-label pre-classification of a very limited text subset, a learning algorithm predicts the labels of the remaining texts of the corpus and the texts most likely associated to a selected label. Using a fast matrix factorization, the algorithm is able to handle large corpora and is well-adapted to interactivity by integrating the corrections proposed by the users on the fly. Experimental results on classical datasets of various sizes and feedbacks of users from marketing services of the telecommunication company Orange confirm the quality of the obtained results. …

We present a stable mergesort, called~\ASS, that exploits the existence of monotonic runs for sorting efficiently partially sorted data. We also prove that, although this algorithm is simple to implement, its computational cost, in number of comparisons performed, is optimal up to an additive linear term. …

Robust reinforcement learning aims to produce policies that have strong guarantees even in the face of environments/transition models whose parameters have strong uncertainty. Existing work uses value-based methods and the usual primitive action setting. In this paper, we propose robust methods for learning temporally abstract actions, in the framework of options. We present a Robust Options Policy Iteration (ROPI) algorithm with convergence guarantees, which learns options that are robust to model uncertainty. We utilize ROPI to learn robust options with the Robust Options Deep Q Network (RO-DQN) that solves multiple tasks and mitigates model misspecification due to model uncertainty. We present experimental results which suggest that policy iteration with linear features may have an inherent form of robustness when using coarse feature representations. In addition, we present experimental results which demonstrate that robustness helps policy iteration implemented on top of deep neural networks to generalize over a much broader range of dynamics than non-robust policy iteration. …

Neighbor-based collaborative ranking (NCR) techniques follow three consecutive steps to recommend items to each target user: first they calculate the similarities among users, then they estimate concordance of pairwise preferences to the target user based on the calculated similarities. Finally, they use estimated pairwise preferences to infer the total ranking of items for the target user. This general approach faces some problems as the rank data is usually sparse as users usually have compared only a few pairs of items and consequently, the similarities among users is calculated based on limited information and is not accurate enough for inferring true values of preference concordance and can lead to an invalid ranking of items. This article presents a novel framework, called IteRank, that models the data as a bipartite network containing users and pairwise preferences. It then simultaneously refines users’ similarities and preferences’ concordances using a random walk method on this graph structure. It uses the information in this first step in another network structure for simultaneously adjusting the concordances of preferences and rankings of items. Using this approach, IteRank can overcome some existing problems caused by the sparsity of the data. Experimental results show that IteRank improves the performance of recommendation compared to the state of the art NCR techniques that use the traditional NCR framework for recommendation. …
