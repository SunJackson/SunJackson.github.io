One of the key roles of a data scientist is to extract patterns and insights from raw data. Since much of the world’s government and corporate data is organized in relational databases, it makes sense that data scientists need to know how to work with these database structures. Writing SQL queries to insert, extract, and filter data in databases is a key skill for anyone interested in data analytics or data science.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is based on E. F. Codd’s Relational model and algebra to manage the relational databases. It’s a database query language used to create, insert, query, and manipulate the relational database and used by a large number of applications.

Although it has been around for decades, learning SQL is still a critical skill for modern data scientists because SQL is commonly used in all kinds of relational database software, including MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn about SQL insertion operations in detail. Here is the list of topics that we will learn in this tutorial:

- SQL Insertion

- Inserting records into a database

- Inserting Pandas DataFrames into a database using the insert command

- Inserting Pandas DataFrames into a database using the to_sql() command

- Reading records from a database

- Updating records in a database

## SQL Insertion

SQL Insertion is an essential operation for data workers to understand. Inserting missing data or adding new data is a major part of the data cleaning process on most data science projects.

Insertion is also how most data gets into databases in the first place, so it’s important anytime you’re collecting data, too. When your company gets new data on a customer, for example, chances are than a SQL insert will be how that data gets into your existing customer database.

In fact, whether or not you’re aware of it, data is flowing into databases using SQL inserts all the time! When you fill out a marketing survey, complete a transaction, file a government form online, or do any of thousands of other things, your data is likely being inserted into a database somewhere using SQL.

Let’s dive into how we can actually use SQL to insert data into a database. We can insert data row by row, or add multiple rows at a time.

#### Inserting records into a database

In SQL, we use the `INSERT` command to add records/rows into table data. This command will not modify the actual structure of the table we’re inserting to, it just adds data.

Let’s imagine we have a data table like the one below, which is being used to store some information about a company’s employees.

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-insert-employee-table.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-insert-employee-table.png)


Now, let’s imagine we have new employees we need to put into the system.

This `employee` table could be created using the `CREATE TABLE` command, so we could use that command to create an entirely new table. But it would be very inefficient to create a completely new table every time we want to add data! Instead, let’s use the `INSERT` command to add the new data into our existing table.

Here’s the basic syntax for using `INSERT` in SQL:

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-insert-syntax.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-insert-syntax.png)


We start with the command `INSERT INTO` followed by the name of table into which we’d like to insert data. After the table name, we list the columns of new data we’re inserting column by column, inside parentheses. Then, on the next line, we used the command `VALUES` along with the values we want to insert (in sequence inside parentheses.

So for our `employee` table, if we were adding a new employee named Kabir, our `INSERT` command might look like this:

#### Inserting Records Into a Database From Python

Since we’re often working with our data in Python when doing data science, let’s insert data from Python into a MySQL database. This is a common task that has a variety of applications in data science.

We can send and receive data to a MySQL database by establishing a connection between Python and MySQL. There are various ways to establish this connection; here, we will use `pymysql` for database connectivity.

Here are the broad steps we’ll need to work through to get `pymysql` connected, insert our data, and then extract the data from MySQL:

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-insert-database-process.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-insert-database-process.png)


Let’s walk through this process step by step.

**Step 1:** Import the `pymysql` module.

```
# Import pymysql module
import pymysql

```

**Step 2:** Create connection a to the MySQL database using `pymysql`‘s `connect()` function with the parameters host, user, database name, and password.

(The parameters below are for demonstration purposes only; you’ll need to fill in the specific access details required for the MySQL database you’re accessing.)

```
# Connect to the database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='localhost',
 user='root',
 password='12345',
 db='employee')

```

**Step 3:** Create a cursor using the `cursor()` function. This will allow us to execute the SQL query once we’ve written it.

```
cursor = connection.cursor()

```

**Step 4:** Execute the required SQL query, commit the changes using the `commit()` function, and check the inserted records. Note that we can create a variable called `sql`, assign our query’s syntax to it, and then pass `sql` and the specific data we want to insert as arguments to `cursor.execute()`.

Then, we’ll commit these changes using `commit()`.

```
# Create a new record
sql = "INSERT INTO `employee` (`EmployeeID`, `Ename`, `DeptID`, `Salary`, `Dname`, `Dlocation`) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(sql, (1008,'Kabir',2,5000,'IT','New Delhi'))

# the connection is not autocommited by default. So we must commit to save our changes.
connection.commit()

```

Let’s do a quick check to see if the record we wanted to insert has actually been inserted. We can do this by querying the database for the entire contents of `employee`, and then fetching and printing those results.

```
# Create a new query that selects the entire contents of `employee`
sql = "SELECT * FROM `employee`"
cursor.execute(sql)

# Fetch all the records and use a for loop to print them one line at a time
result = cursor.fetchall()
for i in result:
 print(i)

```

```
(1001, 'John', 2, 4000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1002, 'Anna', 1, 3500, 'HR', 'Mumbai')
(1003, 'James', 1, 2500, 'HR', 'Mumbai')
(1004, 'David', 2, 5000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1005, 'Mark', 2, 3000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1006, 'Steve', 3, 4500, 'Finance', 'Mumbai')
(1007, 'Alice', 3, 3500, 'Finance', 'Mumbai')
(1008, 'Kabir', 2, 5000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')

```

It worked! Above, we can see the new record has been inserted and is now the final row in our MySQL database.

**Step 5:** Now that we’re done, we should close the database connection using `close()` method.

```
# Close the connection
connection.close()

```

Of course, it would be better to write this code in a way that could better handle exceptions and errors. We can do this using `try` to contain the body of our code and `except` to print errors if any arise. Then, we can use`finally` to close the connection once we’re finished, regardless of whether `try` succeeded or failed.

Here’s what that looks like all together:

```
import pymysql


try:
 # Connect to the database
 connection = pymysql.connect(host='localhost',
 user='root',
 password='12345',
 db='employee')


 cursor=connection.cursor()

 # Create a new record
 sql = "INSERT INTO `employee` (`EmployeeID`, `Ename`, `DeptID`, `Salary`, `Dname`, `Dlocation`) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"
 cursor.execute(sql, (1009,'Morgan',1,4000,'HR','Mumbai'))

 # connection is not autocommit by default. So we must commit to save our changes.
 connection.commit()

 # Execute query
 sql = "SELECT * FROM `employee`"
 cursor.execute(sql)
 # Fetch all the records
 result = cursor.fetchall()
 for i in result:
 print(i)

except Error as e:
 print(e) 

finally:
 # close the database connection using close() method. 
 connection.close()

```

```
((1001, 'John', 2, 4000, 'IT', 'New Delhi'), (1002, 'Anna', 1, 3500, 'HR', 'Mumbai'), (1003, 'James', 1, 2500, 'HR', 'Mumbai'), (1004, 'David', 2, 5000, 'IT', 'New Delhi'), (1005, 'Mark', 2, 3000, 'IT', 'New Delhi'), (1006, 'Steve', 3, 4500, 'Finance', 'Mumbai'), (1007, 'Alice', 3, 3500, 'Finance', 'Mumbai'), (1008, 'Kabir', 2, 5000, 'IT', 'New Delhi'), (1009, 'Morgan', 1, 4000, 'HR', 'Mumbai'), (1009, 'Morgan', 1, 4000, 'HR', 'Mumbai'))

```

## Inserting Pandas DataFrames Into Databases Using `INSERT`

When working with data in Python, we’re often using `pandas`, and we’ve often got our data stored as a pandas DataFrame. Thankfully, we don’t need to do any conversions if we want to use SQL with our DataFrames; we can directly insert a pandas DataFrame into a MySQL database using `INSERT`.

Once again, we’ll take it step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Create DataFrame using a dictionary. We could also import data from a CSV or create a DataFrame in any number of other ways, but for the purposes of this example, we’re just going to create a small DataFrame that saves the titles and prices of some data science texbooks.

```
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame({
 'book_id':[12345, 12346, 12347],
 'title':['Python Programming', 'Learn MySQL', 'Data Science Cookbook'],
 'price':[29, 23, 27]
})

data

```

||book_id|title|price
|------
|0|12345|Python Programming|29|
|1|12346|Learn MySQL|23|
|2|12347|Data Science Cookbook|27|

**Step 2:** Create a table in our MySQL database.

Before inserting data into MySQL, we’re going to to create a `book` table in `MySQL` to hold our data. If such a table already existed, we could skip this step.

We’ll use a `CREATE TABLE` statement to create our table, follow that with our table name (in this case, `book_details`), and then list each column and its corresponding datatype.

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/create-table-sql.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/create-table-sql.png)


**Step 3:** Once we’ve created that table, we can once again create a connection to the database from Python using `pymysql`.

```
import pymysql


# Connect to the database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='localhost',
 user='root',
 password='12345',
 db='book')


# create cursor 
cursor=connection.cursor()

```

**Step 4:** Next, we’ll create a column list and insert our dataframe rows one by one into the database by iterating through each row and using `INSERT INTO` to insert that row’s values into the database.

(It is also possible to insert the entire DataFrame at once, and we’ll look at a way of doing that in the next section, but first let’s look at how to do it row-by-row).

```
# creating column list for insertion
cols = "`,`".join([str(i) for i in data.columns.tolist()])

# Insert DataFrame recrds one by one. 
for i,row in data.iterrows():
 sql = "INSERT INTO `book_details` (`" +cols + "`) VALUES (" + "%s,"*(len(row)-1) + "%s)"
 cursor.execute(sql, tuple(row))

 # the connection is not autocommitted by default, so we must commit to save our changes
 connection.commit() 

```

**Step 5:** Again, let’s query the database to make sure that our inserted data has been saved correctly.

```
# Execute query
sql = "SELECT * FROM `book_details`"
cursor.execute(sql)

# Fetch all the records
result = cursor.fetchall()
for i in result:
 print(i)

```

```
(12345, 'Python Programming', 29)
(12346, 'Learn MySQL', 23)
(12347, 'Data Science Cookbook', 27)

```

Once we’re satisfied that everything looks right, we can close the connection.

```
connection.close()

```

## Inserting Pandas DataFrames into a Database Using the `to_sql()` Function

Now let’s try to do the same thing — insert a pandas DataFrame into a MySQL database — using a different technique. This time, we’ll use the module `sqlalchemy` to create our connection and the `to_sql()` function to insert our data.

This approach accomplishes the same end result in a more direct way, and allows us to add a whole dataframe to a MySQL database all at once.

```
# Import modules
import pandas as pd

# Create dataframe
data=pd.DataFrame({
 'book_id':[12345,12346,12347],
 'title':['Python Programming','Learn MySQL','Data Science Cookbook'],
 'price':[29,23,27]
})

data

```

||book_id|title|price
|------
|0|12345|Python Programming|29|
|1|12346|Learn MySQL|23|
|2|12347|Data Science Cookbook|27|

Import the module `sqlalchemy` and create an engine with the parameters user, password, and database name. This is how we connect and log in to the MySQL database.

```
# import the module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# create sqlalchemy engine
engine = create_engine("mysql+pymysql://{user}:{pw}@localhost/{db}"
 .format(user="root",
 pw="12345",
 db="employee"))

```

Once we’re connected, we can export the whole DataFrame to MySQL using the `to_sql()` function with the parameters table name, engine name, if_exists, and chunksize.

We’ll take a closer look at what each of these parameters refers to in a moment, but first, take a look at how much simpler it is to insert a pandas DataFrame into a MySQL database using this method. We can do it with just a single line of code:

```
# Insert whole DataFrame into MySQL
data.to_sql('book_details', con = engine, if_exists = 'append', chunksize = 1000)

```

Now let’s take a closer look at what each of these parameters is doing in our code.

- `book_details` is the name of table into which we want to insert our DataFrame.

- `con = engine` provides the connection details (recall that we created `engine` using our authentication details in the previous step).

- `if_exists = 'append'`checks whether the table we specified already exists or not, and then appends the new data (if it does exist) or creates a new table (if it doesn’t).

- `chunksize` writes records in batches of a given size at a time. By default, all rows will be written at once.


## Reading Records from a Database

Once we’ve used SQL inserts to get our data into the database, we’ll want to be able to read it back! So far in this tutorial, we’ve checked our SQL inserts by simply printing the entire database, but obviously this is not a viable option with larger databases where you’d be printing thousands of rows (or more). So let’s take a more in-depth look at how we can read back the records we’ve created or inserted into our SQL database.

We can read records from a SQL database using the `SELECT` command. We can select specific columns, or use `*` to select everything from a given table. We can also select to return only records that meet a particular condition using the `WHERE` command.

Here’s how the syntax for these commands looks:

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/reading-records-sql.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/reading-records-sql.png)


We start with a `SELECT`clause, followed by list of columns, or `*` if we want to select all columns.Then we’ll use a `FROM` clause to name the table we’d like to look at. `WHERE` can be used to filter the records and followed by a filter condition, and we can also use `ORDER BY` to sort the records. (The `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses are optional).

With larger databases, `WHERE` is useful for returing only the data we want to see. So if, for example, we’ve just inserted some new data about a particular department, we could use `WHERE` to specify the department ID in our query, and it would return only the records with a department ID that matches the one we specified.

Compare, for example, the results of these two queries using our `employee` table from earlier. In the first, we’re returning all the rows. In the second, we’re getting back only the rows we’ve asked for. This may not make a big difference when our table has seven rows, but when you’re working with seven *thousand* rows, or even seven *million*, using `WHERE` to return only the results you want is very important!

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-reading-records-4.png)


If we want to do this from within Python, we can use the same script we used earlier in this tutorial to query these records. The only difference is that we’ll tell `pymysql` to execute the `SELECT` command rather than the `INSERT` command we used earlier.

```
# Import module
import pymysql

# create connection
connection = pymysql.connect(host='localhost',
 user='root',
 password='12345',
 db='employee')

# Create cursor
my_cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute Query
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * from employee")

# Fetch the records
result = my_cursor.fetchall()

for i in result:
 print(i)

# Close the connection
connection.close()

```

```
(1001, 'John', 2, 4000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1002, 'Anna', 1, 3500, 'HR', 'Mumbai')
(1003, 'James', 1, 2500, 'HR', 'Mumbai')
(1004, 'David', 2, 5000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1005, 'Mark', 2, 3000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1006, 'Steve', 3, 4500, 'Finance', 'Mumbai')
(1007, 'Alice', 3, 3500, 'Finance', 'Mumbai')
(1008, 'Kabir', 2, 5000, 'IT', 'New Delhi')
(1009, 'Morgan', 1, 4000, 'HR', 'Mumbai')
(1009, 'Morgan', 1, 4000, 'HR', 'Mumbai')

```

Above, we’ve selected and printed the entire database, but if we wanted to use `WHERE` to make a more careful, limited selection, the approach is the same:

```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employee WHERE DeptID=2")

```

## Updating Records in the Database

Often, we’ll need to modify the records in the table after creating them.

For example, imagine that an employee in our employee table got a promotion. We’d want to update their salary data. The `INSERT INTO` command won’t help us here, because we don’t want to add an entirely new row.

To modify existing records in the table, we need to use the `UPDATE` command. `UPDATE` is used to change the contents of existing records. We can specify specific columns and values to change using `SET`, and we can also make conditional changes with `WHERE` to apply those changes only to rows that meet that condition.

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-update-table-1.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-update-table-1.png)


Now, let’s update the records from our employee table and display the results. In this case, let’s say David got the promotion — we’ll write a query using `UPDATE` that sets `Salary` to `6000` only in columns where the employee ID is 1004 (David’s ID).

Be careful — without the `WHERE` clause, this query would update every record in the table, so don’t forget that!

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-update-table-2.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-update-table-2.png)


![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-update-table-3.png)
![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sql-update-table-3.png)


After executing the above query, the updated table would look like this:
