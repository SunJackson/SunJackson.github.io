I was recently working on a supervised learning problem (i.e. building a model using some features to predict some response variable) with a fairly large dataset. I used base R’s `plot` and `hist` functions for exploratory data analysis and all looked well. However, when I started building my models, I began to run into errors. For example, when trying to fit the lasso using the `glmnet` package, I encountered this error:

I thought this error message was rather cryptic. However, after some debugging, I realized the error was exactly what it said it was: there were NA/NaN/Inf values in my data matrix! ***The problem was that I had expected these problematic values to have been flagged during my exploratory data analysis.*** However, R’s `plot` and `hist` functions **silently** drop these values before giving a plot.

Here’s some code to demonstrate the issue. Let’s create some fake data with NA/NaN/Inf values:

The two lines of code give plots in return, **without** any warning message to the console that data points have been dropped:

The `ggplot2` package does a better job of handling such values. While it also makes the plot, it sends a warning to the console that some values have been dropped in the process:

**Moral(s) of the story:**

1. Don’t assume that your data is free of NA/NaN/Inf values. Check!

1. Base R’s `hist` and `plot` functions do not warn about invalid values being removed. Either follow the advice in the previous point or use code that flags such removals (e.g. `ggplot2`).
