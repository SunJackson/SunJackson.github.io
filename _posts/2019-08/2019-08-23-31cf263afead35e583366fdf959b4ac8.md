This is a brief post about making my first Shiny App (see also). I made this app following a meeting of the Advancing Social Cognition lab (ASC-Lab) where we discussed this paper by Yzerbyt et al. (2018) proposing a new method for mediation analysis. Any attempt to detail the differences in methods is well beyond the scope of a blog post. The take home message is that the method proposed by Yzerbyt et al. (2018) is less prone to Type I errors (or false positives) than the most commonly used methods (e.g., Hayes 2017). In addition to identifying a problem and proposing a solution, the authors also provide the tools to implement their solution with an R package (Batailler et al. 2019). Unfortunately, not everyone uses R, and this is why I set about developing a simple way for SPSS users to access this new method.

Before I describe the Shiny App, I’ll briefly demonstrate the 2 functions that are included in the Shiny App. I’ll use the built in dataset `mtcars` and investigate the relationship between 1/4 mile time (`qsec`), gross horsepower (`hp`) and weight (`wt`), specifically:

- does horsepower predict 1/4 mile time?

- and is this relationship mediated by weight?


## Set up the dataframe

For ease of reusing code (particularly later on) I’ll save `mtcars` as a dataframe `df` and rename the variables of interest as `iv` (predictor variable), `dv` (outcome variable), and `mediator`.

```
df <- mtcars # create df from mtcars

# create new variables with generic names
df$dv <- df$qsec # save 1/4 mile time as dv
df$iv <- df$hp # save horsepower as iv
df$mediator <- df$wt # save weight as mediator
```

## Simple Regression

Before running the mediation I’ll run a quick regression to assess the nature of the relationship between the variables.

```
fit <- lm(dv ~ iv + mediator, data=df) # save the regression in an object 'fit'
summary(fit) # show the results
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = dv ~ iv + mediator, data = df)
## 
## Residuals:
## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max 
## -1.8283 -0.4055 -0.1464 0.3519 3.7030 
## 
## Coefficients:
## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) 
## (Intercept) 18.825585 0.671867 28.020 < 2e-16 ***
## iv -0.027310 0.003795 -7.197 6.36e-08 ***
## mediator 0.941532 0.265897 3.541 0.00137 ** 
## ---
## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 1.09 on 29 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared: 0.652, Adjusted R-squared: 0.628 
## F-statistic: 27.17 on 2 and 29 DF, p-value: 2.251e-07
```

As you can see from the output, 1/4 mile time is predicted by both horsepower and by weight.

## Simple Mediation

Now that we have a picture of the relationships between the variables we can run the mediation analysis. The code for this is detailed below.

```
JS_model <- mdt_simple(data = df, # create an object 'JS_model'
 DV = dv,
 IV = iv,
 M = mediator)
add_index(JS_model) # display the results of the mediation
```

```
## Test of mediation (simple mediation)
## ==============================================
## Variables:
## 
## - IV: iv 
## - DV: dv 
## - M: mediator 
## Paths:
## 
## Path Point estimate SE APA 
## ==== ============== ===== ======================
## a 0.009 0.002 t(30) = 4.80, p < .001
## b 0.942 0.266 t(29) = 3.54, p = .001
## c -0.018 0.003 t(30) = 5.49, p < .001
## c' -0.027 0.004 t(29) = 7.20, p < .001
## ==== ============== ===== ======================
## Indirect effect index:
## 
## - type: Indirect effect 
## - point estimate: 0.00885 
## - confidence interval:
## - method: Monte Carlo (5000 iterations)
## - level: 0.05 
## - CI: [0.00337; 0.0156]
## Fitted models:
## 
## - X -> Y 
## - X -> M 
## - X + M -> Y
```

- Here we can see that horsepower predicts both 1/4 mile time and weight.

- There is also an indirect effect of horsepower on 1/4 mile time through weight.


The full code for the app is below, for the next sections I’ll go through some of the key pieces of code.

## The Geography of the Shiny App

The Shiny App has two panels.

On the left we have:

- The data upload option

- A dropdown menu for selecting the data you wish to use (the uploaded file, the mtcars data set, or the iris data set)

- Dropdown menus for defining each of your variables,

- Text describing the App


- The output of the regression

- The output from the mediation analysis


The code for generating these panels is below (comments above relevant lines describe the purpose of the various sections):

```
# UI for app
ui<-(pageWithSidebar(

# We use headerPanel() to give a title to our app 
 headerPanel("JS Mediation"),
 
# use sidebarPanel() to create the content of the side panel (panel on the left)
 sidebarPanel
 (
# use fileInput() to create a dialogue for inputting a file
 fileInput("file1", "Upload SPSS File",
 multiple = TRUE,
 accept = c(".sav")),
# create a horizontal line break
 tags$hr(),
 
# create a dropdown menu for selecting the dataset to be used
 selectInput("dataset","Data:",
 choices =list(iris = "iris",
 mtcars = "mtcars",

# create a dropdown menu for selecting the Independent variable to be used

# use HTML() to input formatted text describing the App

))

```

## The Backend of the Shiny App

Above we have the code for setting up and modifying the look and feel of our app. Below we go through the code for making the app do what it is supposed to do. The code in full is at the bottom of this post, however I have isolated specific sections of code to describe their function.

### Inputting data from file

The code below runs `read.spss()` on whatever file you have uploaded using the dialogue box in the side panel and creates a dataframe called `inFile`.

```
 upload_data<-reactive({
 inFile <- input$file1
 if (is.null(inFile))
 return(NULL)
 read.spss(input$file1$datapath, to.data.frame = TRUE)
 })
 
 observeEvent(input$file1,{
 inFile<<-upload_data()
 })

```

### Selecting data and variables

The code below retrieves information about the dataset that is selected, and displays the variables associated with the selected dataset in the dropdown menus for each of your variables (IV, DV, & mediator).

```
# update variables based on the data
 observe({
# make sure upload exists
 if(!exists(input$dataset)) return() 
# retrieve names of columns (variable names) and save as 'var.opts'
 var.opts<-colnames(get(input$dataset))
# set var.opts as the options for the drop down menus
 updateSelectInput(session, "dv", choices = var.opts)
 updateSelectInput(session, "iv", choices = var.opts)
 updateSelectInput(session, "mediator", choices = var.opts)
 })
```

### Setting up data for analysis

Below we extract the data and variables selected in the dropdown menus and save them as objects that we can use in functions. Specifically we create a list `obj` which contains the vectors `dv`, `iv`, and `mediator`.

```
 
# get data object
 get_data<-reactive({
 if(!exists(input$dataset)) return() # if no upload
 check<-function(x){is.null(x) || x==""}
 if(check(input$dataset)) return()
# retrieve the selected data and create objects and 
 obj<-list(data=get(input$dataset),
 dv=input$dv,
 iv=input$iv,
 mediator=input$mediator
 )
 
# require all to be set to proceed
 if(any(sapply(obj,check))) return()
# make sure choices had a chance to update
 check<-function(obj){
 !all(c(obj$dv,obj$iv,obj$mediator) %in% colnames(obj$data))
 }
 if(check(obj)) return()
# return 'obj' on completion 
 obj
 })
 
```

### Running the analyses

Now that we can retrieve the selected data and variables, we can turn them into a dataframe and run our analyses on them.

#### Regression

The code below creates an object `output$fit` which contains the output of the regression.

```
 output$fit <- renderPrint({
# create an object 'data_list', which is a list that contains the selected data and variables
 dataset_list <- get_data()
 
# isloate the elements in the list as separate objects 
 a <- dataset_list$dv
 b <- dataset_list$iv
 m <- dataset_list$mediator
 c <- dataset_list$data
 
# create a dataframe 'df' from the object 'c' the selected dataset 
 df <- `colnames<-`(
 cbind.data.frame(
# we extract and use the variables from 'c' that have the same names as those selected
 c[which(colnames(c)==a)],
 c[which(colnames(c)==b)],
 c[which(colnames(c)==m)]
 ), c("dv","iv","mediator"))
# now we have a dataframe df with 3 variables named 'dv', 'iv', and 'mediator'

# we need to ensure data is numeric
 df$dv <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df$dv))
 df$iv <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df$iv))
 df$mediator <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df$mediator))
 
# using the same code previously discussed, we run the regression 
 fit <- lm(dv ~ iv + mediator, data=df)
 summary(fit) # show results
 
 })
```

#### Mediation

Below we follow mostly the same steps to create our dataframe, and this time we run the mediation instead of the regression.

```
 output$mediation <- renderPrint({
# create an object 'data_list', which is a list that contains the selected data and variables
 dataset_list <- get_data()
 
# isloate the elements in the list as separate objects 
 a <- dataset_list$dv
 b <- dataset_list$iv
 m <- dataset_list$mediator
 c <- dataset_list$data
 
# create a dataframe 'df' from the object 'c' the selected dataset 
 df <- `colnames<-`(
 cbind.data.frame(
# we extract and use the variables from 'c' that have the same names as those selected
 c[which(colnames(c)==a)],
 c[which(colnames(c)==b)],
 c[which(colnames(c)==m)]
 ), c("dv","iv","mediator"))
# now we have a dataframe df with 3 variables named 'dv', 'iv', and 'mediator'
 
# we need to ensure data is numeric
 df$dv <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df$dv))
 df$iv <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df$iv))
 df$mediator <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df$mediator))

# and we run the mediation using the same code as at the beginning of this post 
 JS_model <- mdt_simple(data = df,
 DV = dv,
 IV = iv,
 M = mediator)
 add_index(JS_model)
 })
```

Above I have described how I went about making my first Shiny App which makes a new method of mediation analysis accessible to SPSS users. Feel free to try it out (although I have not paid for a premium account with Shiny, so it might time out).

Both the `mtcars` dataset and the `iris` dataset are preloaded in the app if you want to try it but you don’t have any SPSS files to upload. If you are an R user hopefully this post might help you to make your own Shiny Apps to make R functionality available to your SPSS using colleagues. Many thanks to the examples online that helped me, particularly this example for uploading files and working with them.

(also if you have any suggestions for improving the app, or if I have left anything out, let me know)
