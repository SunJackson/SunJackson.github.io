When using R markdown in RStudio, I like to insert a new chunk using the shortcut `Cmd+Option+I`. Unfortunately I often press a key instead of “I” and end up folding all the chunks, getting something like this:

It often takes me a while (on Google) to figure out what I did and how to undo it. With this note to remind me, no longer!! The shortcut I accidentally used was `Cmd+Option+O`, which folds up all chunks. To unfold all chunks, use `Cmd+Shift+Option+O`.

The full list of RStudio keyboard shortcuts can be found here.
