**End-to-End Machine Learning for Experimental Physics: Using Simulated Data to Train a Neural Network for Object Detection in Video Microscopy**

We demonstrate a method for training a convolutional neural network with simulated images for usage on real-world experimental data. Modern machine learning methods require large, robust training data sets to generate accurate predictions. Generating these large training sets requires a significant up-front time investment that is often impractical for small-scale applications. Here we demonstrate a `full-stack’ computational solution, where the training data set is generated on-the-fly using a noise injection process to produce simulated data characteristic of the experimental system.

**How often should I access my online social networks?**

Users of online social networks are faced with a conundrum of trying to be always informed without having enough time or attention budget to do so. The retention of users on online social networks has important implications, encompassing economic, psychological and infrastructure aspects. In this paper, we pose the following question: what is the optimal rate at which users should access a social network? To answer this question, we propose an analytical model to determine the value of an access (VoA) to the social network. In the simple setting considered in this paper, VoA is defined as the chance of a user accessing the network and obtaining new content. Clearly, VoA depends on the rate at which sources generate content and on the filtering imposed by the social network. Then, we pose an optimization problem wherein the utility of users grows with respect to VoA but is penalized by costs incurred to access the network. Using the proposed framework, we provide insights on the optimal access rate. Our results are parameterized using Facebook data, indicating the predictive power of the approach.

**Local Score Dependent Model Explanation for Time Dependent Covariates**

The use of deep neural networks to make high risk decisions creates a need for global and local explanations so that users and experts have confidence in the modeling algorithms. We introduce a novel technique to find global and local explanations for time series data used in binary classification machine learning systems. We identify the most salient of the original features used by a black box model to distinguish between classes. The explanation can be made on categorical, continuous, and time series data and can be generalized to any binary classification model. The analysis is conducted on time series data to train a long short-term memory deep neural network and uses the time dependent structure of the underlying features in the explanation. The proposed technique attributes weights to features to explain an observations risk of belonging to a class as a multiplicative factor of a base hazard rate. We use a variation of the Cox Proportional Hazards regression, a Generalized Additive Model, to explain the effect of variables upon the probability of an in-class response for a score output from the black box model. The covariates incorporate time dependence structure in the features so the explanation is inclusive of the underlying time series data structure.

**Meta Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs**

The ability to reason over learned knowledge is an innate ability for humans and humans can easily master new reasoning rules with only a few demonstrations. While most existing studies on knowledge graph (KG) reasoning assume enough training examples, we study the challenging and practical problem of few-shot knowledge graph reasoning under the paradigm of meta-learning. We propose a new meta learning framework that effectively utilizes the task-specific meta information such as local graph neighbors and reasoning paths in KGs. Specifically, we design a meta-encoder that encodes the meta information into task-specific initialization parameters for different tasks. This allows our reasoning module to have diverse starting points when learning to reason over different relations, which is expected to better fit the target task. On two few-shot knowledge base completion benchmarks, we show that the augmented task-specific meta-encoder yields much better initial point than MAML and outperforms several few-shot learning baselines.

**Least Squares Approximation for a Distributed System**

In this work we develop a distributed least squares approximation (DLSA) method, which is able to solve a large family of regression problems (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, Cox’s model) on a distributed system. By approximating the local objective function using a local quadratic form, we are able to obtain a combined estimator by taking a weighted average of local estimators. The resulting estimator is proved to be statistically as efficient as the global estimator. In the meanwhile it requires only one round of communication. We further conduct the shrinkage estimation based on the DLSA estimation by using an adaptive Lasso approach. The solution can be easily obtained by using the LARS algorithm on the master node. It is theoretically shown that the resulting estimator enjoys the oracle property and is selection consistent by using a newly designed distributed Bayesian Information Criterion (DBIC). The finite sample performance as well as the computational efficiency are further illustrated by extensive numerical study and an airline dataset. The airline dataset is 52GB in memory size. The entire methodology has been implemented by Python for a de-facto standard Spark system. By using the proposed DLSA algorithm on the Spark system, it takes 26 minutes to obtain a logistic regression estimator whereas a full likelihood algorithm takes 15 hours to reaches an inferior result.

**Serverless Supercomputing: High Performance Function as a Service for Science**

Growing data volumes and velocities are driving exciting new methods across the sciences in which data analytics and machine learning are increasingly intertwined with research. These new methods require new approaches for scientific computing in which computation is mobile, so that, for example, it can occur near data, be triggered by events (e.g., arrival of new data), or be offloaded to specialized accelerators. They also require new design approaches in which monolithic applications can be decomposed into smaller components, that may in turn be executed separately and on the most efficient resources. To address these needs we propose funcX—a high-performance function-as-a-service (FaaS) platform that enables intuitive, flexible, efficient, scalable, and performant remote function execution on existing infrastructure including clouds, clusters, and supercomputers. It allows users to register and then execute Python functions without regard for the physical resource location, scheduler architecture, or virtualization technology on which the function is executed—an approach we refer to as ‘serverless supercomputing.’ We motivate the need for funcX in science, describe our prototype implementation, and demonstrate, via experiments on two supercomputers, that funcX can process millions of functions across more than 65000 concurrent workers. We also outline five scientific scenarios in which funcX has been deployed and highlight the benefits of funcX in these scenarios.

**Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization for Automated Machine Learning**

Automated machine learning has gained a lot of attention recently. Building and selecting the right machine learning models is often a multi-objective optimization problem. General purpose machine learning software that simultaneously supports multiple objectives and constraints is scant, though the potential benefits are great. In this work, we present a framework called Autotune that effectively handles multiple objectives and constraints that arise in machine learning problems. Autotune is built on a suite of derivative-free optimization methods, and utilizes multi-level parallelism in a distributed computing environment for automatically training, scoring, and selecting good models. Incorporation of multiple objectives and constraints in the model exploration and selection process provides the flexibility needed to satisfy trade-offs necessary in practical machine learning applications. Experimental results from standard multi-objective optimization benchmark problems show that Autotune is very efficient in capturing Pareto fronts. These benchmark results also show how adding constraints can guide the search to more promising regions of the solution space, ultimately producing more desirable Pareto fronts. Results from two real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the constrained multi-objective optimization capability offered by Autotune.

**Architecture and evolution of semantic networks in mathematics texts**

Knowledge is a network of interconnected concepts. Yet, precisely how the topological structure of knowledge constrains its acquisition remains unknown, hampering the development of learning enhancement strategies. Here we study the topological structure of semantic networks reflecting mathematical concepts and their relations in college-level linear algebra texts. We hypothesize that these networks will exhibit structural order, reflecting the logical sequence of topics that ensures accessibility. We find that the networks exhibit strong core-periphery architecture, where a dense core of concepts presented early is complemented with a sparse periphery presented evenly throughout the exposition; the latter is composed of many small modules each reflecting more narrow domains. Using tools from applied topology, we find that the expositional evolution of the semantic networks produces and subsequently fills knowledge gaps, and that the density of these gaps tracks negatively with community ratings of each textbook. Broadly, our study lays the groundwork for future efforts developing optimal design principles for textbook exposition and teaching in a classroom setting.

**Towards Diverse and Accurate Image Captions via Reinforcing Determinantal Point Process**

Although significant progress has been made in the field of automatic image captioning, it is still a challenging task. Previous works normally pay much attention to improving the quality of the generated captions but ignore the diversity of captions. In this paper, we combine determinantal point process (DPP) and reinforcement learning (RL) and propose a novel reinforcing DPP (R-DPP) approach to generate a set of captions with high quality and diversity for an image. We show that R-DPP performs better on accuracy and diversity than using noise as a control signal (GANs, VAEs). Moreover, R-DPP is able to preserve the modes of the learned distribution. Hence, beam search algorithm can be applied to generate a single accurate caption, which performs better than other RL-based models.

**Tensor-Train Parameterization for Ultra Dimensionality Reduction**

Locality preserving projections (LPP) are a classical dimensionality reduction method based on data graph information. However, LPP is still responsive to extreme outliers. LPP aiming for vectorial data may undermine data structural information when it is applied to multidimensional data. Besides, it assumes the dimension of data to be smaller than the number of instances, which is not suitable for high-dimensional data. For high-dimensional data analysis, the tensor-train decomposition is proved to be able to efficiently and effectively capture the spatial relations. Thus, we propose a tensor-train parameterization for ultra dimensionality reduction (TTPUDR) in which the traditional LPP mapping is tensorized in terms of tensor-trains and the LPP objective is replaced with the Frobenius norm to increase the robustness of the model. The manifold optimization technique is utilized to solve the new model. The performance of TTPUDR is assessed on classification problems and TTPUDR significantly outperforms the past methods and the several state-of-the-art methods.

**Reasoning-Driven Question-Answering for Natural Language Understanding**

Natural language understanding (NLU) of text is a fundamental challenge in AI, and it has received significant attention throughout the history of NLP research. This primary goal has been studied under different tasks, such as Question Answering (QA) and Textual Entailment (TE). In this thesis, we investigate the NLU problem through the QA task and focus on the aspects that make it a challenge for the current state-of-the-art technology. This thesis is organized into three main parts: In the first part, we explore multiple formalisms to improve existing machine comprehension systems. We propose a formulation for abductive reasoning in natural language and show its effectiveness, especially in domains with limited training data. Additionally, to help reasoning systems cope with irrelevant or redundant information, we create a supervised approach to learn and detect the essential terms in questions. In the second part, we propose two new challenge datasets. In particular, we create two datasets of natural language questions where (i) the first one requires reasoning over multiple sentences; (ii) the second one requires temporal common sense reasoning. We hope that the two proposed datasets will motivate the field to address more complex problems. In the final part, we present the first formal framework for multi-step reasoning algorithms, in the presence of a few important properties of language use, such as incompleteness, ambiguity, etc. We apply this framework to prove fundamental limitations for reasoning algorithms. These theoretical results provide extra intuition into the existing empirical evidence in the field.

**Fog Robotics: A Summary, Challenges and Future Scope**

Human-robot interaction plays a crucial role to make robots closer to humans. Usually, robots are limited by their own capabilities. Therefore, they utilise Cloud Robotics to enhance their dexterity. Its ability includes the sharing of information such as maps, images and the processing power. This whole process involves distributing data which intend to rise enormously. New issues can arise such as bandwidth, network congestion at backhaul and fronthaul systems resulting in high latency. Thus, it can make an impact on seamless connectivity between the robots, users and the cloud. Also, a robot may not accomplish its goal successfully within a stipulated time. As a consequence, Cloud Robotics cannot be in a position to handle the traffic imposed by robots. On the contrary, impending Fog Robotics can act as a solution by solving major problems of Cloud Robotics. Therefore to check its feasibility, we discuss the need and architectures of Fog Robotics in this paper. To evaluate the architectures, we used a realistic scenario of Fog Robotics by comparing them with Cloud Robotics. Next, latency is chosen as the primary factor for validating the effectiveness of the system. Besides, we utilised real-time latency using Pepper robot, Fog robot server and the Cloud server. Experimental results show that Fog Robotics reduces latency significantly compared to Cloud Robotics. Moreover, advantages, challenges and future scope of the Fog Robotics system is further discussed.

**Reinforcement Learning Based Graph-to-Sequence Model for Natural Question Generation**

Natural question generation (QG) is a challenging yet rewarding task, that aims to generate questions given an input passage and a target answer. Previous works on QG, however, either (i) ignore the rich structure information hidden in the word sequence, (ii) fail to fully exploit the target answer, or (iii) solely rely on cross-entropy loss that leads to issues like exposure bias and evaluation discrepancy between training and testing. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based graph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) architecture for the QG task. Our model consists of a Graph2Seq generator where a novel bidirectional graph neural network (GNN) based encoder is applied to embed the input passage incorporating the answer information via a simple yet effective Deep Alignment Network, and an evaluator where a mixed objective function combining both cross-entropy loss and RL loss is designed for ensuring the generation of semantically and syntactically valid text. The proposed model is end-to-end trainable, and achieves new state-of-the-art scores and outperforms all previous methods by a great margin on the SQuAD benchmark.

**Establishing Strong Baselines for the New Decade: Sequence Tagging, Syntactic and Semantic Parsing with BERT**

This paper presents new state-of-the-art models for three tasks, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and semantic parsing, using the cutting-edge contextualized embedding framework known as BERT. For each task, we first replicate and simplify the current state-of-the-art approach to enhance its model efficiency. We then evaluate our simplified approaches on those three tasks using token embeddings generated by BERT. 12 datasets in both English and Chinese are used for our experiments. The BERT models outperform the previously best-performing models by 2.5% on average (7.5% for the most significant case). Moreover, an in-depth analysis on the impact of BERT embeddings is provided using self-attention, which helps understanding in this rich yet representation. All models and source codes are available in public so that researchers can improve upon and utilize them to establish strong baselines for the next decade.

**ClustCrypt: Privacy-Preserving Clustering of Unstructured Big Data in the Cloud**

Security and confidentiality of big data stored in the cloud are important concerns for many organizations to adopt cloud services. One common approach to address the concerns is client-side encryption where data is encrypted on the client machine before being stored in the cloud. Having encrypted data in the cloud, however, limits the ability of data clustering, which is a crucial part of many data analytics applications, such as search systems. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we present an approach named ClustCrypt for efficient topic-based clustering of encrypted unstructured big data in the cloud. ClustCrypt dynamically estimates the optimal number of clusters based on the statistical characteristics of encrypted data. It also provides clustering approach for encrypted data. We deploy ClustCrypt within the context of a secure cloud-based semantic search system (S3BD). Experimental results obtained from evaluating ClustCrypt on three datasets demonstrate on average 60% improvement on clusters’ coherency. ClustCrypt also decreases the search-time overhead by up to 78% and increases the accuracy of search results by up to 35%

**Harmonized Multimodal Learning with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models**

Multimodal learning aims to discover the relationship between multiple modalities. It has become an important research topic due to extensive multimodal applications such as cross-modal retrieval. This paper attempts to address the modality heterogeneity problem based on Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs) to represent multimodal data in a common space. Previous multimodal GPLVM extensions generally adopt individual learning schemes on latent representations and kernel hyperparameters, which ignore their intrinsic relationship. To exploit strong complementarity among different modalities and GPLVM components, we develop a novel learning scheme called Harmonization, where latent model parameters are jointly learned from each other. Beyond the correlation fitting or intra-modal structure preservation paradigms widely used in existing studies, the harmonization is derived in a model-driven manner to encourage the agreement between modality-specific GP kernels and the similarity of latent representations. We present a range of multimodal learning models by incorporating the harmonization mechanism into several representative GPLVM-based approaches. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed models outperform the strong baselines for cross-modal retrieval tasks, and that the harmonized multimodal learning method is superior in discovering semantically consistent latent representation.

**FlexNER: A Flexible LSTM-CNN Stack Framework for Named Entity Recognition**

Named entity recognition (NER) is a foundational technology for information extraction. This paper presents a flexible NER framework compatible with different languages and domains. Inspired by the idea of distant supervision (DS), this paper enhances the representation by increasing the entity-context diversity without relying on external resources. We choose different layer stacks and sub-network combinations to construct the bilateral networks. This strategy can generally improve model performance on different datasets. We conduct experiments on five languages, such as English, German, Spanish, Dutch and Chinese, and biomedical fields, such as identifying the chemicals and gene/protein terms from scientific works. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of this framework.

**Deep Generalized Max Pooling**

Global pooling layers are an essential part of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). They are used to aggregate activations of spatial locations to produce a fixed-size vector in several state-of-the-art CNNs. Global average pooling or global max pooling are commonly used for converting convolutional features of variable size images to a fix-sized embedding. However, both pooling layer types are computed spatially independent: each individual activation map is pooled and thus activations of different locations are pooled together. In contrast, we propose Deep Generalized Max Pooling that balances the contribution of all activations of a spatially coherent region by re-weighting all descriptors so that the impact of frequent and rare ones is equalized. We show that this layer is superior to both average and max pooling on the classification of Latin medieval manuscripts (CLAMM’16, CLAMM’17), as well as writer identification (Historical-WI’17).

**Towards Explainable AI Planning as a Service**

Explainable AI is an important area of research within which Explainable Planning is an emerging topic. In this paper, we argue that Explainable Planning can be designed as a service — that is, as a wrapper around an existing planning system that utilises the existing planner to assist in answering contrastive questions. We introduce a prototype framework to facilitate this, along with some examples of how a planner can be used to address certain types of contrastive questions. We discuss the main advantages and limitations of such an approach and we identify open questions for Explainable Planning as a service that identify several possible research directions.

**AdaGCN: Adaboosting Graph Convolutional Networks into Deep Models**

The design of deep graph models still remains to be investigated and the crucial part is how to explore and exploit the knowledge from different hops of neighbors in an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN-like deep graph neural network architecture by incorporating AdaBoost into the computation of network; and the proposed graph convolutional network called AdaGCN~(AdaBoosting Graph Convolutional Network) has the ability to efficiently extract knowledge from high-order neighbors and integrate knowledge from different hops of neighbors into the network in an AdaBoost way. We also present the architectural difference between AdaGCN and existing graph convolutional methods to show the benefits of our proposal. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art prediction performance and the computational advantage of our approach AdaGCN.

**Towards Optimisation of Collaborative Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs**

Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) frameworks for knowledge graphs aim at integrating existing question answering (QA) components for implementing sequences of QA tasks (i.e. QA pipelines). The research community has paid substantial attention to CQAs since they support reusability and scalability of the available components in addition to the flexibility of pipelines. CQA frameworks attempt to build such pipelines automatically by solving two optimisation problems: 1) local collective performance of QA components per QA task and 2) global performance of QA pipelines. In spite offering several advantages over monolithic QA systems, the effectiveness and efficiency of CQA frameworks in answering questions is limited. In this paper, we tackle the problem of local optimisation of CQA frameworks and propose a three fold approach, which applies feature selection techniques with supervised machine learning approaches in order to identify the best performing components efficiently. We have empirically evaluated our approach over existing benchmarks and compared to existing automatic CQA frameworks. The observed results provide evidence that our approach answers a higher number of questions than the state of the art while reducing: i) the number of used features by 50% and ii) the number of components used by 76%.

**Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks**

Monotonic neural networks have recently been proposed as a way to define invertible transformations. These transformations can be combined into powerful autoregressive flows that have been shown to be universal approximators of continuous probability distributions. Architectures that ensure monotonicity typically enforce constraints on weights and activation functions, which enables invertibility but leads to a cap on the expressiveness of the resulting transformations. In this work, we propose the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN) architecture based on the insight that a function is monotonic as long as its derivative is strictly positive. In particular, this latter condition can be enforced with a free-form neural network whose only constraint is the positiveness of its output. We evaluate our new invertible building block within a new autoregressive flow (UMNN-MAF) and demonstrate its effectiveness on density estimation experiments. We also illustrate the ability of UMNNs to improve variational inference.

**A Tour of Convolutional Networks Guided by Linear Interpreters**

Convolutional networks are large linear systems divided into layers and connected by non-linear units. These units are the ‘articulations’ that allow the network to adapt to the input. To understand how a network manages to solve a problem we must look at the articulated decisions in entirety. If we could capture the actions of non-linear units for a particular input, we would be able to replay the whole system back and forth as if it was always linear. It would also reveal the actions of non-linearities because the resulting linear system, a Linear Interpreter, depends on the input image. We introduce a hooking layer, called a LinearScope, which allows us to run the network and the linear interpreter in parallel. Its implementation is simple, flexible and efficient. From here we can make many curious inquiries: how do these linear systems look like? When the rows and columns of the transformation matrix are images, how do they look like? What type of basis do these linear transformations rely on? The answers depend on the problems presented, through which we take a tour to some popular architectures used for classification, super-resolution (SR) and image-to-image translation (I2I). For classification we observe that popular networks use a pixel-wise vote per class strategy and heavily rely on bias parameters. For SR and I2I we find that CNNs use wavelet-type basis similar to the human visual system. For I2I we reveal copy-move and template-creation strategies to generate outputs.

**PMU Data Feature Considerations for Realistic, Synthetic Data Generation**

It is critical that the qualities and features of synthetically-generated, PMU measurements used for grid analysis matches those of measurements obtained from field-based PMUs. This ensures that analysis results generated by researchers during grid studies replicate those outcomes typically expected by engineers in real-life situations. In this paper, essential features associated with industry PMU-derived data measurements are analyzed for input considerations in the generation of vast amounts of synthetic power system data. Inherent variabilities in PMU data as a result of the random dynamics in power system operations, oscillatory contents, and the prevalence of bad data are presented. Statistical results show that in the generation of large datasets of synthetic, grid measurements, an inclusion of different data anomalies, ambient oscillation contents, and random cases of missing data samples due to packet drops helps to improve the realism of experimental data used in power systems analysis.

**Continuous Control for High-Dimensional State Spaces: An Interactive Learning Approach**

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become a powerful methodology to solve complex decision-making problems. However, DRL has several limitations when used in real-world problems (e.g., robotics applications). For instance, long training times are required and cannot be accelerated in contrast to simulated environments, and reward functions may be hard to specify/model and/or to compute. Moreover, the transfer of policies learned in a simulator to the real-world has limitations (reality gap). On the other hand, machine learning methods that rely on the transfer of human knowledge to an agent have shown to be time efficient for obtaining well performing policies and do not require a reward function. In this context, we analyze the use of human corrective feedback during task execution to learn policies with high-dimensional state spaces, by using the D-COACH framework, and we propose new variants of this framework. D-COACH is a Deep Learning based extension of COACH (COrrective Advice Communicated by Humans), where humans are able to shape policies through corrective advice. The enhanced version of D-COACH, which is proposed in this paper, largely reduces the time and effort of a human for training a policy. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the D-COACH framework in three different problems (simulated and with real robots), and show that its enhanced version reduces the human training effort considerably, and makes it feasible to learn policies within periods of time in which a DRL agent do not reach any improvement.

**Skill Transfer in Deep Reinforcement Learning under Morphological Heterogeneity**

Transfer learning methods for reinforcement learning (RL) domains facilitate the acquisition of new skills using previously acquired knowledge. The vast majority of existing approaches assume that the agents have the same design, e.g. same shape and action spaces. In this paper we address the problem of transferring previously acquired skills amongst morphologically different agents (MDAs). For instance, assuming that a bipedal agent has been trained to move forward, could this skill be transferred on to a one-leg hopper so as to make its training process for the same task more sample efficient? We frame this problem as one of subspace learning whereby we aim to infer latent factors representing the control mechanism that is common between MDAs. We propose a novel paired variational encoder-decoder model, PVED, that disentangles the control of MDAs into shared and agent-specific factors. The shared factors are then leveraged for skill transfer using RL. Theoretically, we study how the performance of PVED depends on its components and agent morphologies. Experimentally, PVED has been extensively validated on four MuJoCo environments. We demonstrate its performance compared to a state-of-the-art approach and several ablation cases, interpret and visualize the hidden factors, and identify avenues for future improvements.
