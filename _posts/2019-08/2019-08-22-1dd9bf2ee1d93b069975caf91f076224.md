**mRpostman** is an R package to help you to easy connect to your IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server and execute commands, such as listing mailboxes, searching and fetching messages in a tidy way. It calls ‘curl’ in background when issuing the IMAP commands (all credit to Jeroen Ooms and Daniel Stenberg).

So far, I have tested **mRpostman** with Gmail, Yahoo Mail and AOL Mail, but it should also work with other mail providers. I would be happy to hear other successful experiences from users.

ATTENTION: Before you start, you have to enable **“less secure apps access”** in your mail account settings.

Check out a detailed vignette HERE showing how to use the package!

I hope you enjoy **mRpostman**.
