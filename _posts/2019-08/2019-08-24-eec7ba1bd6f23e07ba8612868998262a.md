Intersection over Union (IoU) is the most popular evaluation metric used in the object detection benchmarks.➘ “Jaccard Index” …

Sparse coding (SC) is attracting more and more attention due to its comprehensive theoretical studies and its excellent performance in many signal processing applications. However, most existing sparse coding algorithms are nonconvex and are thus prone to becoming stuck into bad local minima, especially when there are outliers and noisy data. To enhance the learning robustness, in this paper, we propose a unified framework named Self-Paced Sparse Coding (SPSC), which gradually include matrix elements into SC learning from easy to complex. We also generalize the self-paced learning schema into different levels of dynamic selection on samples, features and elements respectively. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. …

Most of agents that learn policy for tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) lack the ability to communicate with people, which makes human-agent collaboration challenging. We believe that, in order for RL agents to comprehend utterances from human colleagues, RL agents must infer the mental states that people attribute to them because people sometimes infer an interlocutor’s mental states and communicate on the basis of this mental inference. This paper proposes PublicSelf model, which is a model of a person who infers how the person’s own behavior appears to their colleagues. We implemented the PublicSelf model for an RL agent in a simulated environment and examined the inference of the model by comparing it with people’s judgment. The results showed that the agent’s intention that people attributed to the agent’s movement was correctly inferred by the model in scenes where people could find certain intentionality from the agent’s behavior. … 

**Event-triggered Learning** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Efficient exchange of information is an essential aspect of intelligent collective behavior. Event-triggered control and estimation achieve some efficiency by replacing continuous data exchange between agents with intermittent, or event-triggered communication. Typically, model-based predictions are used at times of no data transmission, and updates are sent only when the prediction error grows too large. The effectiveness in reducing communication thus strongly depends on the quality of the prediction model. In this article, we propose event-triggered learning as a novel concept to reduce communication even further and to also adapt to changing dynamics. By monitoring the actual communication rate and comparing it to the one that is induced by the model, we detect mismatch between model and reality and trigger learning of a new model when needed. Specifically for linear Gaussian dynamics, we derive different classes of learning triggers solely based on a statistical analysis of inter-communication times and formally prove their effectiveness with the aid of concentration inequalities. …
