We see a trend where computing becomes a metered utility similar to how the electric grid evolved. Initially electricity was generated locally but economies of scale (and standardization) made it more efficient and economical to have utility companies managing the electric grid. Similar developments can be seen in computing where scientific grids paved the way for commercial cloud computing offerings. However, in our opinion, that evolution is far from finished and in this paper we bring forward the remaining challenges and propose a vision for the future of computing. In particular we focus on changes in cost of computing and high cost of human time in comparison that indicates that saving developer time is the most important for future of computing.
