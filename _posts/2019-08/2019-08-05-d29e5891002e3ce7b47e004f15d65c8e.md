**Time4sys2imi: A tool to formalize real-time system models under uncertainty**

Time4sys is a formalism developed by Thales, realizing a graphical specification for real-time systems. However, this formalism does not allow to perform formal analyses for real-time systems. So a translation of this tool to a formalism equipped with a formal semantics is needed. We present here Time4sys2imi, a tool translating Time4sys models into parametric timed automata in the input language of IMITATOR. This translation allows not only to check the schedulability of real-time systems, but also to infer some timing constraints (e.g., deadlines, offsets) guaranteeing schedulability. We successfully applied Time4sys2imi to various examples.

**Multi-stakeholder Recommendation and its Connection to Multi-sided Fairness**

There is growing research interest in recommendation as a multi-stakeholder problem, one where the interests of multiple parties should be taken into account. This category subsumes some existing well-established areas of recommendation research including reciprocal and group recommendation, but a detailed taxonomy of different classes of multi-stakeholder recommender systems is still lacking. Fairness-aware recommendation has also grown as a research area, but its close connection with multi-stakeholder recommendation is not always recognized. In this paper, we define the most commonly observed classes of multi-stakeholder recommender systems and discuss how different fairness concerns may come into play in such systems.

**Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning agents are prone to undesired behaviors due to reward mis-specification. Finding a set of reward functions to properly guide agent behaviors is particularly challenging in multi-agent scenarios. Inverse reinforcement learning provides a framework to automatically acquire suitable reward functions from expert demonstrations. Its extension to multi-agent settings, however, is difficult due to the more complex notions of rational behaviors. In this paper, we propose MA-AIRL, a new framework for multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which is effective and scalable for Markov games with high-dimensional state-action space and unknown dynamics. We derive our algorithm based on a new solution concept and maximum pseudolikelihood estimation within an adversarial reward learning framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate that MA-AIRL can recover reward functions that are highly correlated with ground truth ones, and significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of policy imitation.

**SenseFitting: Sense Level Semantic Specialization of Word Embeddings for Word Sense Disambiguation**

We introduce a neural network-based system of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for German that is based on SenseFitting, a novel method for optimizing WSD. We outperform knowledge-based WSD methods by up to 25% F1-score and produce a new state-of-the-art on the German sense-annotated dataset WebCAGe. Our method uses three feature vectors consisting of a) sense, b) gloss, and c) relational vectors to represent target senses and to compare them with the vector centroids of sample contexts. Utilizing widely available word embeddings and lexical resources, we are able to compensate for the lower resource availability of German. SenseFitting builds upon the recently introduced semantic specialization procedure Attract-Repel, and leverages sense level semantic constraints from lexical-semantic networks (e.g. GermaNet) or online social dictionaries (e.g. Wiktionary) to produce high-quality sense embeddings from pre-trained word embeddings. We evaluate our sense embeddings with a new SimLex-999 based similarity dataset, called SimSense, that we developed for this work. We achieve results that outperform current lemma-based specialization methods for German, making them comparable to results achieved for English.

**Optimizing Multi-GPU Parallelization Strategies for Deep Learning Training**

Deploying deep learning (DL) models across multiple compute devices to train large and complex models continues to grow in importance because of the demand for faster and more frequent training. Data parallelism (DP) is the most widely used parallelization strategy, but as the number of devices in data parallel training grows, so does the communication overhead between devices. Additionally, a larger aggregate batch size per step leads to statistical efficiency loss, i.e., a larger number of epochs are required to converge to a desired accuracy. These factors affect overall training time and beyond a certain number of devices, the speedup from leveraging DP begins to scale poorly. In addition to DP, each training step can be accelerated by exploiting model parallelism (MP). This work explores hybrid parallelization, where each data parallel worker is comprised of more than one device, across which the model dataflow graph (DFG) is split using MP. We show that at scale, hybrid training will be more effective at minimizing end-to-end training time than exploiting DP alone. We project that for Inception-V3, GNMT, and BigLSTM, the hybrid strategy provides an end-to-end training speedup of at least 26.5%, 8%, and 22% respectively compared to what DP alone can achieve at scale.

**Are Outlier Detection Methods Resilient to Sampling?**

Outlier detection is a fundamental task in data mining and has many applications including detecting errors in databases. While there has been extensive prior work on methods for outlier detection, modern datasets often have sizes that are beyond the ability of commonly used methods to process the data within a reasonable time. To overcome this issue, outlier detection methods can be trained over samples of the full-sized dataset. However, it is not clear how a model trained on a sample compares with one trained on the entire dataset. In this paper, we introduce the notion of resilience to sampling for outlier detection methods. Orthogonal to traditional performance metrics such as precision/recall, resilience represents the extent to which the outliers detected by a method applied to samples from a sampling scheme matches those when applied to the whole dataset. We propose a novel approach for estimating the resilience to sampling of both individual outlier methods and their ensembles. We performed an extensive experimental study on synthetic and real-world datasets where we study seven diverse and representative outlier detection methods, compare results obtained from samples versus those obtained from the whole datasets and evaluate the accuracy of our resilience estimates. We observed that the methods are not equally resilient to a given sampling scheme and it is often the case that careful joint selection of both the sampling scheme and the outlier detection method is necessary. It is our hope that the paper initiates research on designing outlier detection algorithms that are resilient to sampling.

**The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Recommendation**

Recommender systems are known to suffer from the popularity bias problem: popular (i.e. frequently rated) items get a lot of exposure while less popular ones are under-represented in the recommendations. Research in this area has been mainly focusing on finding ways to tackle this issue by increasing the number of recommended long-tail items or otherwise the overall catalog coverage. In this paper, however, we look at this problem from the users’ perspective: we want to see how popularity bias causes the recommendations to deviate from what the user expects to get from the recommender system. We define three different groups of users according to their interest in popular items (Niche, Diverse and Blockbuster-focused) and show the impact of popularity bias on the users in each group. Our experimental results on a movie dataset show that in many recommendation algorithms the recommendations the users get are extremely concentrated on popular items even if a user is interested in long-tail and non-popular items showing an extreme bias disparity.

**Lifelong and Interactive Learning of Factual Knowledge in Dialogues**

Dialogue systems are increasingly using knowledge bases (KBs) storing real-world facts to help generate quality responses. However, as the KBs are inherently incomplete and remain fixed during conversation, it limits dialogue systems’ ability to answer questions and to handle questions involving entities or relations that are not in the KB. In this paper, we make an attempt to propose an engine for Continuous and Interactive Learning of Knowledge (CILK) for dialogue systems to give them the ability to continuously and interactively learn and infer new knowledge during conversations. With more knowledge accumulated over time, they will be able to learn better and answer more questions. Our empirical evaluation shows that CILK is promising.

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for compact beam source modelling in Monte Carlo simulations**

A method is proposed and evaluated to model large and inconvenient phase space files used in Monte Carlo simulations by a compact Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is trained based on a phase space dataset to create a neural network, called Generator (G), allowing G to mimic the multidimensional data distribution of the phase space. At the end of the training process, G is stored with about 0.5 million weights, around 10 MB, instead of few GB of the initial file. Particles are then generated with G to replace the phase space dataset. This concept is applied to beam models from linear accelerators (linacs) and from brachytherapy seed models. Simulations using particles from the reference phase space on one hand and those generated by the GAN on the other hand were compared. 3D distributions of deposited energy obtained from source distributions generated by the GAN were close to the reference ones, with less than 1% of voxel-by-voxel relative difference. Sharp parts such as the brachytherapy emission lines in the energy spectra were not perfectly modeled by the GAN. Detailed statistical properties and limitations of the GAN-generated particles still require further investigation, but the proposed exploratory approach is already promising and paves the way for a wide range of applications.

**Simple Unsupervised Summarization by Contextual Matching**

We propose an unsupervised method for sentence summarization using only language modeling. The approach employs two language models, one that is generic (i.e. pretrained), and the other that is specific to the target domain. We show that by using a product-of-experts criteria these are enough for maintaining continuous contextual matching while maintaining output fluency. Experiments on both abstractive and extractive sentence summarization data sets show promising results of our method without being exposed to any paired data.

**Category-Aware Location Embedding for Point-of-Interest Recommendation**

Recently, Point of interest (POI) recommendation has gained ever-increasing importance in various Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). With the recent advances of neural models, much work has sought to leverage neural networks to learn neural embeddings in a pre-training phase that achieve an improved representation of POIs and consequently a better recommendation. However, previous studies fail to capture crucial information about POIs such as categorical information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model that generates a POI embedding incorporating sequential and categorical information from POIs. Our model consists of a check-in module and a category module. The check-in module captures the geographical influence of POIs derived from the sequence of users’ check-ins, while the category module captures the characteristics of POIs derived from the category information. To validate the efficacy of the model, we experimented with two large-scale LBSN datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods.

**Topological Machine Learning with Persistence Indicator Functions**

Techniques from computational topology, in particular persistent homology, are becoming increasingly relevant for data analysis. Their stable metrics permit the use of many distance-based data analysis methods, such as multidimensional scaling, while providing a firm theoretical ground. Many modern machine learning algorithms, however, are based on kernels. This paper presents persistence indicator functions (PIFs), which summarize persistence diagrams, i.e., feature descriptors in topological data analysis. PIFs can be calculated and compared in linear time and have many beneficial properties, such as the availability of a kernel-based similarity measure. We demonstrate their usage in common data analysis scenarios, such as confidence set estimation and classification of complex structured data.

**Observation-centered Kalman filters**

Various methods have been proposed for the nonlinear filtering problem, including the extended Kalman filter (EKF), iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and iterated unscented Kalman filter (IUKF). In this paper two new nonlinear Kalman filters are proposed and investigated, namely the observation-centered extended Kalman filter (OCEKF) and observation-centered unscented Kalman filter (OCUKF). Although the UKF and EKF are common default choices for nonlinear filtering, there are situations where they are bad choices. Examples are given where the EKF and UKF perform very poorly, and the IEKF and OCEKF perform well. In addition the IUKF and OCUKF are generally similar to the IEKF and OCEKF, and also perform well, though care is needed in the choice of tuning parameters when the bservation error is small. The reasons for this behaviour are explored in detail.

**Local Interpretation Methods to Machine Learning Using the Domain of the Feature Space**

As machine learning becomes an important part of many real world applications affecting human lives, new requirements, besides high predictive accuracy, become important. One important requirement is transparency, which has been associated with model interpretability. Many machine learning algorithms induce models difficult to interpret, named black box. Moreover, people have difficulty to trust models that cannot be explained. In particular for machine learning, many groups are investigating new methods able to explain black box models. These methods usually look inside the black models to explain their inner work. By doing so, they allow the interpretation of the decision making process used by black box models. Among the recently proposed model interpretation methods, there is a group, named local estimators, which are designed to explain how the label of particular instance is predicted. For such, they induce interpretable models on the neighborhood of the instance to be explained. Local estimators have been successfully used to explain specific predictions. Although they provide some degree of model interpretability, it is still not clear what is the best way to implement and apply them. Open questions include: how to best define the neighborhood of an instance? How to control the trade-off between the accuracy of the interpretation method and its interpretability? How to make the obtained solution robust to small variations on the instance to be explained? To answer to these questions, we propose and investigate two strategies: (i) using data instance properties to provide improved explanations, and (ii) making sure that the neighborhood of an instance is properly defined by taking the geometry of the domain of the feature space into account. We evaluate these strategies in a regression task and present experimental results that show that they can improve local explanations.

**Optimal Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Policies**

Control policies, trained using the Deep Reinforcement Learning, have been recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks introducing even very small perturbations to the policy input. The attacks proposed so far have been designed using heuristics, and build on existing adversarial example crafting techniques used to dupe classifiers in supervised learning. In contrast, this paper investigates the problem of devising optimal attacks, depending on a well-defined attacker’s objective, e.g., to minimize the main agent average reward. When the policy and the system dynamics, as well as rewards, are known to the attacker, a scenario referred to as a white-box attack, designing optimal attacks amounts to solving a Markov Decision Process. For what we call black-box attacks, where neither the policy nor the system is known, optimal attacks can be trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our attacks compared to existing attacks (usually based on Gradient methods). We further quantify the potential impact of attacks and establish its connection to the smoothness of the policy under attack. Smooth policies are naturally less prone to attacks (this explains why Lipschitz policies, with respect to the state, are more resilient). Finally, we show that from the main agent perspective, the system uncertainties and the attacker can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We actually demonstrate that using Reinforcement Learning techniques tailored to POMDP (e.g. using Recurrent Neural Networks) leads to more resilient policies.

**Bridging Commonsense Reasoning and Probabilistic Planning via a Probabilistic Action Language**

To be responsive to dynamically changing real-world environments, an intelligent agent needs to perform complex sequential decision-making tasks that are often guided by commonsense knowledge. The previous work on this line of research led to the framework called ‘interleaved commonsense reasoning and probabilistic planning’ (icorpp), which used P-log for representing commmonsense knowledge and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs) for planning under uncertainty. A main limitation of icorpp is that its implementation requires non-trivial engineering efforts to bridge the commonsense reasoning and probabilistic planning formalisms. In this paper, we present a unified framework to integrate icorpp’s reasoning and planning components. In particular, we extend probabilistic action language pBC+ to express utility, belief states, and observation as in POMDP models. Inheriting the advantages of action languages, the new action language provides an elaboration tolerant representation of POMDP that reflects commonsense knowledge. The idea led to the design of the system pbcplus2pomdp, which compiles a pBC+ action description into a POMDP model that can be directly processed by off-the-shelf POMDP solvers to compute an optimal policy of the pBC+ action description. Our experiments show that it retains the advantages of icorpp while avoiding the manual efforts in bridging the commonsense reasoner and the probabilistic planner.

**On Mutual Information Maximization for Representation Learning**

Many recent methods for unsupervised or self-supervised representation learning train feature extractors by maximizing an estimate of the mutual information (MI) between different views of the data. This comes with several immediate problems: For example, MI is notoriously hard to estimate, and using it as an objective for representation learning may lead to highly entangled representations due to its invariance under arbitrary invertible transformations. Nevertheless, these methods have been repeatedly shown to excel in practice. In this paper we argue, and provide empirical evidence, that the success of these methods might be only loosely attributed to the properties of MI, and that they strongly depend on the inductive bias in both the choice of feature extractor architectures and the parametrization of the employed MI estimators. Finally, we establish a connection to deep metric learning and argue that this interpretation may be a plausible explanation for the success of the recently introduced methods.
