A **new development version** is know available for the **package MetaLandSim** (v. 1.0.6). It can be downloaded from GitHub.

The user has to **run the following code** in order to install the package from GitHub:

library(devtools)install_github(“FMestre1/MetaLandSim”)

These changes were required because of recent improvements made to the package **rgrass7** (which allows to work on GRASS from R). MetaLandSim relies on rgrass7 to properly run the **function range_raster**.

One of the outputs MetaLandSim provides is a **simulation of range expansion** by a given species (with a given set of characteristics) in a given landscape (with a given connectivity). This function, range_raster, **converts the output of the simulation to rasters**.

The **final result are these two rasters** (bellow), but check out the **manual**, and **this paper** describing the package to get further details. Also, if you want to see how these results can be used, and combined with **Ecological Niche Models**, check out **this paper**.

I will update MetaLandSim on CRAN briefly.
