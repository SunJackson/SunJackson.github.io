**Housing Allocation Problem** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

There is a set of agents and a set of houses. Each agent has a strict preference list for a subset of houses. We need to find a matching such that some criterion is optimized. One such criterion is Pareto Optimality. A matching is Pareto optimal if no coalition of agents can be strictly better off by exchanging houses among themselves. …

We introduce Graphene, an Open IE system whose goal is to generate accurate, meaningful and complete propositions that may facilitate a variety of downstream semantic applications. For this purpose, we transform syntactically complex input sentences into clean, compact structures in the form of core facts and accompanying contexts, while identifying the rhetorical relations that hold between them in order to maintain their semantic relationship. In that way, we preserve the context of the relational tuples extracted from a source sentence, generating a novel lightweight semantic representation for Open IE that enhances the expressiveness of the extracted propositions. … 

**L1-norm Higher-Order Orthogonal Iteration (L1-HOOI)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Tucker decomposition is a common method for the analysis of multi-way/tensor data. Standard Tucker has been shown to be sensitive against heavy corruptions, due to its L2-norm-based formulation which places squared emphasis to peripheral entries. In this work, we explore L1-Tucker, an L1-norm based reformulation of standard Tucker decomposition. After formulating the problem, we present two algorithms for its solution, namely L1-norm Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (L1-HOSVD) and L1-norm Higher-Order Orthogonal Iterations (L1-HOOI). The presented algorithms are accompanied by complexity and convergence analysis. Our numerical studies on tensor reconstruction and classification corroborate that L1-Tucker, implemented by means of the proposed methods, attains similar performance to standard Tucker when the processed data are corruption-free, while it exhibits sturdy resistance against heavily corrupted entries. … 

**Stochastic Normalization Disturbance (SND)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Batch Normalization (BN) is ubiquitously employed for accelerating neural network training and improving the generalization capability by performing standardization within mini-batches. Decorrelated Batch Normalization (DBN) further boosts the above effectiveness by whitening. However, DBN relies heavily on either a large batch size, or eigen-decomposition that suffers from poor efficiency on GPUs. We propose Iterative Normalization (IterNorm), which employs Newton’s iterations for much more efficient whitening, while simultaneously avoiding the eigen-decomposition. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive study to show IterNorm has better trade-off between optimization and generalization, with theoretical and experimental support. To this end, we exclusively introduce Stochastic Normalization Disturbance (SND), which measures the inherent stochastic uncertainty of samples when applied to normalization operations. With the support of SND, we provide natural explanations to several phenomena from the perspective of optimization, e.g., why group-wise whitening of DBN generally outperforms full-whitening and why the accuracy of BN degenerates with reduced batch sizes. We demonstrate the consistently improved performance of IterNorm with extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over BN and DBN. …
