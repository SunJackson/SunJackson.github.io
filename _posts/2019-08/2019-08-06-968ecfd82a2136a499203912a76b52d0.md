 Section 3.2 of Ilyas et al. (2019) shows that training a model on only adversarial errors leads to
 non-trivial generalization on the original test set. We show that these experiments are a specific case of
 learning from errors. We start with a counterintuitive result — we take a completely mislabeled training set
 (without modifying the inputs) and use it to train a model that generalizes to the original test set. We
 then show that this result, and the results of Ilyas et al. (2019), are a special case of model
 distillation. In particular, since the incorrect labels are generated using a trained model, information
 about the trained model is being “leaked” into the dataset.
 We begin with the following question: what if we took the images in the training set (without any
 adversarial perturbations) and mislabeled them? Since the inputs are unmodified and mislabeled, intuition
 says that a model trained on this dataset should not generalize to the correctly-labeled test set.
 Nevertheless, we show that this intuition fails — a model *can* generalize.
 We first train a ResNet-18 on the CIFAR-10 training set for two epochs. The model reaches a training
 accuracy of 62.5% and a test accuracy of 63.1%. Next, we run the model on all of the 50,000 training data
 points and relabel them according to the model’s predictions. Then, we filter out all the correct
 predictions. We are now left with an incorrectly labeled training set of size 18,768. We show four
 examples on the left of the Figure below:

 We then randomly initialize a new ResNet-18 and train it only on this mislabeled dataset. We train for 50
 epochs and reach an accuracy of 49.7% on the *original* test set. The new model has only ever seen
 incorrectly labeled, unperturbed images but can still non-trivially generalize.
 


 How can this model and the models in Ilyas et al. (2019) generalize without seeing any correctly labeled
 data? Here, we show that since the incorrect labels are generated using a trained model, information is
 being “leaked” about that trained model into the mislabeled examples. In particular, this an indirect form
 of model distillation — training on this dataset allows a new
 model to somewhat recover the features of the original model.
 


 We first illustrate this distillation phenomenon using a two-dimensional problem. Then, we explore other
 peculiar forms of distillation for neural networks — -we transfer knowledge despite the inputs being from
 another task.
 

### Two-dimensional Illustration of Model Distillation


 We construct a dataset of adversarial examples using a two-dimensional binary classification problem. We
 generate 32 random two-dimensional data points in [0,1]2[0,1]^2[0,1]2 and assign each point a random binary label. We
 then train a small feed-forward neural network on these examples, predicting 32/32 of the examples correctly
 (panel (a) in the Figure below).

 Next, we create adversarial examples for the original model using an l∞l_{\infty}l∞​ ball of radius
 ϵ=0.12\epsilon=0.12ϵ=0.12. In panel (a) of the Figure above, we display the ϵ\epsilonϵ-ball around each training
 point. In panel (b), we show the adversarial examples which cause the model to change its prediction (from
 correct to incorrect). We train a new feed-forward neural network on this dataset, resulting in the model in
 panel (c).
 


 Although this new model has never seen a correctly labeled example, it is able to perform non-trivially on
 the original dataset, predicting 23/3223/3223/32 of the inputs correctly (panel (d) in the Figure). The new model’s
 decision boundary loosely matches the original model’s decision boundary, i.e., the original model has been
 somewhat distilled after training on its adversarial examples. This two-dimensional problem presents an
 illustrative version of the intriguing result that distillation can be performed using incorrect
 predictions.

 

### 
 Other Peculiar Forms of Distillation
 


 Our experiments show that we can distill models using mislabeled examples. In what other peculiar ways can
 we learn about the original model? Can we use only *out-of-domain* data?
 


 We train a simple CNN model on MNIST, reaching 99.1% accuracy. We then run this model on the FashionMNIST
 training set and save its argmax predictions. The resulting dataset is nonsensical to humans — a “dress” is
 labeled as an “8″.

 We then initialize a new CNN model and train it on this mislabeled FashionMNIST data. The resulting model
 reaches 91.04% accuracy on the MNIST test set. Furthermore, if we normalize the FashionMNIST images using
 the mean and variance statistics for MNIST, the model reaches 94.5% accuracy on the MNIST test set. This is
 another instance of recovering a functionally similar model to the original despite the new model only
 training on erroneous predictions.
 

### 
 Summary
 


 These results show that training a model using mislabeled adversarial examples is a special case of learning
 from prediction errors. In other words, the perturbations added to adversarial examples in Section 3.2 of
 Ilyas et al. (2019) are not necessary to enable learning.
 


**Response**: Since our experiments work across different architectures,
 “distillation” in weight space cannot arise. Thus, from what we understand, the
 “distillation” hypothesis suggested here is referring to “feature distillation”
 (i.e. getting models which use the same features as the original), which is
 actually precisely our hypothesis too. Notably, this feature distillation would
 not be possible if adversarial examples did not rely on “flipping” features that
 are good for classification (see World 1 and
 World 2) — in that case, the distilled
 model would only use features that generalize poorly, and would thus generalize
 poorly itself. 

 Moreover, we would argue that in the experiments presented (learning from
 mislabeled data), the same kind of distillation is happening. For instance, a
 moderately accurate model might associate “green background” with “frog” thus
 labeling “green” images as “frogs” (e.g., the horse in the comment’s figure).
 Training a new model on this dataset will thus associate “green” with “frog”
 achieving non-trivial accuracy on the test set (similarly for the “learning MNIST
 from Fashion-MNIST” experiment in the comment). This corresponds exactly to
 learning features from labels, akin to how deep networks “distill” a good
 decision boundary from human annotators. In fact, we find these experiments
 a very interesting illustration of feature distillation that complements
 our findings. 

 We also note that an analogy to logistic regression here is only possible
 due to the low VC-dimension of linear classifiers (namely, these classifiers
 have dimension ddd). In particular, given any classifier with VC-dimension
 kkk, we need at least kkk points to fully specify the classifier. Conversely, neural
 networks have been shown to have extremely large VC-dimension (in particular,
 bigger than the size of the training set ). So even though
 labelling d+1d+1d+1 random
 points model-consistently is sufficient to recover a linear model, it is not
 necessarily sufficient to recover a deep neural network. For instance, Milli et
 al. are not able to reconstruct a ResNet-18
 using only its predictions on random Gaussian inputs. (Note that we are using a
 ResNet-50 in our experiments.) 

 Finally, it seems that the only potentially problematic explanation for
 our experiments (namely, that enough model-consistent points can recover a
 classifier) is disproved by Preetum’s experiment.
 In particular, Preetum is able to design a
 dataset where training on mislabeled inputs *that are model-consistent*
 does not at all recover the decision boundary of the original model. More
 generally, the “model distillation” perspective raised here is unable to
 distinguish between the dataset created by Preetum below, and those created
{% raw %}
 with standard PGD (as in our D^det\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{det}D
{% endraw %}
det​ and
{% raw %}
 D^rand\widehat{\mathcal{D}}_{rand}D
{% endraw %}
rand​ datasets).
