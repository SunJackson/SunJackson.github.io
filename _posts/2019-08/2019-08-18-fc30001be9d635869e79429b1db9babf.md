Summarising `NA` by column in dataframes
Exploring the number of records containing missing values in a new setof data is an important and well known exploratory check. However, `NA`scan be introduced into your data for a multitude of other reasons, oftenas a side effect of data manipulations like transforming columns orperforming joins. In most cases, the behaviour is expected, butsometimes when things go wrong, tracing missing values back through asequence of steps can be a helpful diagnostic.

All of that is to say that it’s vital to have simple tools forinterrogating dataframes for missing values… enter `inspectdf`!

#### Missingness by column: `inspectdf::inspect_na()`

The `inspect_na()` function from the `inspectdf` package is a simpletool designed to quickly summarise the frequency of missingness bycolumns in a dataframe. Firstly, install the `inspectdf` package byrunning

```
install.packages("inspectdf")

```

Then load both the `inspectdf` and `dplyr` packages – the latter we’lljust use for its built-in `starwars` dataset.

```
# load packages
library(inspectdf)
library(dplyr)

# quick peek at starwars data that comes with dplyr
head(starwars)

```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 13
## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year gender
## 
## 1 Luke… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male 
## 2 C-3PO 167 75 gold yellow 112 
## 3 R2-D2 96 32 white, bl… red 33 
## 4 Dart… 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male 
## 5 Leia… 150 49 brown light brown 19 female
## 6 Owen… 178 120 brown, gr… light blue 52 male 
## # … with 5 more variables: homeworld , species , films ,
## # vehicles , starships 

```

So how many missing values are there in `starwars`? Even looking at theoutput of the `head()` function reveals that there are at least a few`NA`s in there. The use of the `inspect_na()` function is verystraightforward:

```
starwars %>% inspect_na

```

```
## # A tibble: 13 x 3
## col_name cnt pcnt
## 
## 1 birth_year 44 50.6 
## 2 mass 28 32.2 
## 3 homeworld 10 11.5 
## 4 height 6 6.90
## 5 hair_color 5 5.75
## 6 species 5 5.75
## 7 gender 3 3.45
## 8 name 0 0 
## 9 skin_color 0 0 
## 10 eye_color 0 0 
## 11 films 0 0 
## 12 vehicles 0 0 
## 13 starships 0 0

```

The output is a simple `tibble` with columns showing the count (`cnt`)and percentage (`pcnt`) of `NA`s corresponding to each column(`col_name`) in the `starwars` data. For example, we can see that the`birth_year` column has the highest number of `NA`s with over halfmissing. Note that the tibble is sorted in descending order of thefrequency of `NA` occurrence.

By adding the `show_plot` command, the `tibble` can also be displayedgraphically:

```
starwars %>% inspect_na %>% show_plot

```

Although this is a simple summary, and you’ll find many other ways to dothis in R, I use this *all of the time* and find it very convenient tohave a one-liner to call on. Code efficiency matters!

#### More on the `inspectdf` package and exploratory data analysis

`inspectdf` can be used to produce a number of common summaries withminimal effort. See previous posts to learn how to explore andvisualise categoricaldataand to calculate and display correlationcoefficients.For a more general overview, have a look at the packagewebsite.
