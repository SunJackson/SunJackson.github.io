This was perhaps the busiest LondonR sessions Iâ€™ve ever been to, but understandably so! The lecture hall usually has a fair number of free seats left, but on this occasion late-comers struggled to find free seats. Speaking to a couple of other attendees around me, nobody seemed to know in advance what Hadleyâ€™s talk was going to be about â€“ this was kept somewhat mysterious when the event opened for registration. Matt Aldridge (CEO of Mango Solutions) introduced the event, and apparently this is a brand new talk by Hadley: *Tidyverse: the greatest hits*.

Interestingly, this turned out to be one of those attention-catching titles â€“ what Hadley really planned to talk about was the greatest *mistakes* of the tidyverse. As he claims, whilst the intuitive expectation of good developers and R coders may be that they make fewer mistakes, itâ€™s more the case for him that he makes *many* mistakes *as fast as possible* â€“ which, I imagine, is partly responsible for his prolific body of work in R. Unfortunately, some of these â€œmistakesâ€� have become â€œpermanentâ€� within tidyverse, which in his talk he explained some of these oddities in the **tidyverse** that most users probably have questioned about at some point.

Hadley mentioned a number of these â€œpermanent mistakesâ€�, and probably two of those which **tidyverse** users resonated the most with are:

1. the conflicting function names with `stats::filter()` and `stats::lag()`

1. the use of the `+` operator rather than `%>%` in **ggplot2**

Most regular **tidyverse** users would probably have wondered on at least one occasion about the first case: why are there always function conflicts when we run `library(tidyverse)`, and how do we get rid of it? The function conflict happens because `dplyr::filter()` and the base `stats::filter()` have the same name, so it will always conflict if you load **tidyverse**. It is the classic programming problem of naming variables and functions: you may think a variable name is intuitive or sensible initially, but not thinking it through thoroughly enough can sometimes come back and bite you in the future.

Hadleyâ€™s argument for choosing `filter()` as the dplyr verb for filtering rows despite the existence of `stats::filter()` is because of the relatively niche applications of the latter function.

This is what the documentation of `stats::filter()` says about the function:

> 
Applies linear filtering to a univariate time series or to each series separately of a multivariate time series.


Iâ€™ve never used `stats::filter()` myself and personally find `filter()` to be quite an intuitive verb, so Iâ€™m not too much bothered by this one.

Another similar function-naming â€œmistakeâ€� that Hadley talked about is the lack of intuitiveness of `gather()` and `spread()`, where the criticism is that it isnâ€™t immediately clear to an unfamiliar **tidyr** user which of those functions converts data from long to wide format, and vice versa. Unlike `dplyr::filter()` where there are no plans for a new filtering or subsetting function, in the development version of **tidyr** there will be two new functions for pivoting data frames, `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()`, which remove the ambiguity you get in `spread()` and `gather()`. Note that there isnâ€™t any intent to deprecate `spread()` and `gather()`, but I think you simply get two new alternatives which make the code easier to read and use.

The other interesting mistake that Hadley talked about is the `+` operator in **ggplot2**. To put it simply, this refers to the problem that whilst the rest of the **tidyverse** uses the pipe operator `%>%` to chain analysis steps together, **ggplot2** alone uses a different operator. Hereâ€™s a simple illustration of the problem:

```
iris %>% # You can pipe
 select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width) %>% # Still piping 
 ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) + # You cannot use pipe here
 geom_point()
```

If you use the `%>%` operator instead of `+` once you start to use the ggplot functions, you get the following error message:

> 
Error: `mapping` must be created by `aes()` Did you use %>% instead of +?


This is very much a mistake of *legacy*, because the magrittr pipe `%>%` was not in use when **ggplot2** was written. Again, this feels like a quirk or inconvenience that **tidyverse** users will need to live with, but from a macro perspective **ggplot2** is still a fantastic package with powerful functionalities that played a significant role in popularising the use of R.

Hannah Frick lists a couple more points that Hadley mentioned during his talk:
