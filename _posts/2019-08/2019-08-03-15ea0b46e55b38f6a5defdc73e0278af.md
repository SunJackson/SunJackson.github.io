**TIOBE Index** is an index (ranking) that claims to represent the popularity of programming languages. Yihui (The creator of `blogdown` package), recently wrote a blogpost titled “On TIOBE Index and the era of decision fatigue” and I strongly recommend you to go through that before continuing with this post.

So the **Disclaimer** goes like this: *This post/author doesn’t believe that TIOBE Index is a fair way to measure/present popularity of programming languages and this is writtet just to teach you how to extract/get TIOBE Index programmatically using the R package `tiobeindexr` *

### tiobeindexr – Intro, Installation & Loading

`tiobeindexr` is an R package to extract TIOBE Index of the given month.

`tiobeindexr` is available on CRAN so you can install like below:

```
install.packages("tiobeindexr")
```

Once installed, it can be loaded like any other R package:

```
library(tiobeindexr)
```

```
## Downloading TIOBE Index Data using your Internet...
```

When `tiobeindexr` is loaded for the first time in the given session, it downloads the required data from the internet.

### Visualising Top Changes of TIOBE Index This Month vs Previous Month

As you can see in the output of the previous section, `top_20()` also gives us the % change MoM (Month-over-Month) which we can use to see the top changes.

For simplicity, We’ll load the entire `tidyverse` package and use `ggplot2`’s bar-plot to visualize the changes.

```
library(tidyverse)

top_20() %>% 
 mutate(Change = as.numeric(gsub('%','',Change))) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`Programming Language`,Change), y = Change, 
 fill = `Programming Language`,
 label = paste0(Change, "%"))) +
 geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
 coord_flip() +
 geom_text(nudge_x = 0.1) +
 xlab('Programming Language') +
 ggtitle('Programming Languages Change this Month') 
```

### Summary

Hence, we learnt how to use `tiobeindexr` to programmatically download `TIOBE Index` and visualize insights from it. And, alongisde we also learnt that TIOBE Index in fact isn’t a fair represenation of the popularity of programming languages
