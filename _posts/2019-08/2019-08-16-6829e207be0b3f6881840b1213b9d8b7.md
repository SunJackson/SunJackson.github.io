This post will discuss ways of handling huge numbers in R using the **gmp** package.

## **The gmp package**

The **gmp** package provides us a way of dealing with really large numbers in R. For example, let’s suppose we want to multiple 10250 by itself. Mathematically we know the result should be 10500. But if we try this calculation in base R we get Inf for infinity.

However, we can get around this using the **gmp** package. Here, we can convert the integer 10 to an object of the *bigz* class. This is an implementation that allows us to handle very large numbers. Once we convert an integer to a *bigz* object, we can use it to perform calculations with regular numbers in R (there’s a small caveat coming).

One note that we need to be careful about is what numbers we use to convert to *bigz* objects. In the example above, we convert the integer 10 to *bigz*. This works fine for our calculations because 10 is not a very large number in itself. However, let’s suppose we had converted 10250 to a *bigz* object instead. If we do this, the number 10250 becomes a double data type, which causes a loss in precision for such a number. Thus the result we see below isn’t really 10250:

![](https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/double-losing-precision-in-r.png?w=640)


A way around this is to input the number we want as a character into *as.bigz*. For example, we know that 10250 is the number 1 followed by 250 zeros. We can create a character that represents this number like below:

Thus, we can use this idea to create *bigz* objects:

In case you run into issues with the above line returning an NA value, you might want to try turning scientific notation off. You can do that using the base *options* command.

If scientific notation is not turned off, you may have cases where the character version of the number looks like below, which results in an NA being returned by *as.bigz*.

**“1e250”**

In general, numbers can be input to **gmp** functions as characters to avoid this or other precision issues.

## **Finding the next prime**

The **gmp** package can find the first prime larger than an input number using the *nextprime* function.

## **Find the GCD of two huge numbers**

We can find the GCD of two large numbers using the *gcd* function:

## **Factoring numbers into primes**

**gmp** also provides a way to factor numbers into primes. We can do this using the *factorize* function.

## **Matrices of large numbers**

**gmp** also supports creating matrices with *bigz* objects.

We can also perform typical operations with our matrix, like find its inverse, using base R functions:

## **Sampling random (large) numbers uniformly**

We can sample large numbers from a discrete uniform distribution using the *urand.bigz* function.

The *nb* parameter represents how many integers we want to sample. Thus, in this example, we’ll get 100 integers returned. *size = 5000* tells the function to sample the integers from the inclusive range of 0 to 25000 – 1. In general you can sample from the range 0 to 2size – 1.
