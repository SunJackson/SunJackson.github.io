When fed with a 2D color image, a CNN constrained with a global average pooling layer, outputs after the last convolutional layer a set of filters (blue, red ... green in figure above) that get redued to a vector after global average pooling. This vector is then connected to a final classification layer to output the predicted class.

Each filter (blue, red, ... green), contains a 2D low-level spatial information about the image that got distilled after layers of successive convolutions.

Each weight w1, w2, ... wn represent the partial importance of each reduced filter in determining the output class (Australian terrier).


These filters and weights adjust throughout training by the back-propagation algorithm.

The author of the paper defined class activation map as a weighted sum of the filters by the weights w1, w2, ... wn

**A Class Activation Map is therefore a sum of a set of spatial 2D activations (i.e filters) weighted with respect to their relative importance in determining the output class.**

When a class activation map is generated, it obviously has not the dimension of the initial image (it has the dimension of filters of the last conv layer). To be able to use it and superpose it to the input, an upsampling opreation is done to resize it.

When superposed to the initial image, CAM is represented as a heatmap in which discriminative regions are painted in **red**.
