Prologue In R, one of the “go to” functions for kernel density estimation is density() from base R package ‘stats’. Given numeric sample, it returns a set of x-y pairs on estimated density curve. It is also a main “workhorse” for estimating continuous distributions in my ‘pdqr’ package.However, output of density() highly depends on values of its arguments. Some of them define kernel density estimation algorithm, and the others are responsible for different properties of output set of x-y pairs.
