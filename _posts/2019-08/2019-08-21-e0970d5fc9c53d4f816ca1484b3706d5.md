**Topic Extraction** is an integral part of IE (Information Extraction) from Corpus of Text to understand what are all the key things the corpus is talking about. While this can be achieved naively using unigrams and bigrams, a more intelligent way of doing it with an algorithm called `RAKE` is what we’re going to see in this post.

### Udpipe

`udpipe` is an NLP-focused R package created and opensourced by this organization bnosac. Thanks to them, `udpipe` is the R package that many a times solves the pain of not having native `spacy` for R.

### Udpipe – Installation

```
install.packages("udpipe")
```

### Udpipe – Loading

```
library("udpipe")
```

### Udpipe – Language Model

An NLP library is as good as its Language Model because the Language model contains the recipe of how to annotate your text corpus. So, before we proceed further, we need to download the language model for us to use. In this case, We’ll download English Language model as we’re going to do Topic Extraction for English Reviews (Text).

```
en <- udpipe::udpipe_download_model("english")
```

Language model, once downloaded can be used later on without requiring to be redownloaded for every session.

### Customer Reviews – Only Negative (1 & 2-star)

We’ll pick only the negative reviews (1 & 2-star) to understand what pain points are customers talking about while rating Amazon bad.

```
reviews_neg <- reviews[reviews$Rating %in% c('1','2'),]

nrow(reviews_neg)
```

```
## [1] 68
```

### Customer Reviews – Annotation

We’re going to do Topic Extraction from the above extracted 70 Reviews. But before we can proceed with Topic Analysis, We need to annotate the text with the language model that we downloaded above.

```
model <- udpipe_load_model("english-ewt-ud-2.3-181115.udpipe")

doc <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(model, reviews_neg$Review)
```

Let’s look at the object `doc` to see what’s there in it.

```
names(as.data.frame(doc))
```

```
## [1] "doc_id" "paragraph_id" "sentence_id" "sentence" 
## [5] "token_id" "token" "lemma" "upos" 
## [9] "xpos" "feats" "head_token_id" "dep_rel" 
## [13] "deps" "misc"
```

Considering the scope of this post is **Topic Analysis**, I’ll leave out the basics of NLP (to understand the above terms, if you’re not familiar) for another post.

### Topic Analysis

Let’s load up `tidyverse` to kickstart our Analysis

```
library(tidyverse)
```

and make a bar chart of the top 10 topics based on the rake score.

```
topics %>% 
 head() %>% 
 ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = keyword,
 y = rake), stat = "identity",
 fill = "#ff2211") +
 
 theme_minimal() +
 labs(title = "Top Topics of Negative Customer Reviews",
 subtitle = "Amazon US iOS App",
 caption = "Apple App Store")
```

That’s a nice plot indicating the top customer pain points. Seems the latest update and its error messages didn’t go well with the Customers. This is a simple bar plot but the output of `RAKE` could also be used to make a correlation plot between `rake score` and `freq` to add extra dimension in understanding More frequently occuring topics.

### Summary

`udpipe` is a very handy package if you are in the business of NLP and Text Analytics. It also supports multiple other Languages like German, French other than English.
