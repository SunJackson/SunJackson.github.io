Within a typhoon, another TokyoR Meetup! … well not really it turned outto be a false alarm and the weather was a wonderful 30 degrees Celsiuswith 800% humidity as usual in Tokyo. My gripes with the weather aside thismonth’s meetup was held at Cresco, an ITmanagement strategy company, in their headquarters in Shinagawa, Tokyo.

In line with my previous round up posts:

I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my effortswill help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider Rcommunity. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links fromother sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic ofa certain talk. You can follow **Tokyo.R** by searching for the#TokyoR hashtag on Twitter.

Anyways…

Let’s get started!

As with every TokyoR meetup, we beganwith a set of beginner user focused talks:

## ill_identified: Econometrics vs. Machine Learning

`@ill_identified` gave a talk on a more general industry topic ratherthan about R specifically by talking about the differences between econometrics andmachine learning/A.I. To start off he listed some good resources (inEnglish) to read from the economics/econometrics side of the discussion:

From looking at the methods that both fields use like multiple linearregression, logistic regression (GLMs), Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC),non-parametric regression, etc. it seems as though they might be thesame thing… but an important distinction can be made in that:

- Economics/Econometrics == Causal Inference

- Machine Learning == Prediction


Frank Harrell in Road Map for Choosing Between Statistical Modeling andMachine Learning as well asMiguel Hernan in Data science is science’s second chance to get causalinference right: A classification of data sciencetasks discuss this in length if youwant to take a look.

`@ill_identified` then took us through a couple examples of causalinference from a variety of economics research focusing on the spreadand popularity of Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) andDifference-In-Differences (DID) in the field.

There was a talk on DID at last year’s Japan.RConference that you can findhere!

From the side of machine learning, Athey(2018) talked about how up tothe present, economists have been trying to fit their model to theentirety of the data available to them, leading to potential problems ofover-fitting. To counteract this problem Athey notes how the field canlearn from machine learning by using cross-validation techniques andpenalized models.

For causal inference from the machine learning side of the discussion,`@ill_identified` talked about Judea Pearl’s answer of Quora to thequestion, “What are the differences between econometrics, statistics,and machinelearning?”.

In the answer, Judea Pearl makes the distinction between standard ML andadvanced ML, namely that the former (while specifically including deeplearning and neural networks in this category) “fits a function to astream of data and plays the same role as statistical analysis, takingus from samples to properties of distribution functions.” while thelatter “goes beyond distributions onto the process that generates thedata, and so, allows us to manage policy interventions andcounter-factual reasoning”. He then points to two of his works, 7 Toolsof Causal Inference with Reflections on MachineLearning and The Book ofWhy (written with Dana MacKenzie) forfurther reading. It is in the former work that Judea Pearl talks aboutthe three levels of the causal hierarchy:

- Level 1: Association

- Level 2: Intervention

- Level 3: Counterfactuals

There is a lot of debate centered on “Potential Outcomes” theory positedby Neyman & Rubin versus Pearl’s “Causal Graphs/SEM” approaches in thepast while Andrew Gelman has also talked about the issuehere(2009)and here(2011).Very recently, Guido Imbens submitted an article, Potential Outcome andDirected Acyclic Graph Approaches to Causality: Relevance for EmpiricalPractice in Economics that discussesthis in length that is probably worth checking out as well!

From the Rubin side of the debate Guido Imbens, Susan Athey, and ViktorChernozhukov stand out as the primary researchers.

**Athey**:

**Chernozhukov**:

In the final section `@ill_identified` went over a few new methods inA.I./ML that provided some evidence to show that A.I./ML does indeedhave similarities with econometrics mainly through the application ofthe structural estimation approach to modeling. A good overview isArtificial Intelligence as Structural Estimation: EconomicInterpretations of Deep Blue, Bonanza, and AlphaGo – MitsuruIgami while you can read about thespecific AIs discussed in more detail below.

## kilometer00: R interface to Python

TokyoR organizer and frequent BeginneR session speaker `@kilometer00`talked about using Python with R.

To familiarize the audience with Python he went over quite a number ofslides showing the similarities and differences in syntax between thetwo languages.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-varnames.PNG?w=49%25)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-pkgcall.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-pkgcall.PNG?w=49%25)




Next, `@kilometer00` talked about the {reticulate} package which allowsyou to call Python from R and can provide translation between R andPython objects (such as R and Pandas data frames or R matrices and NumPyarrays). Using {reticulate} he talked about the importance of having anisolated and independent environment, to keep Python in a “sandbox”-edvirtual environment for security and reproducibility. To do this`@kilometer00` likes to use Pipenv.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-pipenv2.PNG?w=49%25&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-pipenv2.PNG?w=49%25)




Once you’re done with all the set-up, you can install {reticulate} fromCRAN and attach your Python virtualenv with `reticulate::use_python()`and then you can finally start doing stuff! But be wary of type errorswhen you’re coding:

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-typeerror.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-typeerror.PNG?w=350)


You can also use Python in a R Markdown document by setting the codechunk to run it. With a recent development in RMD you can now also shareobjects from different languages by putting a prefix in front of theobject name!

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-pytoR.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/reticulate-pytoR.PNG?w=350)


Funnily enough you can also run R in Python in R:

## wkwk_soprano: Creating network graphs with R!

It’s been a while since `@wkwk_soprano` used R (5 years!) but he’s comeback with aplomb by talking about network graphs at Tokyo.R! Networkgraphs are used in all sorts of fields of study including physics,chemistry, linguistics, and the social sciences. In industry you mightsee them as part of a recommendation graph between a customer andproducts on sale. Frustrated by the fact that he didn’t have a fun dataset to use the {network} package on, `@wkwk_soprano` decided to createhis own data set based on his favorite manga, One Piece!

By counting up the times a character appeared in one panel of the mangawith another he slowly built up a co-occurrence matrix of all thecharacters from Volume 1 to Volume 23. It took him about one hour pervolume to create this data set, now that’s dedication!

![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/onepiece-network-graph.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/onepiece-network-graph.PNG?w=350)


You can find the gum-gum fruits of his labor here.

After creating the data `@wkwk_soprano` wanted to do some analysis on itlike graph embedding via DeepWalk or Large-scale Information NetworkEmbedding (LINE). There’s actually a R package calledRline to implement this method buthe found that it was difficult to install and it hadn’t been updated ina while so he went with the original C++implementation from Jian Tang etal. The result was an output of the distributed representation of allthe characters in the data.

![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/onepiece-distrirep.PNG?w=350&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/onepiece-distrirep.PNG?w=350)


Lastly, `@wkwk_soprano` wanted to find similarities between One Piececharacters so he used cosine similarity using this codesnippetwhich allows you to extract top ‘N’ similar items from network embeddingmatrices. Taking a look at some popular characters he was somewhatdisappointed in the results as from his extensive knowledge of the storyhe knew some of the character similarities just weren’t right!

## gepuro: Translating `tidyverse.org` into Japanese!

After being involved in the Japanese translation of Feature Engineeringfor Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists,`@gepuro` thought about trying his hand at translating `tidyverse.org`in Japanese!

In recent months there have been big changes in major `tidyverse`packages such as {tidyr} and {ggplot2} with accompanying articles toboot. These articles, especially the new pivot functions vignette, arethe ones `@gepuro` and fellow TokyoR community members such as `@Atsusy`have started working on in the past few weeks. To do the translationthere are three key steps:

1. Create a Github account

1. Log into GitLocalize

1. Access the specific GitLocalize repo where your translation projectis located


GitLocalize looks like this:

![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/gepuro-translate2.PNG?w=450&is-pending-load=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/ryo-n7.github.io/assets/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup_files/gepuro-translate2.PNG?w=450)


Once you’re done, you create a “Review Request” which is checked by themaintainer `@gepuro` for any errors. He’ll receive the “Review Request”as a Pull Request on the `R Lang Document JA` repo and if everything isOK it’ll be merged in!

There are other ways to contribute to the project as well such as:

- Helping to make the text sound more naturally Japanese

- Create the blogdown website of the Japanese translation

- Create a vocab list of common R terminology in Japanese to use as areference

- and more!


I enjoyed this talk as it was similar to the talk by Riva Quiroga ontranslating the “R for Data Science” book and R data sets into Spanishthat I heard at user!2019 a few weeks ago (the talk is covered in myblogposthere). Ifyou’re good at English and Japanese you can join the #translationchannel on the Tokyo.R slack!

In other news, there was an announcement that this year’s Japan.RConference will be on December 7th!

## Other Talks

`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle withJapanese R users as it’s the largest regular meetup here in Japan. We’refinally taking a break next month so the next meetup will be on**September 28** and it will be a special session in **{Shiny}**!

Talks in English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come joinus!
