At the bottom of the R for macOS Developer’s Page there’s mention of an “other binary” called “RSwitch” that is *“a small GUI that allows you to switch between R versions quickly (if you have multiple versions of R framework installed).”* Said switching requires you to use the “tar.gz” versions of R from the R for macOS Developer’s Page since the official CRAN binary installers clean up after themselves quite nicely to prevent potentially wacky behavior.

All the RSwitch GUI did was change the `Current` alias target in `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions` to the appropriate version. You can do that from the command line but the switcher GUI was created so that means some folks prefer click-switching and I have found myself using the GUI on occasion (before it stopped working on macOS Vista^wCatalina).

Since I:

- work on Catalina most of the day

- play with oldrel and devel versions of R

- needed to brush up on Swift 5 coding

- wanted RSwitch as a menubar app vs one with a dialog that I could easily lose across 15 desktops

- decided to see if it was possible to make it work sandboxed (TLDR: it isn’t)

- really wanted a different icon for the binary

- couldn’t sleep last night


there was sufficient justification to create a 64-bit version of this app.

You can clone the project from any of the following social coding sites:

and, you can either compile it yourself — which is recommended since it’s 2019 and the days of even remotely trusting binaries off the internet are long gone — or build it. It *should* work on 10.14+ since I set that as the target, but file an issue where you like if you have, well, *issues* with the code or binary.

Once you do have it working, there will be a dial-switch menu in the menubar and a menu that should look something like:

The item with the checkbox is the `Current` alias.

### FIN

Kick the tyres, file issues & PRs as you’re wont to do and prepare for the forthcoming clickpocalypse as Apple nears their GA release of Catalina.
