Today is my 6 month anniversary of starting this blog! ğŸ�‰

In my First 50 Days of Blogging post, I outlined some (rather ambitious) goals for my first year of blogging (Year One):

- Publish **50** blog posts.

- Get a **million** pageviews.

- Grow my newsletter to **10,000** subscribers.


Hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m at as of today:

- Published **24** blog posts.

- Gotten **314k** pageviews.

- Grown my newsletter to **2,000** subscribers.


Iâ€™m on track to hit my blog posts goal, but thereâ€™s still some ground to make up for the other two goals ğŸ˜….

Letâ€™s get into the numbers more!

## Pageviews

Hereâ€™s a graph of my blogâ€™s pageviews over the past 6 months:






The spikes correspond to popular posts:

My top 5 posts by pageviews so far are:

The top 5 consist of 4 Machine Learning posts, each of which got popular on Hacker News shortly after being published. The 5th is a dark horse: my guide to Building Multiplayer (.io) Web Games. Most of the traffic to that post has been organic - aside from a podcast I did on that subject, there wasnâ€™t significant attention for that post when it came out.

## Organic Traffic

Despite being behind on my Year One goals, I see a clear silver lining: **organic traffic** growth. ğŸ“ˆ






Performance on Google Search Results over the past 6 months


My blog has gone from 20 clicks per day at the 50 day mark to **500+** clicks per day at the 6 month mark!

Incredibly, my simple Gini Impurity post is by far my blogâ€™s biggest driver of organic traffic. Itâ€™s usually the second (sometimes the first!) result on Google when you search â€œgini impurityâ€�:






One of my original reasons for starting this blog was to â€œlearn more about and get firsthand experience with SEO,â€� and Iâ€™m excited to continue doing so.

## Conclusion

Itâ€™s been a great journey so far, and Iâ€™m excited for what the future holds. As always, **thank you to my readers** from the past 6 months! See you at the Year One recap.
