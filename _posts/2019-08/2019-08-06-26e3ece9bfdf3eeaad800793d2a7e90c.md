 A figure in Ilyas, et. al. that struck me as particularly
 interesting
 was the following graph showing a correlation between adversarial transferability between architectures and
 their
 tendency to learn similar non-robust features.

 One way to interpret this graph is that it shows how well a particular architecture is able to capture
 non-robust features in an image.
 Since the non-robust features are defined by the non-robust features ResNet-50 captures,
 NRFresnetNRF_{resnet}NRFresnet​, what this graph really shows is how well an architecture captures NRFresnetNRF_{resnet}NRFresnet​.
 



 Notice how far back VGG is compared to the other models.
 


 In the unrelated field of neural style transfer, VGG-based neural networks are also quite special since non-VGG architectures are
 known to not work very well This phenomenon is discussed at length in this
 Reddit thread. without some sort of parameterization trick .
 The above interpretation of the graph provides an alternative explanation for this phenomenon.
 Since VGG is unable to capture non-robust features as well as other architectures, the outputs for style
 transfer actually look more correct to humans!
To follow this argument, note that the perceptual losses used in neural style transfer are
 dependent on matching features learned by a separately trained image classifier. If these learned
 features don’t make sense to humans (non-robust features), the outputs for neural style transfer won’t
 make sense either.



 Before proceeding, let’s quickly discuss the results obtained by Mordvintsev, et. al. in Differentiable Image
 Parameterizations, where they show that non-VGG architectures can work for style transfer by using a
 simple technique previously established in feature visualization.
 In their experiment, instead of optimizing the output image in RGB space, they optimize it in Fourier space,
 and run the image through a series of transformations (e.g jitter, rotation, scaling) before passing it
 through the neural network.
 


 Can we reconcile this result with our hypothesis linking neural style transfer and non-robust features?
 


 One possible theory is that all of these image transformations *weaken* or even *destroy*
 non-robust features.
 Since the optimization can no longer reliably manipulate non-robust features to bring down the loss, it is
 forced to use robust features instead, which are presumably more resistant to the applied image
 transformations (a rotated and jittered flappy ear still looks like a flappy ear).
 

## A quick experiment


 Testing our hypothesis is fairly straightforward:
 Use an adversarially robust classifier for neural style transfer and see
 what happens.
 


 I evaluated a regularly trained (non-robust) ResNet-50 with a robustly trained ResNet-50 from Engstrom, et.
 al. on their performance on neural style transfer.
 For comparison, I performed the same algorithm with a regular VGG-19
  .
 


 To ensure a fair comparison despite the different networks having different optimal hyperparameters, I
 performed a small grid search for each image and manually picked the best output per network.
 Further details can be read in a footnote
 
 L-BFGS was used for optimization as it showed faster convergence
 over Adam.
 For ResNet-50, the style layers used were the ReLu outputs after each of the 4 residual blocks,
 [relu2_x,relu3_x,relu4_x,relu5_x][relu2\_x, relu3\_x, relu4\_x, relu5\_x][relu2_x,relu3_x,relu4_x,relu5_x] while the content layer used was relu4_xrelu4\_xrelu4_x.
 For VGG-19, style layers [relu1_1,relu2_1,relu3_1,relu4_1,relu5_1][relu1\_1,relu2\_1,relu3\_1,relu4\_1,relu5\_1][relu1_1,relu2_1,relu3_1,relu4_1,relu5_1] were used with a content layer
 relu4_2relu4\_2relu4_2.
 In VGG-19, max pooling layers were replaced with avg pooling layers, as stated in Gatys, et. al.
 or observed in the accompanying Colaboratory notebook.
 


 The results of this experiment can be explored in the diagram below.
 


 Success!
 The robust ResNet shows drastic improvement over the regular ResNet.
 Remember, all we did was switch the ResNet’s weights, the rest of the code for performing style transfer is
 exactly the same!
 


 A more interesting comparison can be done between VGG-19 and the robust ResNet.
 At first glance, the robust ResNet’s outputs seem on par with VGG-19.
 Looking closer, however, the ResNet’s outputs seem slightly noisier and exhibit some artifacts
 This is more obvious when the output image is initialized not with the content image, but with
 Gaussian noise..
 


 It is currently unclear exactly what causes these artifacts.
 One theory is that they are checkerboard artifacts
 caused by
 non-divisible kernel size and stride in the convolution layers.
 They could also be artifacts caused by the presence of max pooling layers
 in ResNet.
 An interesting implication is that these artifacts, while problematic, seem orthogonal to the
 problem that
 adversarial robustness solves in neural style transfer.
 

## VGG remains a mystery


 Although this experiment started because of an observation about a special characteristic of VGG
 nets, it
 did not provide an explanation for this phenomenon.
 Indeed, if we are to accept the theory that adversarial robustness is the reason VGG works out of
 the box
 with neural style transfer, surely we’d find some indication in existing literature that VGG is
 naturally
 more robust than other architectures.
 


 A few papers
 indeed show
 that VGG architectures are slightly more robust than ResNet.
 However, they also show that AlexNet, not known to work well
 for
 neural style transferAs shown by Dávid Komorowicz
 in
 this blog post.
 , is
 *above* VGG in terms of this “natural robustness”.
 


 Perhaps adversarial robustness just happens to incidentally fix or cover up the true reason non-VGG
 architectures fail at style transfer (or other similar algorithms
 
 In fact, neural style transfer is not the only pretrained classifier-based iterative image
 optimization
 technique that magically works better with adversarial robustness. In Engstrom, et. al., they show that feature visualization via activation
 maximization works on robust classifiers *without*
 enforcing
 any priors or regularization (e.g. image transformations and decorrelated parameterization) used
 by
 previous work. In a recent chat with Chris
 Olah, he
 pointed out that the aforementioned feature visualization techniques actually work well on VGG
 *without* these priors, just like style transfer!
 
 ) i.e. adversarial robustness is a sufficient but unnecessary condition for good style transfer.
 Whatever the reason, I believe that further examination of VGG is a very interesting direction for
 future
 work.
 

**Response Summary**: Very interesting
 results, highlighting the effect of non-robust features and the utility of
 robust models for downstream tasks. We’re excited to see what kind of impact
 robustly trained models will have in neural network art! We were also really
 intrigued by the mysteriousness of VGG in the context of style transfer
. As such, we took a
 deeper dive which found some interesting links between robustness and style
 transfer that suggest that perhaps robustness does indeed play a role here. 

**Response**: These experiments are really cool! It is interesting that
 preventing the reliance of a model on non-robust features improves performance
 on style transfer, even without an explicit task-related objective (i.e. we
 didn’t train the networks to be better for style transfer). 

 We also found the discussion of VGG as a “mysterious network” really
 interesting — it would be valuable to understand what factors drive style transfer
 performance more generally. Though not a complete answer, we made a couple of
 observations while investigating further: 

*Style transfer does work with AlexNet: *One wrinkle in the idea that
 robustness is the “secret ingredient” to style transfer could be that VGG is not
 the most naturally robust network — AlexNet is. However, based on our own
 testing, style transfer does seem to work with AlexNet out-of-the-box, as
 long as we use a few early layers in the network (in a similar manner to
 VGG): 
![](https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/images/alexnetworks.png)



 Observe that even though style transfer still works, there are checkerboard
 patterns emerging — this seems to be a similar phenomenon to the one noticed
 in the comment in the context of robust models.
 This might be another indication that these two phenomena (checkerboard
 patterns and style transfer working) are not as intertwined as previously
 thought.
 

*From prediction robustness to layer robustness: * Another
 potential wrinkle here is that both AlexNet and VGG are not that
 much more robust than ResNets (for which style transfer completely fails),
 and yet seem to have dramatically better performance. To try to
 explain this, recall that style transfer is implemented as a minimization of a
 combined objective consisting of a style loss and a content loss. We found,
 however, that the network we use to compute the
 style loss is far more important
 than the one for the content loss. The following demo illustrates this — we can
 actually use a non-robust ResNet for the content loss and everything works just
 fine:
![](https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/images/stylematters.png)


Therefore, from now on, we use a fixed ResNet-50 for the content loss as a
 control, and only worry about the style loss. 

Now, note that the way that style loss works is by using the first few
 layers of the relevant network. Thus, perhaps it is not about the robustness of
 VGG’s predictions, but instead about the robustness of the layers that we actually use
 for style transfer? 

 To test this hypothesis, we measure the robustness of a layer fff as:
 

 Essentially, this quantity tells us how much we can change the
 output of that layer f(x)f(x)f(x) within a small ball, normalized by how far apart
 representations are between images in general. We’ve plotted this value for
 the first few layers in a couple of different networks below: 
![](https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/images/robustnesses.png)


 Here, it becomes clear that, the first few layers of VGG and AlexNet are
 actually almost as robust as the first few layers of the robust ResNet!
 This is perhaps a more convincing indication that robustness might have
 something to with VGG’s success in style transfer after all.
 

 Finally, suppose we restrict style transfer to only use a single layer of
 the network when computing the style lossUsually style transfer uses
 several layers in the loss function to get the most visually appealing results — here we’re only interested in whether or not style transfer works (i.e.
 actually confers some style onto the image).. Again, the more
 robust layers seem to indeed work better for style transfer! Since all of the
 layers in the robust ResNet are robust, style transfer yields non-trivial
 results even using the last layer alone. Conversely, VGG and AlexNet seem to
 excel in the earlier layers (where they are non-trivially robust) but fail when
 using exclusively later (non-robust) layers: 
![](https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/images/styletransfer.png)


 Of course, there is much more work to be done here, but we are excited
 to see further work into understanding the role of both robustness and the VGG
 in network-based image manipulation.
