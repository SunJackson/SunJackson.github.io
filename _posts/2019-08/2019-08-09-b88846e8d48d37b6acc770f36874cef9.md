The Monash Faculty of Information Technology is indisputably one of the very best IT-focused teaching and research institutes on the planet, and is experiencing massive growth, attracting the very best academic IT talent. A key component of this journey is the establishment of a new world-class Computer Vision Group, guided by the vision of Professor Jianfei Cai. Computer Vision is an exciting and ground-breaking arena of inter-disciplinary research, exploring cutting edge technology in areas such as 3D vision, vision+language, weakly supervised or self-supervised classification, detection and segmentation tasks.

The position requires a passion for research, a proven research track record in computer vision, an ability to work independently as well as lead a team, and a willingness to work on inter-disciplinary research projects and seek external funding. The successful candidate will align with the group goal on building a world-class computer vision team.

The regional area is renowned for its dramatic coastline, extensive parks, exotic wildlife, and the Yarra Valley wine region.

This is a unique opportunity to join a leading “Group of 8” University with top-rankings and like-minded, passionate academics. If you feel you have the drive and expertise to contribute to this cutting-edge group, then we encourage you to apply!
