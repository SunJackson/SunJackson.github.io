Hubert Baniecki created an awesome package dime for serverless HTML interactive model exploration. The experimental version is at Github, here is the pkgdown website. It is a part of the DrWhy.AI project.

**How does it work?**

With the DALEX package you can create local and global model explanations for machine learning models. Each explanation can be visualized with a genetic *plot()* function.Hubert created a generic *plotD3()* function which turns each explanation into an interactive D3 plot (with the help of r2d3 package). With the dime package you can combine few interactive explanations into a single dashboard. And the dashboard is serverless, you can host it at github or anywhere.

For example, the gif below shows how to combine a break down plot (local feature attribution) with ceteris paribus profiles (detailed analysis of a single variable). You can click a variable of interest to activate an appropriate ceteris paribus profile (click to play).

With the dime package you can combine any number of interactive widgets into a single dashboard. You can connect local, global explanations or EDA tools like histograms or barplots.

It’s very easy to generate such website. Just create an explainer and call the *modelStudio()* function.

The dime package is still in the experimental phase. Your feedback is welcomed. Feel free to submit an issue with comments or ideas.
