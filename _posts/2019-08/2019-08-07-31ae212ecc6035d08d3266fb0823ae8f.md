**InfoGraph: Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Graph-Level Representation Learning via Mutual Information Maximization**

This paper studies learning the representations of whole graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. Graph-level representations are critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures (e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semi-supervised scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the current supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph classification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is superior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models.

**Distributed Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for the Internet-of-Things**

Due to the high demand in computation and memory, deep learning solutions are mostly restricted to high-performance computing units, e.g., those present in servers, Cloud, and computing centers. In pervasive systems, e.g., those involving Internet-of-Things (IoT) technological solutions, this would require the transmission of acquired data from IoT sensors to the computing platform and wait for its output. This solution might become infeasible when remote connectivity is either unavailable or limited in bandwidth. Moreover, it introduces uncertainty in the ‘data production to decision making’-latency, which, in turn, might impair control loop stability if the response should be used to drive IoT actuators. In order to support a real-time recall phase directly at the IoT level, deep learning solutions must be completely rethought having in mind the constraints on memory and computation characterizing IoT units. In this paper we focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specific deep learning solution for image and video classification, and introduce a methodology aiming at distributing their computation onto the units of the IoT system. We formalize such a methodology as an optimization problem where the latency between the data-gathering phase and the subsequent decision-making one is minimized. The methodology supports multiple IoT sources of data as well as multiple CNNs in execution on the same IoT system, making it a general-purpose distributed computing platform for CNN-based applications demanding autonomy, low decision-latency, and high Quality-of-Service.

**A Survey on Compressive Sensing: Classical Results and Recent Advancements**

Recovering sparse signals from linear measurements has demonstrated outstanding utility in a vast variety of real-world applications. Compressive sensing is the topic that studies the associated raised questions for the possibility of a successful recovery. This topic is well-nourished and numerous results are available in the literature. However, their dispersity makes it challenging and time-consuming for new readers and practitioners to quickly grasp its main ideas and classical algorithms, and further touch upon the recent advancements in this surging field. Besides, the sparsity notion has already demonstrated its effectiveness in many contemporary fields. Thus, these results are useful and inspiring for further investigation of related questions in these emerging fields from new perspectives. In this survey, we gather and overview vital classical tools and algorithms in compressive sensing and describe significant recent advancements. We conclude this survey by a numerical comparison of the performance of described approaches on an interesting application.

**RuleKit: A Comprehensive Suite for Rule-Based Learning**

Rule-based models are often used for data analysis as they combine interpretability with predictive power. We present RuleKit, a versatile tool for rule learning. Based on a sequential covering induction algorithm, it is suitable for classification, regression, and survival problems. The presence of a user-guided induction facilitates verifying hypotheses concerning data dependencies which are expected or of interest. The powerful and flexible experimental environment allows straightforward investigation of different induction schemes. The analysis can be performed in batch mode, through RapidMiner plug-in, or R package. A documented Java API is also provided for convenience. The software is publicly available at GitHub under GNU AGPL-3.0 license.

**Linear Dynamics: Clustering without identification**

Clustering time series is a delicate task; varying lengths and temporal offsets obscure direct comparisons. A natural strategy is to learn a parametric model foreach time series and to cluster the model parameters rather than the sequences themselves. Linear dynamical systems are a fundamental and powerful parametric model class. However, identifying the parameters of a linear dynamical systems is a venerable task, permitting provably efficient solutions only in special cases. In this work, we show that clustering the parameters of unknown linear dynamical systems is, in fact, easier than identifying them. We analyze a computationally efficient clustering algorithm that enjoys provable convergence guarantees under a natural separation assumption. Although easy to implement, our algorithm is general, handling multi-dimensional data with time offsets and partial sequences. Evaluating our algorithm on both synthetic data and real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, we see significant improvements in clustering quality over existing baselines.

**Weight Friction: A Simple Method to Overcome Catastrophic Forgetting and Enable Continual Learning**

In recent years, deep neural networks have found success in replicating human-level cognitive skills, yet they suffer from several major obstacles. One significant limitation is the inability to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned tasks, a shortcoming known as catastrophic forgetting. In this research, we propose a simple method to overcome catastrophic forgetting and enable continual learning in neural networks. We draw inspiration from principles in neurology and physics to develop the concept of weight friction. Weight friction operates by a modification to the update rule in the gradient descent optimization method. It converges at a rate comparable to that of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and can operate over multiple task domains. It performs comparably to current methods while offering improvements in computation and memory efficiency.

**SANTLR: Speech Annotation Toolkit for Low Resource Languages**

While low resource speech recognition has attracted a lot of attention from the speech community, there are a few tools available to facilitate low resource speech collection. In this work, we present SANTLR: Speech Annotation Toolkit for Low Resource Languages. It is a web-based toolkit which allows researchers to easily collect and annotate a corpus of speech in a low resource language. Annotators may use this toolkit for two purposes: transcription or recording. In transcription, annotators would transcribe audio files provided by the researchers; in recording, annotators would record their voice by reading provided texts. We highlight two properties of this toolkit. First, SANTLR has a very user-friendly User Interface (UI). Both researchers and annotators may use this simple web interface to interact. There is no requirement for the annotators to have any expertise in audio or text processing. The toolkit would handle all preprocessing and postprocessing steps. Second, we employ a multi-step ranking mechanism facilitate the annotation process. In particular, the toolkit would give higher priority to utterances which are easier to annotate and are more beneficial to achieving the goal of the annotation, e.g. quickly training an acoustic model.

**Toward Understanding Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning**

We study the relationship between catastrophic forgetting and properties of task sequences. In particular, given a sequence of tasks, we would like to understand which properties of this sequence influence the error rates of continual learning algorithms trained on the sequence. To this end, we propose a new procedure that makes use of recent developments in task space modeling as well as correlation analysis to specify and analyze the properties we are interested in. As an application, we apply our procedure to study two properties of a task sequence: (1) total complexity and (2) sequential heterogeneity. We show that error rates are strongly and positively correlated to a task sequence’s total complexity for some state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that, surprisingly, the error rates have no or even negative correlations in some cases to sequential heterogeneity. Our findings suggest directions for improving continual learning benchmarks and methods.

**MMF: Attribute Interpretable Collaborative Filtering**

Collaborative filtering is one of the most popular techniques in designing recommendation systems, and its most representative model, matrix factorization, has been wildly used by researchers and the industry. However, this model suffers from the lack of interpretability and the item cold-start problem, which limit its reliability and practicability. In this paper, we propose an interpretable recommendation model called Multi-Matrix Factorization (MMF), which addresses these two limitations and achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy by exploiting common attributes that are present in different items. In the model, predicted item ratings are regarded as weighted aggregations of attribute ratings generated by the inner product of the user latent vectors and the attribute latent vectors. MMF provides more fine grained analyses than matrix factorization in the following ways: attribute ratings with weights allow the understanding of how much each attribute contributes to the recommendation and hence provide interpretability; the common attributes can act as a link between existing and new items, which solves the item cold-start problem when no rating exists on an item. We evaluate the interpretability of MMF comprehensively, and conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to show that MMF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy.

**The Use of Binary Choice Forests to Model and Estimate Discrete Choice Models**

We show the equivalence of discrete choice models and the class of binary choice forests, which are random forest based on binary choice trees. This suggests that standard machine learning techniques based on random forest can serve to estimate discrete choice model with an interpretable output. This is confirmed by our data driven result that states that random forest can accurately predict the choice probability of any discrete choice model. Our framework has unique advantages: it can capture behavioral patterns such as irrationality or sequential searches; it handles nonstandard formats of training data that result from aggregation; it can measure product importance based on how frequently a random customer would make decisions depending on the presence of the product; it can also incorporate price information. Our numerical results show that binary choice forest can outperform the best parametric models with much better computational times.

**Ensemble Neural Networks (ENN): A gradient-free stochastic method**

In this study, an efficient stochastic gradient-free method, the ensemble neural networks (ENN), is developed. In the ENN, the optimization process relies on covariance matrices rather than derivatives. The covariance matrices are calculated by the ensemble randomized maximum likelihood algorithm (EnRML), which is an inverse modeling method. The ENN is able to simultaneously provide estimations and perform uncertainty quantification since it is built under the Bayesian framework. The ENN is also robust to small training data size because the ensemble of stochastic realizations essentially enlarges the training dataset. This constitutes a desirable characteristic, especially for real-world engineering applications. In addition, the ENN does not require the calculation of gradients, which enables the use of complicated neuron models and loss functions in neural networks. We experimentally demonstrate benefits of the proposed model, in particular showing that the ENN performs much better than the traditional Bayesian neural networks (BNN). The EnRML in ENN is a substitution of gradient-based optimization algorithms, which means that it can be directly combined with the feed-forward process in other existing (deep) neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), broadening future applications of the ENN.

**Machinic Surrogates: Human-Machine Relationships in Computational Creativity**

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its sub-branch machine learning (ML) promise machines that go beyond the boundaries of automation and behave autonomously. Applications of these machines in creative practices such as art and design entail relationships between users and machines that have been described as a form of collaboration or co-creation between computational and human agents. This paper uses examples from art and design to argue that this frame is incomplete as it fails to acknowledge the socio-technical nature of AI systems, and the different human agencies involved in their design, implementation, and operation. Situating applications of AI-enabled tools in creative practices in a spectrum between automation and autonomy, this paper distinguishes different kinds of human engagement elicited by systems deemed automated or autonomous. Reviewing models of artistic collaboration during the late 20th century, it suggests that collaboration is at the core of these artistic practices. We build upon the growing literature of machine learning and art to look for the human agencies inscribed in works of computational creativity, and expand the co-creation frame to incorporate emerging forms of human-human collaboration mediated through technical artifacts such as algorithms and data.

**Predicting Dynamic Embedding Trajectory in Temporal Interaction Networks**

Modeling sequential interactions between users and items/products is crucial in domains such as e-commerce, social networking, and education. Representation learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of users and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However, existing dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in the embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network model that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs two recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at every interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory of a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that learns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These estimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To make the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates time-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six experiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks—future interaction prediction and state change prediction—using four real-world datasets. We show that JODIE outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in these tasks by at least 20% in predicting future interactions and 12% in state change prediction.

**Attentive Normalization**

**A systematic review of fuzzing based on machine learning techniques**

Security vulnerabilities play a vital role in network security system. Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to reduce damage in advance. However, traditional fuzzing techniques have many challenges, such as how to mutate input seed files, how to increase code coverage, and how to effectively bypass verification. Machine learning technology has been introduced as a new method into fuzzing test to alleviate these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine learning technology for fuzzing test in recent years, analyzes how machine learning improve the fuzz process and results, and sheds light on future work in fuzzing. Firstly, this paper discusses the reasons why machine learning techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies six different stages in which machine learning have been used. Then this paper systematically study the machine learning based fuzzing models from selection of machine learning algorithm, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters setting. Next, this paper assesses the performance of the machine learning models based on the frequently used evaluation metrics. The results of the evaluation prove that machine learning technology has an acceptable capability of categorize predictive for fuzzing. Finally, the comparison on capability of discovering vulnerabilities between traditional fuzzing tools and machine learning based fuzzing tools is analyzed. The results depict that the introduction of machine learning technology can improve the performance of fuzzing. However, there are still some limitations, such as unbalanced training samples and difficult to extract the characteristics related to vulnerabilities.

**Deep Reinforcement Learning in System Optimization**

The recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning have opened new horizons and opportunities to tackle various problems in system optimization. Such problems are generally tailored to delayed, aggregated, and sequential rewards, which is an inherent behavior in the reinforcement learning setting, where an agent collects rewards while exploring and exploiting the environment to maximize the long term reward. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization.

**Softmax Dissection: Towards Understanding Intra- and Inter-clas Objective for Embedding Learning**

The softmax loss and its variants are widely used as objectives for embedding learning, especially in applications like face recognition. However, the intra- and inter-class objectives in the softmax loss are entangled, therefore a well-optimized inter-class objective leads to relaxation on the intra-class objective, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose to dissect the softmax loss into independent intra- and inter-class objective (D-Softmax). With D-Softmax as objective, we can have a clear understanding of both the intra- and inter-class objective, therefore it is straightforward to tune each part to the best state. Furthermore, we find the computation of the inter-class objective is redundant and propose two sampling-based variants of D-Softmax to reduce the computation cost. Training with regular-scale data, experiments in face verification show D-Softmax is favorably comparable to existing losses such as SphereFace and ArcFace. Training with massive-scale data, experiments show the fast variants of D-Softmax significantly accelerates the training process (such as 64x) with only a minor sacrifice in performance, outperforming existing acceleration methods of softmax in terms of both performance and efficiency.

**To Learn or Not to Learn: Visual Localization from Essential Matrices**

Visual localization is the problem of estimating a camera within a scene and a key component in computer vision applications such as self-driving cars and Mixed Reality. State-of-the-art approaches for accurate visual localization use scene-specific representations, resulting in the overhead of constructing these models when applying the techniques to new scenes. Recently, deep learning-based approaches based on relative pose estimation have been proposed, carrying the promise of easily adapting to new scenes. However, it has been shown such approaches are currently significantly less accurate than state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing this behavior. To this end, we propose a novel framework for visual localization from relative poses. Using a classical feature-based approach within this framework, we show state-of-the-art performance. Replacing the classical approach with learned alternatives at various levels, we then identify the reasons for why deep learned approaches do not perform well. Based on our analysis, we make recommendations for future work.

**Building Deep, Equivariant Capsule Networks**

Capsule networks are constrained by their, relative, inability to deeper in a parameter-inexpensive manner, and also by the general lack of equivariance guarantees. As a step towards bridging these two gaps, we present a new variation of capsule networks termed Space-of-Variation networks (SOVNET). Each layer in SOVNET learns to projectively represent the manifold of legal pose variations for a set of capsules, using learnable neural network – one per capsule-type. Thus, shallower capsules from a local pool predict a deeper capsule by being input into the neural network associated with the type of deeper capsule. In order to capture local object-structures better, benefit from increased parameter-sharing, and have equivariance guarantees; group-equivariant convolutions are used in the prediction mechanism. Further, a new routing algorithm based on the degree-centrality of graph nodes is presented. Experiments on affinely transformed versions of MNIST and FashionMNIST showcase the superiority of SOVNET over certain capsule-network baselines.
