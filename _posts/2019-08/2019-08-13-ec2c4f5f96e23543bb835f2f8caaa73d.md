*The Department of Chemistry, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden is seeking a PhD-student in computational science with focus on chemistry. The position is for 4 years of research including courses on graduate level. Application deadline is 2 October 2019.*

**Project description**

Food, wine and biopharma industries use in their production, from starting material to final product, multi-step chemical and biological processes, with each step being extensively complex. The difficulty to “control” the individual steps and accurately define the composition of the different raw materials and intermediate components explains partly why these processes are difficult to monitor and control. Linking what happens in the process from its starting materials up to the final product and finding clear causal relationships between most crucial factors is not an easy task, which can’t be achieved when studying each process step separately. The scientific challenge and opportunity therefore remains to study these chemical and biological processes as whole systems.

Understanding of these complex systems can be obtained by comprehensive (chemical, physical, phenotypic etc.) characterization of its steps, what creates huge amount of data. Improved multivariate algorithms, machine learning and visualization techniques are needed to enable handling of these large and complex datasets. During the project, the PhD student will develop methods that will enable modelling the combination of data sets from different platforms gathered at the same time for the same set of samples and combination of data sets from the same analytical platform but gathered at different time points. Together these results will characterize common (joint) and specific (unique) variations between these data sets, also linking to the design of experiments, for the future improvement of the production steps. The work includes development of innovative design of experiment strategies, development of new advanced data analytics tools within MVA and deep learning methodologies and development of new methods and approaches for improved interpretation and visualization of the multivariate and deep learning models.

**Qualifications**

To be admitted for studies at third-cycle level the applicant is required to have completed a second-cycle level degree, or completed course requirements of at least 240 ECTS credits, of which at least 60 ECTS credits are at second-cycle level or have an equivalent education from abroad, or equivalent qualifications.

To fulfill the specific entry requirements to be admitted for studies at third-cycle level in computational science and engineering, the applicant is required to have completed at least 90 ECTS credits in computational science and engineering courses, of which at least 30 ECTS credits shall have been acquired at second-cycle level. Computational science and engineering courses refers to courses with major quantitative, statistical or computing science elements, such as courses in computing science, mathematics and mathematical statistics, and relevant courses in biology, ecology, physics and chemistry. Applicants who in some other system either within Sweden or abroad have acquired largely equivalent skills are also eligible.

Good knowledge in English, both written and spoken, is required. The candidate must be structured, have a solution-oriented approach and an interest to learn new things, especially in Advanced Data Analytics. Very good communication skills and ability to work in a team are also requirements.

Experience with data science tools including scripting, mainly in Python is meritorious as well as experience in Design-of-Experiments and data analytics.

**Terms of employment**

The appointment aims at a PhD degree and the main task of the PhD student is to pursue their doctoral studies, which includes participation in research projects as well as postgraduate courses. In the assignments, teaching and other departmental work (up to a maximum of 20%) can be included. The employment is limited to four years full-time or up to five years when part-time teaching. The salary placement takes place according to the established salary level for doctoral employment.

**Application**

****A complete application should contain the following documents:

 

- A cover letter including a description of your research interests and motivation for applying

- A Curriculum Vitae

- Certified copies of degree certificates or equivalent, including documentation of completed academic courses and obtained grades

- Name and contact information of at least two reference persons


Applications must be submitted via our e-recruitment system. The last day to apply is**2 October 2019.**
