Working with percentages in R can be a little tricky, but it’s easy to change it to an integer, or numeric, and run the right statistics on it. Such as quartiles and mean and not frequencies. 

Essentially you are using the sub function and substituting the “%” for a blank. You don’t lose any decimals either! So in the end just remember that those are percentage amounts. 

Next example is converting to a factor

Now you can read the data as discrete. This is great for categorical and nominal level variables.

Last example is converting to numeric. If you have a variable that has a dollar sign use this to change it to a number.

I hope this helps you with your formatting times! So simple and easy and you’ll be able to summarize your data!
