**Non-parametric Behavior Clustering Inverse Reinforcement Learning** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529&is-pending-load=1)

Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is the task of learning a single reward function given a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without defining the reward function, and a set of demonstrations generated by humans/experts. However, in practice, it may be unreasonable to assume that human behaviors can be explained by one reward function since they may be inherently inconsistent. Also, demonstrations may be collected from various users and aggregated to infer and predict user’s behaviors. In this paper, we introduce the Non-parametric Behavior Clustering IRL algorithm to simultaneously cluster demonstrations and learn multiple reward functions from demonstrations that may be generated from more than one behaviors. Our method is iterative: It alternates between clustering demonstrations into different behavior clusters and inverse learning the reward functions until convergence. It is built upon the Expectation-Maximization formulation and non-parametric clustering in the IRL setting. Further, to improve the computation efficiency, we remove the need of completely solving multiple IRL problems for multiple clusters during the iteration steps and introduce a resampling technique to avoid generating too many unlikely clusters. We demonstrate the convergence and efficiency of the proposed method through learning multiple driver behaviors from demonstrations generated from a grid-world environment and continuous trajectories collected from autonomous robot cars using the Gazebo robot simulator. …

In computing, Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. Puppet is designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively. The user describes system resources and their state, either using Puppet’s declarative language or a Ruby DSL (domain-specific language). This information is stored in files called ‘Puppet manifests’. Puppet discovers the system information via a utility called Facter, and compiles the Puppet manifests into a system-specific catalog containing resources and resource dependency, which are applied against the target systems. Any actions taken by Puppet are then reported. Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, which can be either applied directly on the system, or compiled into a catalog and distributed to the target system via client-server paradigm (using a REST API), and the agent uses system specific providers to enforce the resource specified in the manifests. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages without the need to specify OS specific commands (such as rpm, yum, apt). Puppet is model-driven, requiring limited programming knowledge to use. Puppet comes in two versions, Puppet Enterprise and Open Source Puppet. In addition to providing functionalities of Open Source Puppet, Puppet Enterprise also provides GUI, API and command line tools for node management. …

In Data Mining the task of finding frequent pattern in large databases is very important and has been studied in large scale in the past few years. Unfortunately, this task is computationally expensive, especially when a large number of patterns exist. The FP-Growth Algorithm, proposed by Han in , is an efficient and scalable method for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth, using an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed and crucial information about frequent patterns named frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree). In his study, Han proved that his method outperforms other popular methods for mining frequent patterns, e.g. the Apriori Algorithm and the TreeProjection. In some later works it was proved that FP-Growth has better performance than other methods, including Eclat and Relim. The popularity and efficiency of FP-Growth Algorithm contributes with many studies that propose variations to improve his performance. …
