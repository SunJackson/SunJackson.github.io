**At: Syracuse University**![](http://feedproxy.google.com/jimg/syr-ischool.jpg)
**Location: Syracuse, NY****Web: ischool.syr.edu****Position: Four Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) Faculty Positions - Information Studies**

**Apply here**.

Syracuse University's School of Information Studies (the iSchool, ischool.syr.edu) seeks scholars and leaders to fill four Assistant Professor (tenure track) faculty positions to start in Fall 2020. Exceptional candidates may be considered at the rank of Associate or Full Professor. Successful candidates will have a productive program of research in an information-related field and be able to contribute to the development of students and courses in our degree programs in information management and technology, data science and data analytics, library and information science (including school media), and information science and technology.

The successful candidates will join our “Faculty of One”: a highly collegial environment that stresses interdisciplinary collaboration among our school's faculty and with other members of the university community and beyond. Our research and teaching often adopt a socio-technical approach, recognizing that important problems are not simply technical nor just about people, but rather require both social and technological insights. We seek applicants whose topic areas and skills adopt this philosophy, and who can speak to overlapping areas within the school.

We are specifically seeking applicants with interests in one of four areas:

Network social dynamics, including causal networks, network science, social cognition, social contagion, relationship science, social networks or group decision making (**position #074733**).
Augmented cognition, including forecasting, prediction systems, artificial intelligence, recommender systems, deep learning, data fusion, voting systems, machine learning, agent-based modeling, distributed cognition, human factors and collective behavior (**position #074725**).
Data-centered and big data approaches to innovation and entrepreneurship (**position #074726**).
Technical, behavioral and/or social approaches to address security and privacy for trustworthy cyberspace **(position #074727**).

As an integral part of this investment, Syracuse University will recruit multiple candidates for faculty positions for a cluster in the areas of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship. Faculty hired into these positions will build on our existing strengths and will participate in an organized cluster that spans the Colleges of Visual & Performing Arts, the College of Engineering & Computer Science, the Whitman School of Management, the School of Information Studies as well as the Syracuse University Libraries.

Position 4 is part of an Invest Syracuse Signature Hire Initiative to strengthen teaching and research capacity in security for trustworthy cyberspace in the School of Information Studies. Signature hires should contribute to the national and international reputation of Syracuse University and translate their success into practical, real-world action with their students.

A completed Ph.D. in a relevant field of study or the expectation of completion of the Ph.D. by August 2020 is required. The School is committed to professional development for junior faculty, and provides excellent mentoring and support.

Application: **Apply here for the specific position number listed above**.

Syracuse University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer with a strong commitment to equality of opportunity and a diverse work force. Women, military veterans, individuals with disabilities, and members of other traditionally underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply.
