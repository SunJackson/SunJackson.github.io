Launched at AWS re:Invent 2018, Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth enables you to efficiently and accurately label the datasets required to train machine learning (ML) systems. Ground Truth provides built-in labeling workflows that take human labelers step-by-step through tasks and provide tools to help them produce good results. Built-in workflows are currently available for object detection, image classification, text classification, and semantic segmentation labeling jobs.

Today, AWS launched support for a new use case: *named entity recognition* (NER). NER involves sifting through text data to locate noun phrases called *named entities,* and categorizing each with a label, such as “person,” “organization,” or “brand.” So, in the statement “I recently subscribed to Amazon Prime,” “Amazon Prime” would be the named entity and could be categorized as a “brand.”

You can broaden this use case to label longer spans of text and categorize those sequences with any pre-specified labels. For example, the following screenshot identifies spans of text in a performance review that demonstrate the Amazon leadership principle “Customer Obsession.”

## Overview

In this post, I walk you through the creation of a NER labeling job:

1. Gather a dataset.

1. Create the labeling job.

1. Select a workforce.

1. Create task instructions.


For this exercise, your NER labeling task is to identify brand names from a dataset. I have provided a sample dataset of ten tweets from the Amazon Twitter account. Alternatively, feel free to bring your own dataset, and define a specific NER labeling task that is relevant to your use case.

### Prerequisites

To follow the steps outlined in this post, you need an AWS account and access to AWS services.

### Step 1: Gather your dataset and store data in Amazon S3

Gather the dataset to label, save it to a text file, and upload the file to Amazon S3. For example, I gathered 10 tweets, saved them to a text file with one tweet per return-separated line, and uploaded the text file to an S3 bucket called “ner-blog.” For your reference, the following box contains the uploaded tweets from the text file.

### Step 2: Create a labeling job

1. In the **Amazon SageMaker** console, choose **Labeling jobs**, **Create labeling job**.

1. To set up the input dataset location, choose **Create manifest file**.

1. Point to the S3 location of the text file that you uploaded in Step 1, and select **Text**, **Create**.

After the creation process finishes, choose **Use this manifest**, and complete the following fields: 
 
1. **Job name**—Custom value.

1. **Input dataset location**—S3 location of the text file to label. (The previous step should have populated this field.)

1. **Output dataset location**—S3 location to which Amazon SageMaker sends labels and job metadata.

1. **IAM Role**—A role that has read and write permissions for this task’s **Input dataset** and **Output dataset** locations in S3.

 
1. Under **Task type**, for**Task Category**, choose **Text**.

1. For **Task selection**, select **Named entity recognition**.


### Step 3: Selecting a labeling workforce

The **Workers** interface offers three **Worker types**:

The console includes other **Workers** settings, including **Price per task** and the optional **Number of workers per dataset**.

For this demo, use **Public**. Set **Price per task** at $0.024. Mechanical Turk workers should complete the relatively straightforward task of identifying brands in a tweet in 5–7 seconds.

Use the default value for **Number of workers per dataset object** (in this case, a single tweet), which is 3. SageMaker Ground Truth asks three workers to label each tweet and then consolidates those three workers’ responses into one high-fidelity label. To learn more about consolidation approaches, see Annotation Consolidation.

### Step 4: Creating the labeling task instructions

While critically important, effective labeling instructions often require significant iteration and experimentation. To learn about best practices for creating high-quality instructions, see Create high-quality instructions for Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth labeling jobs. Our exercise focuses on identifying brand names in tweets. If there are no brand names in a specific tweet, the labeler has the option of indicating there are no brands in the tweet.

An example of labeling instructions is shown on the following screenshot.

## Conclusion

In this post, I introduced Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth data labeling. I showed you how to gather a dataset, create a NER labeling job, select a workforce, create instructions, and launch the job. This is a small labeling job with only 10 tweets and should be completed within one hour by Mechanical Turk workers. Visit the AWS Management Console to get started.
