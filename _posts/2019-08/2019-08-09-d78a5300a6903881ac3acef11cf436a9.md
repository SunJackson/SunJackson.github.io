The Problem
There’s one thing about R that a lot of people have as their Top-of-Mind. That’s the black-and-white plot of `iris` dataset which is definitely a huge boring view of R. That’s boring because of aesthetics but also because it’s such a cliched example used over and over again. The other problem is finding the right set of dataset for the right set of problem you want to teach/learn/experiment. Let’s say you want to teach Time Series and that’s a case where your Spam / Ham Classification Dataset isn’t going to be of any use.

### Solution

No more worries. That’s where `fakir` has arrived to help us. `fakir` is an R-package by **Colin Fay** (of Think-R) who’s been so good with his contributions to the R community.

### About fakir

As in the documentation, The goal of `fakir` is to provide fake datasets that can be used to teach R.

### Installation and Loading

`fakir` can be installed from Github (`fakir` isn’t available on CRAN yet)

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ThinkR-open/fakir")
```

```
library(fakir)
```

### Use-case: Clickstream / Web Data

Clickstream / Web Data is one thing a lot of organizations use in analytics these days but it’s hard to get your hand on some clickstream data since no company would prefer sharing theirs. There’s a sample Data on Google Analytics Test Account but that may not serve you any purpose in learning Data science in R or R’s ecosystem.

This is a typical case where `fakir` can help you

```
library(tidyverse)
fakir::fake_visits() %>% head()
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 8
## timestamp year month day home about blog contact
## 
## 1 2017-01-01 2017 1 1 352 176 521 NA
## 2 2017-01-02 2017 1 2 203 115 492 89
## 3 2017-01-03 2017 1 3 103 59 549 NA
## 4 2017-01-04 2017 1 4 484 113 633 331
## 5 2017-01-05 2017 1 5 438 138 423 227
## 6 2017-01-06 2017 1 6 NA 75 478 289
```

That’s how simple is to get a sample Clickstream (tidy) data with `fakir`. Another good thing to mention is, If you look at the `fake_visits()` documentation, You’ll find it that there’s an argument that takes `seed` value which means, you are in control of randomizing the data and reproducing them.

```
fake_visits(from = "2017-01-01", to = "2017-12-31", local = c("en_US", "fr_FR"), 
 seed = 2811) %>% head()
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 8
## timestamp year month day home about blog contact
## 
## 1 2017-01-01 2017 1 1 352 176 521 NA
## 2 2017-01-02 2017 1 2 203 115 492 89
## 3 2017-01-03 2017 1 3 103 59 549 NA
## 4 2017-01-04 2017 1 4 484 113 633 331
## 5 2017-01-05 2017 1 5 438 138 423 227
## 6 2017-01-06 2017 1 6 NA 75 478 289
```

### Use-case: French Data

Also, in the above usage of `fake_visits()` function you might have noticed another attribute `local` which can help you select `French` data instead of English. In my personal opinion, This is crucial if you are on a mission of improving Data Literacy or Democratising Data Science.

```
fake_ticket_client(vol = 10, local = "fr_FR") %>% head()
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 25
## ref num_client prenom nom job age region id_dpt departement
## 
## 1 DOSS… 31 Const… Boul… 62 Pays … 44 Loire-Atla…
## 2 DOSS… 79 Martin Norm… Cons… 52 Alsace 67 Bas-Rhin 
## 3 DOSS… 65 Phili… Géra… 28 Poito… 86 Vienne 
## 4 DOSS… 77 Simon… Cour… Plom… 29 Île-d… 91 
## 5 DOSS… 59 Rémy Dela… 18 Picar… 02 Aisne 
## 6 DOSS… 141 Astrid Dumo… Ingé… 35 Nord-… 62 Pas-de-Cal…
## # … with 16 more variables: gestionnaire_cb , nom_complet ,
## # entry_date , points_fidelite , priorite_encodee ,
## # priorite , timestamp , annee , mois , jour ,
## # pris_en_charge , pris_en_charge_code , type ,
## # type_encoded , etat , source_appel 
```

In the above example, We’ve used another function `fake_ticket_client()` of fakir that helps us in giving a typical ticket dataset (like the one you get from **ServiceNow** or **Zendesk**)

### Use-case: Scatter Plot

So, the rant that I made at the start of this post about `iris` (Don’t mistake me: I’ve got huge respect for the scientists who created this dataset, it’s just that the wrong / over-usage of it which I don’t appreciate), Now we can overcome with `fakir`’s datasets.

```
fake_visits() %>% 
 ggplot() + geom_point(aes(blog,about, color = as.factor(month)))
```

```
## Warning: Removed 47 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

(Perhaps, Not a good scatter plot to show Correlation but hey, you can teach scatter plot without plotting Petal Length and Sepal Length)

### Summary

If you are in the business of teaching or likes experimenting and don’t want to use cliched datasets, `fakir` is a very nice package to get to know. As the author of `fakir`’s package mentions in the description, `charlatan` is another such R-package that helps in generating meaningful fake data.
