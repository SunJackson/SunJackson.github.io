Yesterday I released an ebook on Leanpub,called *Modern R with the tidyverse*, which you can alsoread for free here.

In this blog post, I want to give some context.

*Modern R with the tidyverse* is the second ebook I release on Leanpub. I released the first one, calledFunctional programming and unit testing for data munging with R aroundChristmas 2016 (I’ve retired it on Leanpub, but you can still read it for freehere) . I just had moved back to my home country ofLuxembourg and started a new job as a research assistant at the statistical national institute.Since then, lots of things happened; I’ve changed jobs and joined PwC Luxembourg as a data scientist,was promoted to manager, finished my PhD, and most importantly of all, I became a father.

Through all this, I continued blogging and working on a new ebook, called *Modern R with the tidyverse*.At first, this was supposed to be a separate book from the first one, but as I continued writing,I realized that updating and finishing the first one, would take a lot of effort, and also, thatit wouldn’t make much sense in keeping both separated. So I decided to merge the content from thefirst ebook with the second, and update everything in one go.

My very first notes were around 50 pages if memory serves, and I used them to teach R at theUniversity of Strasbourg while I employed there as a research and teaching assistant and workingon my PhD. These notes were the basis of *Functional programming and unit testing for data munging with R*and now *Modern R*. Chapter 2 of *Modern R* is almost a simple copy and paste from these notes(with more sections added). These notes were first written around 2012-2013ish.

*Modern R* is the kind of text I would like to have had when I first started playing around with R,sometime around 2009-2010. It starts from the beginning, but also goes quite into details in thelater chapters. For instance, the section onmodeling with functional programmingis quite advanced, but I believe that readers that read through all the book and reached that partwould be armed with all the needed knowledge to follow. At least, this is my hope.

Now, the book is still not finished. Two chapters are missing, but it should not take me long tofinish them as I already have drafts lying around. However, exercises might still be in wrongplaces, and more are required. Also, generally, more polishing is needed.

As written in the first paragraph of this section, the book is available onLeanpub. Unlike my previous ebook, this one costs money;a minimum price of 4.99$ and a recommended price of 14.99$, but as mentioned you can read it forfree online. I’ve hesitated to give it a minimum price of0$, but I figured that since the book can be read for free online, and that Leanpub has a 45 daysreturn policy where readers can get 100% reimbursed, no questions asked (and keep the downloadedebook), readers were not taking a lot of risks by buying it for 5 bucks. I sure hope however thatreaders will find that this ebook is worth at least 5 bucks!

Now why should you read it? There’s already a lot of books on learning how to use R. Well, I don’treally want to convince you to read it. But some people do seem to like my style of writing and myblog posts, so I guess these same people, or similar people, might like the ebook. Also, I thinkthat this ebook covers a lot of different topics, enough of them to make you an efficient R user.But as I’ve written in the introduction of *Modern R*:

*So what you can expect from this book is that this book is not the only one you should read.*

Anyways, hope you’ll enjoy *Modern R*, suggestions, criticisms and reviews welcome!

By the way, the cover of the book is a painting by John William Waterhouse,depicting Diogenes of Sinope,an ancient Greek philosopher, and absolute mad lad. Read his Wikipedia page, it’s worth it.
