This blog post is an excerpt of my ebook Modern R with the tidyverse that you can read for freehere.This is taken from Chapter 8, in which I discuss advanced functional programming methods formodeling.

As written just above (note: as written above *in the book*), `map()` simply applies a functionto a list of inputs, and in the previoussection we mapped `ggplot()` to generate many plots at once. This approach can also be used tomap any modeling functions, for instance `lm()` to a list of datasets.

For instance, suppose that you wish to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. Suppose that you aredealing with a binary choice problem; usually, you would use a logistic regression for this.

However, in certain disciplines, especially in the social sciences, the so-called Linear ProbabilityModel is often used as well. The LPM is a simple linear regression, but unlike the standard settingof a linear regression, the dependent variable, or target, is a binary variable, and not a continuousvariable. Before you yell “Wait, that’s illegal”, you should know that in practice LPMs do a goodjob of estimating marginal effects, which is what social scientists and econometricians are ofteninterested in. Marginal effects are another way of interpreting models, giving how the outcome(or the target) changes given a change in a independent variable (or a feature). For instance,a marginal effect of 0.10 for age would mean that probability of success would increase by 10% foreach added year of age.

There has been a lot of discussion on logistic regression vs LPMs, and there are pros and consof using LPMs. Micro-econometricians are still fond of LPMs, even though the pros of LPMs arenot really convincing. However, quoting Angrist and Pischke:

“While a nonlinear model may fit the CEF (population conditional expectation function) for LDVs(limited dependent variables) more closely than a linear model, when it comes to marginal effects,this probably matters little” (source: *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*)

so LPMs are still used for estimating marginal effects.

Let us check this assessment with one example. First, we simulate some data, thenrun a logistic regression and compute the marginal effects, and then compare with a LPM:

```
set.seed(1234)
x1 <- rnorm(100)
x2 <- rnorm(100)
 
z <- .5 + 2*x1 + 4*x2

p <- 1/(1 + exp(-z))

y <- rbinom(100, 1, p)

df <- tibble(y = y, x1 = x1, x2 = x2)
```

This data generating process generates data from a binary choice model. Fitting the model using alogistic regression allows us to recover the structural parameters:

```
logistic_regression <- glm(y ~ ., data = df, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
```

Let’s see a summary of the model fit:

```
summary(logistic_regression)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## glm(formula = y ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = df)
## 
## Deviance Residuals: 
## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max 
## -2.91941 -0.44872 0.00038 0.42843 2.55426 
##

## x2 3.6582 0.8059 4.539 5.64e-06 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)
## 
## Null deviance: 138.629 on 99 degrees of freedom
## Residual deviance: 60.576 on 97 degrees of freedom
## AIC: 66.576
## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 7
```

We do recover the parameters that generated the data, but what about the marginal effects? We canget the marginal effects easily using the `{margins}` package:

```
library(margins)

margins(logistic_regression)
```

```
## Average marginal effects
```

```
## glm(formula = y ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = df)
```

```
## x1 x2
## 0.1598 0.3516
```

Or, even better, we can compute the *true* marginal effects, since we know the datagenerating process:

```
meffects <- function(dataset, coefs){
 X <- dataset %>% 
 select(-y) %>% 
 as.matrix()
 
 dydx_x1 <- mean(dlogis(X%*%c(coefs[2], coefs[3]))*coefs[2])
 dydx_x2 <- mean(dlogis(X%*%c(coefs[2], coefs[3]))*coefs[3])
 
 tribble(~term, ~true_effect,
 "x1", dydx_x1,
 "x2", dydx_x2)
}

(true_meffects <- meffects(df, c(0.5, 2, 4)))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
## term true_effect
## 
## 1 x1 0.175
## 2 x2 0.350
```

Ok, so now what about using this infamous Linear Probability Model to estimate the marginal effects?

```
lpm <- lm(y ~ ., data = df)

summary(lpm)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ ., data = df)
## 
## Residuals:
## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max 
## -0.83953 -0.31588 -0.02885 0.28774 0.77407 
## 
## Coefficients:

## x1 0.16771 0.03545 4.732 7.58e-06 ***
## x2 0.31250 0.03449 9.060 1.43e-14 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 0.3541 on 97 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared: 0.5135, Adjusted R-squared: 0.5034 
## F-statistic: 51.18 on 2 and 97 DF, p-value: 6.693e-16
```

It’s not too bad, but maybe it could have been better in other circumstances. Perhaps if we had moreobservations, or perhaps for a different set of structural parameters the results of the LPMwould have been closer. The LPM estimates the marginal effect of `x1` to be0.1677134 vs 0.1597956for the logistic regression and for `x2`, the LPM estimation is 0.3124966vs 0.351607. The *true* marginal effects are0.1750963 and 0.3501926 for `x1` and `x2` respectively.

Just as to assess the accuracy of a model data scientists perform cross-validation, a Monte Carlostudy can be performed to asses how close the estimation of the marginal effects using a LPM isto the marginal effects derived from a logistic regression. It will allow us to test with datasetsof different sizes, and generated using different structural parameters.

First, let’s write a function that generates data. The function below generates 10 datasets of size100 (the code is inspired by this StackExchange answer):

```
generate_datasets <- function(coefs = c(.5, 2, 4), sample_size = 100, repeats = 10){

 generate_one_dataset <- function(coefs, sample_size){
 x1 <- rnorm(sample_size)
 x2 <- rnorm(sample_size)
 
 z <- coefs[1] + coefs[2]*x1 + coefs[3]*x2

 p <- 1/(1 + exp(-z))

 y <- rbinom(sample_size, 1, p)

 df <- tibble(y = y, x1 = x1, x2 = x2)
 }

 simulations <- rerun(.n = repeats, generate_one_dataset(coefs, sample_size))
 
 tibble("coefs" = list(coefs), "sample_size" = sample_size, "repeats" = repeats, "simulations" = list(simulations))
}
```

Let’s first generate one dataset:

```
one_dataset <- generate_datasets(repeats = 1)
```

Let’s take a look at `one_dataset`:

```
one_dataset
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
## coefs sample_size repeats simulations
## 
## 1 100 1 
```

As you can see, the tibble with the simulated data is inside a list-column called `simulations`.Let’s take a closer look:

```
str(one_dataset$simulations)
```

```
## List of 1
## $ :List of 1
## ..$ :Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame': 100 obs. of 3 variables:
## .. ..$ y : int [1:100] 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 ...
## .. ..$ x1: num [1:100] 0.437 1.06 0.452 0.663 -1.136 ...
## .. ..$ x2: num [1:100] -2.316 0.562 -0.784 -0.226 -1.587 ...
```

The structure is quite complex, and it’s important to understand this, because it will have animpact on the next lines of code; it is a list, containing a list, containing a dataset! No worriesthough, we can still map over the datasets directly, by using `modify_depth()` instead of `map()`.

Now, let’s fit a LPM and compare the estimation of the marginal effects with the *true* marginaleffects. In order to have some confidence in our results,we will not simply run a linear regression on that single dataset, but will instead simulate hundreds,then thousands and ten of thousands of data sets, get the marginal effects and comparethem to the true ones (but here I won’t simulate more than 500 datasets).

Let’s first generate 10 datasets:

```
many_datasets <- generate_datasets()
```

Now comes the tricky part. I have this object, `many_datasets` looking like this:

```
many_datasets
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 4
## coefs sample_size repeats simulations
## 
## 1 100 10 
```

I would like to fit LPMs to the 10 datasets. For this, I will need to use all the power of functionalprogramming and the `{tidyverse}`. I will be adding columns to this data frame using `mutate()`and mapping over the `simulations` list-column using `modify_depth()`. The list of data frames isat the second level (remember, it’s a list containing a list containing data frames).

I’ll start by fitting the LPMs, then using `broom::tidy()` I will get a nice data frame of theestimated parameters. I will then only select what I need, and then bind the rows of all thedata frames. I will do the same for the *true* marginal effects.

I highly suggest that you run the following lines, one after another. It is complicated to understandwhat’s going on if you are not used to such workflows. However, I hope to convince you that onceit will click, it’ll be much more intuitive than doing all this inside a loop. Here’s the code:

```
results <- many_datasets %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(simulations, 2, ~lm(y ~ ., data = .x))) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(lpm, 2, broom::tidy)) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(lpm, 2, ~select(., term, estimate))) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(lpm, 2, ~filter(., term != "(Intercept)"))) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = map(lpm, bind_rows)) %>% 
 mutate(true_effect = modify_depth(simulations, 2, ~meffects(., coefs = coefs[[1]]))) %>% 
 mutate(true_effect = map(true_effect, bind_rows))
```

This is how results looks like:

```
results
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 6
## coefs sample_size repeats simulations lpm true_effect 
## 
## 1 100 10 
```

Let’s take a closer look to the `lpm` and `true_effect` columns:

```
results$lpm
```

```
## [[1]]
## # A tibble: 20 x 2
## term estimate
## 
## 1 x1 0.228
## 2 x2 0.353
## 3 x1 0.180
## 4 x2 0.361
## 5 x1 0.165
## 6 x2 0.374
## 7 x1 0.182
## 8 x2 0.358
## 9 x1 0.125
## 10 x2 0.345
## 11 x1 0.171
## 12 x2 0.331
## 13 x1 0.122
## 14 x2 0.309
## 15 x1 0.129
## 16 x2 0.332
## 17 x1 0.102
## 18 x2 0.374
## 19 x1 0.176
## 20 x2 0.410
```

```
results$true_effect
```

```
## [[1]]
## # A tibble: 20 x 2
## term true_effect
## 
## 1 x1 0.183
## 2 x2 0.366
## 3 x1 0.166
## 4 x2 0.331
## 5 x1 0.174
## 6 x2 0.348
## 7 x1 0.169
## 8 x2 0.339
## 9 x1 0.167
## 10 x2 0.335
## 11 x1 0.173
## 12 x2 0.345
## 13 x1 0.157
## 14 x2 0.314
## 15 x1 0.170
## 16 x2 0.340
## 17 x1 0.182
## 18 x2 0.365
## 19 x1 0.161
## 20 x2 0.321
```

Let’s bind the columns, and compute the difference between the *true* and estimated marginaleffects:

```
simulation_results <- results %>% 
 mutate(difference = map2(.x = lpm, .y = true_effect, bind_cols)) %>% 
 mutate(difference = map(difference, ~mutate(., difference = true_effect - estimate))) %>% 
 mutate(difference = map(difference, ~select(., term, difference))) %>% 
 pull(difference) %>% 
 .[[1]]
```

Let’s take a look at the simulation results:

```
simulation_results %>% 
 group_by(term) %>% 
 summarise(mean = mean(difference), 
 sd = sd(difference))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 0.0122 0.0370
## 2 x2 -0.0141 0.0306
```

Already with only 10 simulated datasets, the difference in means is not significant. Let’s rerunthe analysis, but for difference sizes. In order to make things easier, we can put all the codeinto a nifty function:

```
monte_carlo <- function(coefs, sample_size, repeats){
 many_datasets <- generate_datasets(coefs, sample_size, repeats)
 
 results <- many_datasets %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(simulations, 2, ~lm(y ~ ., data = .x))) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(lpm, 2, broom::tidy)) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(lpm, 2, ~select(., term, estimate))) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = modify_depth(lpm, 2, ~filter(., term != "(Intercept)"))) %>% 
 mutate(lpm = map(lpm, bind_rows)) %>% 
 mutate(true_effect = modify_depth(simulations, 2, ~meffects(., coefs = coefs[[1]]))) %>% 
 mutate(true_effect = map(true_effect, bind_rows))

 simulation_results <- results %>% 
 mutate(difference = map2(.x = lpm, .y = true_effect, bind_cols)) %>% 
 mutate(difference = map(difference, ~mutate(., difference = true_effect - estimate))) %>% 
 mutate(difference = map(difference, ~select(., term, difference))) %>% 
 pull(difference) %>% 
 .[[1]]

 simulation_results %>% 
 group_by(term) %>% 
 summarise(mean = mean(difference), 
 sd = sd(difference))
}
```

And now, let’s run the simulation for different parameters and sizes:

```
monte_carlo(c(.5, 2, 4), 100, 10)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 -0.00826 0.0291
## 2 x2 -0.00732 0.0412
```

```
monte_carlo(c(.5, 2, 4), 100, 100)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 0.00360 0.0392
## 2 x2 0.00517 0.0446
```

```
monte_carlo(c(.5, 2, 4), 100, 500)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 -0.00152 0.0371
## 2 x2 -0.000701 0.0423
```

```
monte_carlo(c(pi, 6, 9), 100, 10)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 -0.00829 0.0546
## 2 x2 0.00178 0.0370
```

```
monte_carlo(c(pi, 6, 9), 100, 100)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 0.0107 0.0608
## 2 x2 0.00831 0.0804
```

```
monte_carlo(c(pi, 6, 9), 100, 500)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## term mean sd
## 
## 1 x1 0.00879 0.0522
## 2 x2 0.0113 0.0668
```

We see that, at least for this set of parameters, the LPM does a good job of estimating marginaleffects.

Now, this study might in itself not be very interesting to you, but I believe the general approachis quite useful and flexible enough to be adapted to all kinds of use-cases.
