## Introductory Course

- The introductory course will be taught by Dan Holmes, MD of the University of British Columbia and Will Slade, PhD of Laboratory Corporation of America.

- Course description is here


## Intermediate/Advanced Course

## Registration

- Although the conference is for clinical mass spectrometry, the courses are generic in nature and generally geared towards the biological and health sciences rather than mass spectometry *per se*.

- You do not need to register for the conference to attend the pre-conference courses.

- Academic rates apply. Registration for the course includes lots of snacks and coffee… like, good coffee.

- Registration details are here.


## Details
