I am excited to announce `vtreat` is now available for `Python` on PyPi, in addition for `R` on CRAN.




`vtreat` is:

> 

A `data.frame` processor/conditioner that prepares real-world data for predictive modeling in a statistically sound manner. `vtreat` prepares variables so that data has fewer exceptional cases, making it easier to safely use models in production. Common problems `vtreat` defends against: `Inf`, `NA`, too many categorical levels, rare categorical levels, and new categorical levels (levels seen during application, but not during training). Reference: “`vtreat`: a data.frame Processor for Predictive Modeling”, Zumel, Mount, 2016.

To help you get up to speed we have a number of short worked examples of supervised machine learning using `vtreat` here. For instance here we work the KDD2009 example.

Let’s hear it for cross-language data science!
