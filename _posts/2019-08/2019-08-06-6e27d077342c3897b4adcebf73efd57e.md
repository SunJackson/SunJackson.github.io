We just released *mlr* v2.15.0 to CRAN.This version includes some breaking changes and the usual bug fixes from the last three months.

We made good progress on the goal of cleaning up the Github repo.We processed nearly all open pull requests (around 40).In the next months we will focus on cleaning up the issue tracker even though most of our time will go into improving the successor package mlr3 and its extension packages.

Unless there are active contributions from the user side, we do not expect much feature additions for the next version(s) of *mlr*.

The `benchmark()` function does not store the tuning results (stored in the `$extract` slot) anymore by default.This change was made to prevent BenchmarkResult (BMR) objects from getting huge in size (~ GB) when multiple models are compared with extensive tuning.Unless you want to do a analysis on the tuning effects, you do not need the tuning results to compare the performance of the algorithms.Huge BMR objects can cause various troubles.One of them (which was the inital root for this change) appears when benchmarking is done on a HPC using multiple workers.Each worker has a limited amount of memory and expecting a huge BMR might limit the amount of workers that can be spawned.In addition, loading the large resulting BMR into the global environment (or merging it using `mergeBenchmarkResults()`) for post-analysis will become a pain.To save users from all of these troubles in the first place, we decided to change the default.

To store the tuning results, you have to actively set `keep.extract = TRUE` from now on.Not storing the tuning was actually already implicitly the default in `resample()` since the user had to set the `extract` argument manually to save certain results (tuning, feature importance).With the new change the package became more consistent.
