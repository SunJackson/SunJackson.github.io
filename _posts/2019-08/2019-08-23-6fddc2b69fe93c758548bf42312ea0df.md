 Why R? pre-meetings are R meetups that support local R groups. They promote Why R? 2019 Conference.

The purpose of those meetings is to provide the space for the professional networking and knowledge exchange, between practitioners and students, from the area of statistical machine learning, programming, optimization and data science fields.

We managed to co-organize already 12 R meetups around Central-Eastern Europe, among others in Warsaw, Prague, Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Wroclaw. We often provide beverages and pizza, cover transportation and accomodation costs for speakers and pay for the after party. Thanks to those meetings we had a chance to understand needs and areas of interest of R users around the Europe.

*Those meetings would not happen without the help, time and the energy that local R hosts invested in this project!*

If you’d like to organize R meetup in your city, and are looking for the support to cover snacks or transport for the speakers, do not hesitate to contact us under kontakt_at_whyr.pl We would be more than happy to brainstorm the potential use case for presentations, share ideas for the networking and suggest speakers in your close region.

Why R? pre-meetings also promote Why R? 2019 Conference that will be held between 26-29 September in Warsaw. Check out prices for tickets below.
