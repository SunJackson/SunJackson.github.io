It’s only been a couple days since the initial version of my revamped take on RSwitch but there have been numerous improvements since then worth mentioning.

For starters, there’s a new app icon that uses the blue and gray from the official (modern) R logo to help visually associate it with R:

In similar fashion, the menubar icon now looks better in dark mode (I may still tweak it a bit, tho).

There are also some new features in the menu bar from v1.0.0:

- numbered shortcuts for each R version

- handy menubar links to R resources on the internet

- two menubar links to make it easier to download the latest RStudio dailies by hand (if you’re not using something like Homebrew already for that) and the latest R-devel macOS distribution tarball

- saner/cleaner alerts


On tap for 1.4.0 is using Notification Center for user messaging vs icky alerts and, perhaps, some TouchBar icons for Mac folk with capable MacBook Pro models.

### FIN

As usual, kick the tyres & file issues, questions, feature requests & PRs where you like.
