Earlier this year, I released a simple R package (available at basilesimon/noaastorms) that downloads, cleans and parses NOAA IBtrack data for you.

As the NOAA updated its datasets, `noaastorms` is now using these!

## How to install

```
library(devtools)
install_github("basilesimon/noaastorms")

```

## Available functions

`getStorms`: Fetch NOAA historical best track storms data

```
> df <- getStorms(c('EP'))

> head(df[1:5])
 Serial_Num Season Num Basin Sub_basin Name
2 1902276N14266 1902 01 EP MM UNNAMED
3 1902276N14266 1902 01 EP MM UNNAMED
4 1902276N14266 1902 01 EP MM UNNAMED
5 1902276N14266 1902 01 EP MM UNNAMED
6 1902276N14266 1902 01 EP MM UNNAMED

```

The first argument is a vector of basin codes from this list:

- NA: North Atlantic

- SA: South Atlantic

- NI: North Indian

- SI: South Indian

- EP: East Pacific

- SP: South Pacific

- WP: West Pacific

To get storms that took place in the Atlantic for example, run `getStorms(c('NA', 'SA'))`.

The second (optional) argument is a date range to filter data with. For example:

```
dateRange <- c(as.Date('2010-01-01'), as.Date('2012-12-31'))
getStorms(c('NA', 'SA'), dateRange = dateRange)

```

Will query storms that took place in the Atlantic in 2010 and 2012.

## Usage

```
# load a map of the world and
# use `clipPolys` to avoid issues
# when zooming in with `coord_map`
wm <- map_data("world")
library("PBSmapping")
data.table::setnames(wm, c("X","Y","PID","POS","region","subregion"))
worldmap <- clipPolys(wm,
 xlim=c(20,110),ylim=c(0, 45),
 keepExtra=TRUE)

# load storms for the Atlantic ocean
spStorms <- getStorms(c('NA', 'SA'))

ggplot(spStorms,
 aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude,
 group = Serial_Num)) + 
 geom_polygon(data = worldmap,
 aes(x = X, y = Y, group = PID), 
 fill = "whitesmoke",
 colour = "gray10",
 size = 0.2) +
 geom_path(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.8,
 color = "red") +
 coord_map(xlim = c(20,110),
 ylim = c(0, 45)) 

```

#### Official changelog (retrieved Aug 16, 2019)

[https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=status][https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=status]

This is the first release of IBTrACS version 04. It is updated weekly.Release date: March 2019

New features (improvements from v03):* Best track data updated daily and contain provisional tracks of recent storms.* Reduced formats – Version 4 is available in 3 formats (netCDF, CSV, shapefiles)* Consistent formats – The data presented in each format is completely interconsistent (identical).* More parameters – More parameters provided by the agencies are provided in IBTrACS* Basin assignment – Any system occuring in a basin is included in that basin file (in version 3, the storm was only included in the basin in which it had its genesis)* New derived parameters – We provide storm translation speed and direction and other variables requested by users.
