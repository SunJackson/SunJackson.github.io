The sparklyr package is an R *interface* to Apache Spark. The meaning of the word interface is very important in this context as the way we use this interface can significantly affect the performance benefits we get from using Spark.

To understand the meaning of the above a bit better, we will examine 3 very simple functions that are different in implementation but intend to provide the same results, and how they behave with regards to Spark. We will use datasets from the nycflights13 package for our examples.

## An R function translated to Spark SQL

Using the following `fun_implemented()` function will yield the expected results for both a local data frame `nycflights13::weather` and the remote Spark object referenced by `tbl_weather`:

```
# An R function translated to Spark SQL
fun_implemented <- function(df, col) {
{% raw %}
 df %>% mutate({{col}} := tolower({{col}}))
{% endraw %}
}
```

```
fun_implemented(nycflights13::weather, origin)
fun_implemented(tbl_weather, origin)
```

This is because the R function `tolower` was translated by `dbplyr` to Spark SQL function `LOWER` and the resulting query was sent to Spark to be executed. We can see the actual translated SQL by running `sql_render()` on the function call:

```
dbplyr::sql_render(
 fun_implemented(tbl_weather, origin)
)
```

```
 SELECT LOWER(`origin`) AS `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`,
`temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`,
`pressure`, `visib`, `time_hour`
FROM `weather`
```

## An R function not translated to Spark SQL

Using the following `fun_r_only()` function will only yield the expected results for a local data frame `nycflights13::weather`. For the remote Spark object referenced by `tbl_weather` we will get an error:

```
# An R function not translated to Spark SQL
fun_r_only <- function(df, col) {
{% raw %}
 df %>% mutate({{col}} := casefold({{col}}, upper = FALSE))
{% endraw %}
}
```

```
fun_r_only(nycflights13::weather, origin)
fun_r_only(tbl_weather, origin)
```

```
 Error: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException: 
mismatched input 'AS' expecting ')'(line 1, pos 32)

== SQL ==
SELECT casefold(`origin`, FALSE AS `upper`) AS `origin`, 
`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, 
`temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, 
`precip`, `pressure`, `visib`, `time_hour`
--------------------------------^^^
FROM `weather`
```

This is because there simply is no translation provided by dbplyr for the `casefold()` function. The generated Spark SQL will therefore not be valid and throw an error once the Spark SQL parser tries to parse it.

## A Hive built-in function not existing in R

On the other hand, using the below `fun_hive_builtin()` function will only yield the expected results for the remote Spark object referenced by `tbl_weather`. For the local data frame `nycflights13::weather` we will get an error:

```
# A Hive built-in function not existing in R
fun_hive_builtin <- function(df, col) {
{% raw %}
 df %>% mutate({{col}} := lower({{col}}))
{% endraw %}
}
```

```
fun_hive_builtin(tbl_weather, origin)
fun_hive_builtin(nycflights13::weather, origin)
```

```
Error: Evaluation error: could not find function "lower".
```

This is because the function `lower` does not exist in R itself. For a non-existing R function there obviously is no dbplyr translation either. In this case, dbplyr keeps it as-is when translating to SQL, and the SQL will be valid and executed without problems because `lower` is, in fact, a function built-in to Hive:

```
dbplyr::sql_render(fun_hive_builtin(tbl_weather, origin))
```

```
 SELECT lower(`origin`) AS `origin`,
`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`,
`temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`,
`precip`, `pressure`, `visib`, `time_hour`
FROM `weather`
```
