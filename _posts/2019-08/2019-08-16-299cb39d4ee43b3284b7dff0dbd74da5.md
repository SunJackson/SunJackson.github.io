### 
Job: Several postdocs, Ground Breaking Deep Learning Technology for Monitoring the Brain during Surgery with Commercialization Opportunity, University of Pittsburgh



Kayhan just sent me the following:



> 
Dear Igor,

I hope you are doing well.

I don't know if you remember me but we have been in contact a few times while I was a Ph.D. student at UPenn.

My lab at the University of Pittsburgh has several postdoc positions open. More specifically, I would be thankful if you could advertise this position (Link: https://kayhan.dbmi.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/JobAd.pdf) to your audience.

Best,Kayhan

Ground Breaking Deep Learning Technology for Monitoring the Brain during Surgery
with Commercialization Opportunity 

> 
We are developing a clinical tool based on deep learning to automatically detect stroke during surgery and alert
the surgical team to avert complications and save lives. We are uniquely positioned at the intersection of the
largest health care system in the US, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and top ranked
academic institutions, the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
Our group consists of Pitt and UPMC faculty members who have complementary expertise in machine learning
and in healthcare and specifically in deep learning, clinical informatics, neurology, and surgery. We develop
novel deep learning and other machine learning methods for application to challenging clinical problems. We
are very well funded by NIH, NSF, industry, and internal institutional grants.  

> 
In the current project, we are developing a clinical tool that will automatically detect stroke and other adverse
events during surgery from an array of monitoring information, and provide highly accurate real time alerts to
the surgical team to make course corrections during surgery. The clinical tool is to be deployed in operating
rooms for monitoring surgeries and providing high quality alerts.The successful candidate will work with us in a highly collaborative environment that spans the computer
laboratory and the operating room and will gain unique and valuable experience in deep learning, development
of a tool for a clinical setting, and in commercialization.  

> 
Expected qualifications
Genuinely motivated to develop and apply machine learning to clinical problems. Strong expertise in machine
learning is required; expertise in statistics and experience with messy clinical data is a plus. Python fluency is
required. Demonstrated ability to make meaningful contributions to projects with a research flavor is valuable.  

> 
Experience/Abilities• Hands-on experience building predictive models• Experience working with diverse data types including signal and structured data; experience with text data
is a plus• Experience in programming in Python; experience in additional languages (R, C/C++) is a plus• Aware of current best practices in machine learning• Fluency in one of the deep learning frameworks is a plus (PyTorch or Tensorflow)• Knowledge of statistics, including hypothesis testing with parametric and non-parametric tests and basic
probability• PhD in computer science, electrical engineering, statistics or equivalent computational / quantitative fields
(exceptional MS candidates will be considered)  

> 
The goal of this project is to develop, evaluate and commercialize a tool for automatic detection of stroke
during surgery. The successful candidate will have the rare opportunity to perform cutting-edge deep learning
research and participate in a commercial endeavor.  

>
