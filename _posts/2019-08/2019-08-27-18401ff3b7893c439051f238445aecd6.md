***Computes the Scores for Different Implicit Measures*** (**implicitMeasures**)A tool for computing the scores for the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz (1998) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464>) and the Single Category-IAT (SC-IAT: Karpinski & Steinman (2006) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.91.1.16>). Functions for preparing the data (both for the IAT and the SC-IAT), plotting the results, and obtaining a table with the scores of implicit measures descriptive statistics are provided.

***Core Tools for Packages in the ‘fable’ Framework*** (**fabletools**)Provides tools, helpers and data structures for developing models and time series functions for ‘fable’ and extension packages. These tools support a consistent and tidy interface for time series modelling and analysis.

***Expressions with Statistical Details*** (**statsExpressions**)Statistical processing backend for ‘ggstatsplot’, this package creates expressions with details from statistical tests. Currently, it supports only the most common types of statistical tests: parametric, nonparametric, robust, and bayesian versions of t-test/anova, correlation analyses, contingency table analysis, and regression analyses.

***Methods for Calculating the Loreau & Hector 2001 BEF Partition*** (**partitionBEFsp**)A collection of functions that can be used to estimate selection and complementarity effects, sensu Loreau & Hector (2001) <doi:10.1038/35083573>, even in cases where data are only available for a random subset of species (i.e. incomplete sample-level data). A full derivation and explanation of the statistical corrections used here is available in Clark et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13285>.
