***Feature Extraction And Statistics for Time Series*** (**feasts**)Provides a collection of features, decompositions, statistical summaries and graphics functions for the analysing tidy time series data. The package name ‘feasts’ is an acronym comprising of its key features: Feature Extraction And Statistics for Time Series.

***Sparse Reluctant Interaction Modeling*** (**sprintr**)An implementation of a computationally efficient method to fit large-scale interaction models based on the reluctant interaction selection principle. The method and its properties are described in greater depth in Yu, G., Bien, J., and Tibshirani, R.J. (2019) ‘Reluctant interaction modeling’, which is available at <arXiv:1907.08414>.

***Block Splitting Algorithm for Estimation with Fused Penalty Functions*** (**fusedest**)Provides methods fusedest_normal() and fusedest_logit() for carrying out block splitting algorithms for fused penalty estimation.

***Contrast Analyses for Factorial Designs*** (**cofad**)Contrast analysis for factorial designs is an alternative to the classical ANOVA approach with the advantage of testing focused hypothesis. The method is mainly based on Rosenthal, Rosnow and Rubin (2000, ISBN:978-0521659802) and Sedlmeier and Renkewitz (2018, ISBN:978-3868943214).
