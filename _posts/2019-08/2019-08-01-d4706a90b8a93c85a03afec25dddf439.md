Prologue I have been working on ‘pdqr’ package for quite some time now. Initially it was intended only for creating custom distribution functions (analogues of base “p”, “d”, “q”, and “r” functions) from numeric sample. However, after couple of breakthrough ideas, it also became a set of tools for transforming and summarizing distributions.Now I would like to make it public with hope to get any feedback about the package: its general design, function and argument names, numerical issues, etc.
