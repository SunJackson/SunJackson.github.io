In particular we will discuss the `Python` implementation (also called `data_algebra`) and its relation to the mature `R` implementations (`rquery` and `rqdatatable`).




Introduction
Parts of the project are in early development (and not yet ready for production use), and other parts are mature and have been used in production.

The project intent is to realize a modern data processing language based on Codd’s relational operators that is easy to maintain, has helpful tooling, and has very similar realizations (or dialects) for:

- `SQL` databases accessed from `Python` (in development here, not yet ready for production use).

- `Pandas` `Data.Frame` objects in `Python` (in development here, not yet ready for production use).

- `SQL` databases access from `R` (implementation is here, and is mature and ready for production use).

- `data.table` objects in `R` (implementation is here, and is mature and ready for production use).


The idea is the notation should look idiomatic in each language. Working in `Python` should feel like working in `Python`, and working in `R` should feel like working in `R`. The data semantics, however, are designed to be close to the `SQL` realizations (given the close connection of `SQL` to the relational algebra; in particular row numbering starts at `1` and row and column order is not preserved except at row-order steps or select-columns steps respectively). The intent is: it should be very easy to use the system in either `Python` or `R` (a boon to multi-language data science projects) and it is easy to port either code or experience from one system to another (a boon for porting projects, or for data scientists working with more than one code base or computer language).

Related work includes:

The `data_algebra` principles include:

- Writing data transforms as a pipeline or method-chain of many simple transform steps.

- Treating data transform pipelines or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as themselves being sharable data.

- Being able to use the same transform specification many places (in memory, on databases, in `R`, in `Python`).


## Example

Let’s start with an example in `Python`.

For our example we will assume we have a data set of how many points different subjects score in a psychological survey. The goal is transform the data so that we see what fraction of the subjects answers are in each category (subject to an exponential transform, as often used in logistic regression). We then treat the per-subject renormalized data as a probabilty or diagnosis.

The exact meaning of such a scoring method are not the topic of this note. It is a notional example to show a non-trivial data transformation need. In particular: having to normalize per-subject (divide some set of scores per-subject by a per-subject total) is a classic pain point in data-processing. In classic `SQL` this can only be done by joining against a summary table, or in more modern `SQL` with a “window function.” We want to show by working in small enough steps this can be done simply.

### Set up

Let’s start our `Python` example. First we import the packages we are going to use, and set a few options.

In [1]:





Now let’s type in our example data. Notice this is an in-memory `Pandas` `Data.Frame`.

In [2]:

Out[2]:

||subjectID|surveyCategory|assessmentTotal|irrelevantCol1|irrelevantCol2
|------
|0|1|withdrawal behavior|5|irrel1|irrel2|
|1|1|positive re-framing|2|irrel1|irrel2|
|2|2|withdrawal behavior|3|irrel1|irrel2|
|3|2|positive re-framing|4|irrel1|irrel2|




In [3]:

In [4]:

Out[4]:

||subjectid|surveycategory|assessmenttotal|irrelevantcol1|irrelevantcol2
|------
|0|1.0|withdrawal behavior|5.0|irrel1|irrel2|
|1|1.0|positive re-framing|2.0|irrel1|irrel2|
|2|2.0|withdrawal behavior|3.0|irrel1|irrel2|
|3|2.0|positive re-framing|4.0|irrel1|irrel2|





Normally one does not read data back from a database, but instead materializes results in the database with `SQL` commands such as `CREATE TABLE tablename AS SELECT ...`.Also note: case in columns is a bit of nightmare. It is often best to lower-case them all.

### Back to the `data_algebra`

Now we continue our example by importing the `data_algebra` components we need.

In [5]:

In [7]:



TableDescription(
 table_name="d",
 column_names=[
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 "assessmentTotal",
 "irrelevantCol1",
 "irrelevantCol2",
 ],
).extend({"probability": "(assessmentTotal * 0.237).exp()"}).extend(
 {"total": "probability.sum()"}, partition_by=["subjectID"]
 {"probability": "probability / total"}
).extend(
 {"row_number": "_row_number()"},
 partition_by=["subjectID"],
 order_by=["probability", "surveyCategory"],
 reverse=["probability"],
).select_rows(
 "row_number == 1"
).select_columns(
 ["subjectID", "surveyCategory", "probability"]
).rename_columns(
 {"diagnosis": "surveyCategory"}
).order_rows(
 ["subjectID"]
)












In either case, the pipeline is read as a sequence of operations (top to bottom, and left to right). What it is saying is:

- We start with a table named “d” that is known to have columns “subjectID”, “surveyCategory”, “assessmentTotal”, “irrelevantCol1”, and “irrelevantCol2”.

We produce a new table by transforming this table through a sequence of “extend” operations which add new columns.

- The first `extend` computes `probability = exp(scale*assessmentTotal)`, this is similar to the inverse-link step of a logistic regression. We assume when writing this pipleline we were given this math as a requirement.

- The next few `extend` steps total the `probabilty` per-subject (this is controlled by the `partition_by` argument) and then rank the normalized probabilities per-subject (grouping again specified by the `partition_by` argument, and order contolled by the `order_by` clause).


The point is: each step is deliberately so trivial one can reason about it. However the many steps in sequence do quite a lot.

### `SQL`

Once we have the `ops` object we can do quite a lot with it. We have already exhibited the pretty-printing of the pipeline. Next we demonstrate translating the operator pipeline into `SQL`.

In [8]:



SELECT "probability",
 "subjectid",
 "diagnosis"
FROM
 (SELECT "probability",
 "subjectid",
 "surveycategory" AS "diagnosis"
 FROM
 (SELECT "probability",
 "surveycategory",
 "subjectid"
 FROM
 (SELECT "probability",
 "surveycategory",
 "subjectid"
 FROM
 (SELECT "probability",
 "surveycategory",
 "subjectid",
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "subjectid"
 ORDER BY "probability" DESC, "surveycategory") AS "row_number"
 FROM
 (SELECT "surveycategory",
 "subjectid",
 "probability" / "total" AS "probability"
 FROM
 (SELECT "probability",
 "surveycategory",
 "subjectid",
 SUM("probability") OVER (PARTITION BY "subjectid") AS "total"
 FROM
 (SELECT "surveycategory",
 "subjectid",
 EXP(("assessmenttotal" * 0.237)) AS "probability"
 FROM
 (SELECT "assessmenttotal",
 "surveycategory",
 "subjectid"
 FROM "d") "sq_0") "sq_1") "sq_2") "sq_3") "sq_4"
 WHERE "row_number" = 1 ) "sq_5") "sq_6") "sq_7"
ORDER BY "subjectid"











The `SQL` can be hard to read, as `SQL` expresses composition by inner-nesting (inside `SELECT` statements happen first). The operator pipeline expresses composition by sequencing or method-chaining, which can be a lot more legible. However the huge advantage of the `SQL` is: we can send it to the database for execution, as we do now.

Also notice the generate `SQL` has applied query narrowing: columns not used in the outer queries are removed from the inner queries. The “irrelevant” columns are not carried into the calculation as they would be with a `SELECT *`. This early optimization comes in quite handy.

In [9]:

Out[9]:

||probability|subjectid|diagnosis
|------
|0|0.670622|1.0|withdrawal behavior|
|1|0.558974|2.0|positive re-framing|





What comes back is: one row per subject, with the highest per-subject diagnosis and the estimated probabilty. Again, the math of this is outside the scope of this note (think of that as something coming from a specification)- the ability to write such a pipeline is our actual topic.

The hope is that the `data_algebra` pipeline is easier to read, write, and maintain than the `SQL` query. If we wanted to change the calculation we would just add a stage to the `data_algebra` pipeline and then regenerate the `SQL` query.

### `Pandas`

An advantage of the pipeline is it can also be directly used on `Pandas` `DataFrame`s. Let’s see how that is achieved.

In [10]:

Out[10]:

||subjectID|diagnosis|probability
|------
|0|1|withdrawal behavior|0.670622|
|1|2|positive re-framing|0.558974|





`eval_pandas` takes a dictionary of `Pandas` `DataFrame`s (names matching names specified in the pipeline) and returns the result of applying the pipeline to the data using `Pandas` commands. Currently our `Pandas` implementation only allows very simple window functions. This is why did’t write `probability = probability/sum(probability)`, but instead broken the calculation into multiple steps by introducing the `total` column (the `SQL` realizaition does in fact support more complex window functions). This is a small issue with the grammar: but our feeling encourange simple steps is in fact a good thing (improves debugabbility), and in `SQL` the query optimizers likely optimize the different query styles into very similar realizations anyway.

## Export/Import




However, `data_algebra` also supports exporting a pipeline to and from simple structures that are in turn optimized for conversion to `YAML`. The simple structure format is particularly useful for writing more `data_algebra` tools (such as pipeline analysis and presentation tools). And the `YAML` tooling makes moving a processing pipeline to another a language (such as `R`) quite easy.

We will demonstrate this next.

In [11]:



[OrderedDict([('op', 'TableDescription'),
 ('table_name', 'd'),
 ('qualifiers', {}),
 ('column_names',
 ['subjectID',
 'surveyCategory',
 'assessmentTotal',
 'irrelevantCol1',
 'irrelevantCol2']),
 ('key', 'd')]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'Extend'),
 ('ops', {'probability': 'exp(assessmentTotal * 0.237)'}),
 ('partition_by', []),
 ('order_by', []),
 ('reverse', [])]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'Extend'),
 ('ops', {'total': 'sum(probability)'}),
 ('partition_by', ['subjectID']),
 ('order_by', []),
 ('reverse', [])]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'Extend'),
 ('ops', {'probability': 'probability / total'}),
 ('partition_by', []),
 ('order_by', []),
 ('reverse', [])]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'Extend'),
 ('ops', {'row_number': 'row_number()'}),
 ('partition_by', ['subjectID']),
 ('order_by', ['probability', 'surveyCategory']),
 ('reverse', ['probability'])]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'SelectRows'), ('expr', 'row_number == 1')]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'SelectColumns'),
 ('columns', ['subjectID', 'surveyCategory', 'probability'])]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'Rename'),
 ('column_remapping', {'diagnosis': 'surveyCategory'})]),
 OrderedDict([('op', 'Order'),
 ('order_columns', ['subjectID']),
 ('reverse', []),
 ('limit', None)])]











In the above data structure the recursive operator steps have been linearized into a list, and simplified to just ordered dictionaries of a few defining and derived fields. In particular, the `key` field of the `TableDescription` nodes is the unique identifier for the tables, two `TableDescription` with the same key are referring to the same table.

We can then write this representation to `YAML` format.

### `R`

 This pipeline can be loaded into `R` and used as follows.

In [13]:

In [14]:



table(d; 
 subjectID,
 surveyCategory,
 assessmentTotal,
 irrelevantCol1,
 irrelevantCol2) %.>%
 probability := exp(assessmentTotal * 0.237)) %.>%
 extend(.,
 total := sum(probability),
 p= subjectID) %.>%
 probability := probability / total) %.>%
 extend(.,
 row_number := row_number(),
 p= subjectID,
 o= "probability" DESC, "surveyCategory") %.>%
 select_rows(.,
 row_number == 1) %.>%
 select_columns(.,
 subjectID, surveyCategory, probability) %.>%
 rename(.,
 c('diagnosis' = 'surveyCategory')) %.>%
 orderby(., subjectID)










In [15]:



 subjectID surveyCategory assessmentTotal irrelevantCol1 irrelevantCol2
1 1 withdrawal behavior 5 irrel1 irrel2
2 1 positive re-framing 2 irrel1 irrel2
3 2 withdrawal behavior 3 irrel1 irrel2
4 2 positive re-framing 4 irrel1 irrel2











We can use the `R` pipeline by piping data into the `r_ops` object.

In [16]:



 subjectID diagnosis probability
1: 1 withdrawal behavior 0.6706221
2: 2 positive re-framing 0.5589742











And the `R` `rquery` package can also perform its own `SQL` translation (and even execution management).

In [17]:



SELECT * FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID" AS "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory" AS "diagnosis",
 "probability" AS "probability"
 FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 "probability"
 FROM (
 SELECT * FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 "probability",
 row_number ( ) OVER ( PARTITION BY "subjectID" ORDER BY "probability" DESC, "surveyCategory" ) AS "row_number"
 FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 "probability" / "total" AS "probability"
 FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 "probability",
 sum ( "probability" ) OVER ( PARTITION BY "subjectID" ) AS "total"
 FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 exp ( "assessmentTotal" * 0.237 ) AS "probability"
 FROM (
 SELECT
 "subjectID",
 "surveyCategory",
 "assessmentTotal"
 FROM
 "d"
 ) tsql_76525498125437036191_0000000000

 ) tsql_76525498125437036191_0000000003
 ) tsql_76525498125437036191_0000000004
 WHERE "row_number" = 1
 ) tsql_76525498125437036191_0000000005
 ) tsql_76525498125437036191_0000000006
) tsql_76525498125437036191_0000000007 ORDER BY "subjectID"










The `R` implementation supports additional features such as converting a pipeline into a diagram (though that would also be easy to implement in `Python` on top of the `collect_representation()` objects).




## Advantages of `data_algebra`

Multi-language data science is an important trend, so a cross-language query system that supports at least `R` and `Python` is going to be a useful tool or capability going forward. Obviously `SQL` itself is fairly cross-language, but `data_algebra` adds a few features we hope are real advantages.

In addition to the features shown above, a `data_algebra` operator pipeline carries around usable knowledge of the data transform. For example:

## Conclusion

 The `data_algebra` is part of a powerful cross-language and mutli-implementaiton family data manipulation tools. These tools can greatly reduce the development and maintenance cost of data science projects, while improving the documentation of project intent.

Win Vector LLC is looking for sponsors and partners to further the package. In particular if your group is using both `R` and `Python` in big-data projects (where `SQL` is a need, including `Apache Spark`), or are porting a project from one of these languages to another- please get in touch.




## Appendix:

 Demonstrate we can round-trip a `data_algebra` through `YAML` and recover the code.
