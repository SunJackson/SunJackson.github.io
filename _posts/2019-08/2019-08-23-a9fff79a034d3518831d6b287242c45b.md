The past few months I’ve been wondering how I could continue to maintain the Data Blogger website and how Data Blogger fits into my personal and professional goals.



Data Blogger is mainly a Python-focussed Data engineering blog. In the mean time I finished my research master and I am interested in doing AI, Machine Learning, NLP and IR research. There is some overlap; for doing research, some engineer skills are helpful and therefore I decided to continue Data Blogger. The blog posts which are mainly about engineering will be published on Data Blogger. For research blog posts I created a new blog: blog.kevin-jacobs.com. I will not accept any advertisements or commercially-based guest posts on the new research blog.

If you have any questions, send me a DM on Twitter or leave a comment below.
