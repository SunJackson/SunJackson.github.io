 A month ago we closed Call for Papers for Why R? 2019 Conference. Today we are pleased to announce the agenda!

From over 75 submissions (from 4 continents) we finally selected 46 presentations (divided into 12 sessions), 15 lightning talks and 9 workshops!! Abstracts are already available here.

To make the event even more interesting we invited 6 keynotes that will for sure give amazing plenary talks. Learn more about keynotes and proposed workshops in this post

Why R? 2019 Conference – Keynotes and Workshops announced

We are more than happy to announce that Why R? 2019 Conference will be organized by Why R? Foundation. The third official meeting of Polish R enthusiasts will be held in Warsaw 26-29 September 2019. As the meeting is held in English, we are happy to invite R users from other countries.

The purpose of the conference is to provide the space for the professional networking and knowledge exchange, between practitioners and students, from the area of statistical machine learning, programming, optimization and data science fields.

## The form

The event consists of

- 1 day of hackathon (60-70 attendees),

- 1 day of workshops (150 attendees),

- 1 evening of round tables (80 attendees),

- 2 days of lectures (250 attendees)

- and one evening planned for the Welcome paRty/Reception (100 attendees).


In 2019 we are expecting in total 350 unique attendees that will join our conference that is planned for 4 days – 26-29.09.2019.

## Participants

The Why R? events are aimed at experienced data science practitioners although each conference gathers a significant percentage of students (~30%). Our participants recruit from very diverse backgrounds with a clear domination of mathematics (especially statistics) and computer science. All of them have occupations related to data science, including professional R developers (programmers), data engineers, machine learning practitioners and business analysts. One of the key advantages of Why R? is its ability to attract participants both from academia and industry.
