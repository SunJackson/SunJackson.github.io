- The easiest way to be a 10x engineer is to make 10 other engineers 2x more efficient. Someone can be a 10x engineer if they do nothing for 364 days then convinces the team to change programming language to a 2x more productive language.

- A motivated 10x engineer in one team could be a demotivated 0.5x engineer in another team (and vice versa).

- A average 1x engineer could easily become a 5x engineer if surrounded by 10x engineers. Engagement and work ethics is contagious.

- The cynical reason why 10x engineers aren’t paid 10x more salary is that there is no way for the new employer to know. There is no “10x badge”.

- …but also, a 10x engineer can go to a new company and become an 1x engineer because of bad focus / bad engagement / tech stack mismatch.

- So unfortunately there’s less economic rationality for companies to pay 10x salaries to 10x engineers (contrary to what [Google](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-policy-to-pay-unfairly-2015-4) or [Netflix](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/98-Takes_Great_Judgment_Goal_is) says)

- There’s no such thing as a 10x engineer spending time on something that never ends up delivering business value. If something doesn’t deliver business value, it’s 0x.

- If you build something that the average engineer *would not have been able to build, no matter how much time*, that can make you 100x or 1000x, or ∞x. [Quoting Alexander Scott](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/27/things-that-are-not-superintelligences): *There is no number of ordinary eight-year-olds who, when organized into a team, will become smart enough to beat a grandmaster in chess[.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/27/things-that-are-not-superintelligences)*

- Most of the 10x factor is most likely explained by team and company factors (process, tech stack, etc) and applies to everyone in the team/company. Intra-team variation is thus much smaller than 10x (even controlling for the fact that companies tend to attract people of equal caliber). Nature vs nurture…

- I’ve never met the legendary “10x jerk”. Anecdotally the outperforming engineers are generally nice and humble.

- Don’t get hung up on the exact numbers here, it’s just for illustration purposes. I.e. someone introduced a [bug in the trading system](http://pythonsweetness.tumblr.com/post/64740079543/how-to-lose-172222-a-second-for-45-minutes) of Knight Capital that made them lose $465M in 30 minutes. Did that make it a -1,000,000x engineer? (and btw it had more to do with company culture). The numbers aren’t meant to be taken literally.

*I got a unique photo opportunity of this small group of 10x engineers until they suddenly vanished. All I managed to hear was “Merkle trees” and “Kappa architecture”. What are the meanings of those expressions? We will never know.*
