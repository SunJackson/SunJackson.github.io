In this tutorial, I will show you how you can convert your WordPress website to a static website and how you can host it on AWS S3.



## Step 1: Generate static files using Scrapy

I created a GitHub repository which helps you to convert your local running website to static resource files. The GitHub repository is found [here](https://github.com/kevin91nl/website-scrape-and-deploy). The README file explains how you can create the configuration and how you can run Scrapy and all the other steps described in this article.

## Step 2: Upload to AWS S3

Make sure that you have an AWS S3 bucket which is configured for hosting websites. Then, upload all your static resources to this folder.

 

## Step 3: Invalidate caches (optional)

If you have Amazon CloudFront for distributing your website, make sure to invalidate all the caches.

## Conclusion (TL;DR)

It is fairly easy to setup a pipeline which converts your local WordPress website to a static website.
