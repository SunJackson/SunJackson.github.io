If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing *jet*. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an [appropriately ranty blogpost](https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps) on the subject:

Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's `matplotlib` package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper [Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful](http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf) and, for more general visualization tips, [Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833).

So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.
