Why are volcanoes shaped the way they are? Why do they all look conical?*

*I've been reliably informed that not all volcanoes are conical. In fact it is only cinder cone volcanoes that have this shape. Shield, Dome and Composite volcanoes have different shapes to reflect the different processes of how they are formed.

It's a similar shape to piles of sand, piles of grain, and sand dunes. If you pour salt onto a table, or look at at hour glass running out, you see the same shape. What's going on?

It's a combination of gravity and friction. The grains of sand, rock or ash are pulled down by gravity; they want to flow down-hill. They are, however, also gripped by the other particles already on the slope. This gripping is called friction. Sharp, rough or sticky substances have more friction and this grip force is strong. Smooth or slippery substances are gripped less.

The friction force is proportional to the normal reaction (the force perpendicular to the direction the object is trying to move), and the limiting ratio of this force to the normal is a dimensionless constant called the *coefficient of friction*. This is typically given the symbol μ
