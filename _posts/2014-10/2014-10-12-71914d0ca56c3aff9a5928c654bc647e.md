### 
Creating a Data-Driven Organization: the book


This is a great opportunity to go deep into what it means to be data-driven and to think about how organizations best achive that goal. I'll cover the infrastructure, skills, and culture needed to create organizations that take their data, treat it as a core asset, and use it to drive and inform critical business decisions and ultimately make an impact.

So far, it has been a lot of fun. I've read and learned a ton and can't wait to share.

No word yet on which animal will appear on the cover...
