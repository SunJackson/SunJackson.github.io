"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is being driven by a staggering
range of new technologies that are blurring the boundaries between
people, the internet and the physical world. It's a convergence of
the digital, physical and biological spheres." --Fulvia Montresor,
Director of the World Economic Forum, 2016


Did you notice whenever an L train (part of Chicago's public transit
system) rumbles by our office, a little train rumbles by in the footer
of our web page? Well, now you know: it's almost like you're in our
office.

Why would we do such a thing? Mostly for fun, and we've got a soft
spot for the train because every one of our four offices so far has
been adjacent to a purple line train. But
also, it's an example of one of the important changes happening that
gets us excited about the future of technology and data science in
particular: the blurring boundary between the digital and physical
worlds.

The initial rise of data science was mostly driven by "digital
footprints" -- basically, data created by people using digital
things. Along the way, a lot of useful applications grew not just from
log files and databases but "unstructured data" -- basically, data
created by people writing things in natural language. Now, we're
seeing another slew of projects not only from "digital footprints" and
"unstructured data" but "sensor traces", basically -- data created by
physical things such as cars, homes, and even ourselves.

We're excited about this blurring boundary because it opens up a
universe of the most exciting type of data science opportunities: the
type where there is an important problem, previously only approached
with qualitative reasoning, that can suddenly be approached
scientifically (quantitatively). But these opportunities with the IoT
are deceptively ambiguous: the ability to execute often lags our
imagination.

The general IoT strategy that we've seen so far in the wild is
something like this:

It's an unfortunate reality that organizations spend too much time and
money planning and developing IoT infrastructure only to realize
retrospectively the opportunity they were pursuing wasn't well
formulated.

So, what's a better way? Approach the problem like an entrepreneur or
a designer. With ambiguous opportunities (like those that come along
with the IoT),
planning and infrastructure development are less important. Why
invest in a plan that will be obsolete? Make iteration cycles fast and
less expensive by starting with quick, low-fidelity prototypes while
the opportunities are still ambiguous. Only transition to
higher-fidelity prototypes and production infrastructure as you start
to see where the real value lies. In our experience, it's the only way
to avoid costly IoT mistakes.
