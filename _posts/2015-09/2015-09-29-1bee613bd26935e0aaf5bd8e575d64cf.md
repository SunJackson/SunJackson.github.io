Our `theano.function` call looks a bit different than in our first example. Yeah, we have this additional `updates` parameter. `updates` allows us to update our shared variables according to an expression. `updates` expects a list of 2-tuples:

The second part of each tuple can be an expression or function that returns the new value we want to update the first part to. In our case, we have two shared variables we want to update, `theta1` and `theta2` and we want to use our `grad_desc` function to give us the updated data. Of course our `grad_desc` function expects two arguments, a cost function and a weight matrix, so we pass those in. `fc` is our cost expression. So every time we invoke/call the `cost` function that we've compiled with Theano, it will also update our shared variables according to our `grad_desc` rule. Pretty convenient!

Additionally, we've compiled a `run_forward` function just so we can run the network forward and make sure it has trained properly. We don't need to update anything there.

Now let's define our training data and setup a `for` loop to iterate through our training epochs.
