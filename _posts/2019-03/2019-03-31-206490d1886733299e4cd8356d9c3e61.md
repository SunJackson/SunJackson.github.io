In our last post mapedit and leaflet.js >1.0 wediscussed remaining tasks for theRConsortium funded project`mapedit`. `mapedit 0.5.0` fixesa couple of lingering issues, but primarily focuses on bringing thepower of `Leaflet.pm` as analternate editor.`Leaflet.draw`,the original editor in `mapedit` provided by `leaflet.extras`, is awonderful tool but struggles with snapping and those pesky holes that wecommonly face in geospatial tasks. Depending on the task, a user mightprefer to continue using `Leaflet.draw`, so we will maintain fullsupport for both editors. We’ll spend the rest of the post demonstratingwhere `Leaflet.pm` excels to help illustrate when you might want tochoose `editor = "leafpm"`.

## Install/Update

At a minimum, to follow along with the rest of this post, please update`mapedit` and install the new standalone package `leafpm`. While we areit, we highly recommend updating your other geospatial dependencies.

```
install.packages(c("sf", "leaflet", "leafpm", "mapview", "mapedit"))
# lwgeom is optional but nice when working with holes in leaflet.pm
# install.packages("lwgeom")

```

## Holes

`mapedit` now supports holes. Let’s look at a quick example in which weadd, edit, and delete holes.

```
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)
library(mapedit)
library(leafpm)
# make a contrived polygon with holes for testing
outer1 = matrix(c(0,0,10,0,10,10,0,10,0,0),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
hole1 = matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,1,1),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
hole2 = matrix(c(5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
outer2 = matrix(c(11,0,11,1,12,1,12,0,11,0),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
pts1 = list(outer1, hole1, hole2)
pts2 = list(outer2)
pl1 = st_sf(geom = st_sfc(st_polygon(pts1)))
pl2 = st_sf(geom = st_sfc(st_polygon(pts2)))
mpl = st_sf(geom = st_combine(rbind(pl1, pl2)), crs=4326)
tst = editFeatures(mpl, editor = "leafpm")
# look at our creation
mapview(tst)

```

Please note that right mouse click deletes vertexes. For a more realworld application `franconia[5,]` from `mapview` has a hole. Try to editit with the following code.

```
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)
library(mapedit)
library(leafpm)
editFeatures(franconia[5,], editor="leafpm")

```

## Snapping

`Leaflet.pm` gives us a very pleasant snapping experience, so if youwant to snap, set `editor = "leafpm"` and snap away. Snapping isparticular important when drawing/digitizing features from scratch. Hereis how it looks with the example from above.

Snapping is enabled by default.

## Fixes For Lingering Issues

### GeoJSON Precision

> 
Robin Lovelace discovered that atleaflet zoom level > 17 we lose coordinate precision. Of course,this is not good enough, so we will prioritize a fix as discussed inissue. Hopefully,this leaflet.js pullrequest will make thisfix fairly straightforward.


I am happy to report that we have found a solution for the loss ofprecision. Please let us know if you discover any remaining problems.

## Mulitlinestring Editing

> 
Leaflet.js and multilinestrings don’t get along as TimAppelhans reported inissue.For complete support of `sf`, `mapedit` should work withmultilinestring, so we have promoted this to issue62.


We backed into a solution with `MULTILINESTRING` since `Leaflet.pm`’sapproach fits better with `MULTI*` features. As an example, let’s editone of the `trails` from `mapview`.

```
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)
library(mapedit)
library(leafpm)
editFeatures(trails[4,], editor="leafpm")

```

## Conclusion and Thanks

As of this post we have reached the end of the extremely generousRConsortium funding of `mapedit`.Although the funding is over, we still expect to actively maintain andimprove `mapedit`. One feature that we had hoped to implement as part ofthe `mapedit` toolset was editing of feature attributes. This turned outto be very ambitious, and unfortunately we were not able to implement asatisfactory solution for this feature during the funding period. Weplan, however, to develop a solution. Your participation, ideas, andfeedback are as vital as ever, so please continue to engage. Thanks toall those who have contributed so far and thanks to all open sourcecontributors in the R and JavaScript communities.
