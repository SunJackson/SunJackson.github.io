Hey all, just a quick post to give you some details about my workshop at useR! 2019, in Toulouse!



## Hacking RStudio: Advanced Use of your Favorite IDE

### About

Have you ever wanted to become more productive with RStudio? Then this workshop is made for you!

Youâ€™ve been wandering the web for a while now, reading about all the things the cool kids do with RStudio:

- building addins & playing around with the `{rstudioapi}` package, like for example what we do in `{remedy}`,

- using project templates, like the one in `{golem}`,

- managing connections, like the (just for fun) package I wrote called `{fryingpane}`â€¦


All this seems pretty nifty but so far you have never find the time to sit down and learn how to master these skills. Then, youâ€™ve come to the right place â€” my useR workshop will teach you how to push the boundaries of your basic RStudio usage, in order to become more efficient in your day to day usage of RStudio.

### Target audience

We expect people to be familiar with RStudio, and have a little knowledge about programming with R. Knowing how to build a package will be better, but is not mandatory.

### Instruction

Please come with a recent version of RStudio installed.

## Sign up for useR

useR! 2019 will be hold from the 9th to the 12th of July, in Toulouse.

Early birds close soon (May 7th), so hurry ðŸ˜‰
