Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword in the industry for the past few years. However, the field of AI actually dates back to 1943, when Alan Turing posed his famous “Turing Test” to see the limits of computational cognition.

Techjury recently released an infographic detailing the history of AI from 1943 up to 2014, during which the Turing Test came full circle as the chatbot Eugene Goostman became the first ever machine to pass the test.

What could be in store for the future?
