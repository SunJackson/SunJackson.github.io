**From Language to Goals: Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Instruction Following**

Reinforcement learning is a promising framework for solving control problems, but its use in practical situations is hampered by the fact that reward functions are often difficult to engineer. Specifying goals and tasks for autonomous machines, such as robots, is a significant challenge: conventionally, reward functions and goal states have been used to communicate objectives. But people can communicate objectives to each other simply by describing or demonstrating them. How can we build learning algorithms that will allow us to tell machines what we want them to do? In this work, we investigate the problem of grounding language commands as reward functions using inverse reinforcement learning, and argue that language-conditioned rewards are more transferable than language-conditioned policies to new environments. We propose language-conditioned reward learning (LC-RL), which grounds language commands as a reward function represented by a deep neural network. We demonstrate that our model learns rewards that transfer to novel tasks and environments on realistic, high-dimensional visual environments with natural language commands, whereas directly learning a language-conditioned policy leads to poor performance.

**Formalizing Cyber–Physical System Model Transformation via Abstract Interpretation**

Model transformation tools assist system designers by reducing the labor–intensive task of creating and updating models of various aspects of systems, ensuring that modeling assumptions remain consistent across every model of a system, and identifying constraints on system design imposed by these modeling assumptions. We have proposed a model transformation approach based on abstract interpretation, a static program analysis technique. Abstract interpretation allows us to define transformations that are provably correct and specific. This work develops the foundations of this approach to model transformation. We define model transformation in terms of abstract interpretation and prove the soundness of our approach. Furthermore, we develop formalisms useful for encoding model properties. This work provides a methodology for relating models of different aspects of a system and for applying modeling techniques from one system domain, such as smart power grids, to other domains, such as water distribution networks.

**Cross Validation for Penalized Quantile Regression with a Case-Weight Adjusted Solution Path**

Cross validation is widely used for selecting tuning parameters in regularization methods, but it is computationally intensive in general. To lessen its computational burden, approximation schemes such as generalized approximate cross validation (GACV) are often employed. However, such approximations may not work well when non-smooth loss functions are involved. As a case in point, approximate cross validation schemes for penalized quantile regression do not work well for extreme quantiles. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to compute the leave-one-out cross validation scores exactly for quantile regression with ridge penalty through a case-weight adjusted solution path. Resorting to the homotopy technique in optimization, we introduce a case weight for each individual data point as a continuous embedding parameter and decrease the weight gradually from one to zero to link the estimators based on the full data and those with a case deleted. This allows us to design a solution path algorithm to compute all leave-one-out estimators very efficiently from the full-data solution. We show that the case-weight adjusted solution path is piecewise linear in the weight parameter, and using the solution path, we examine case influences comprehensively and observe that different modes of case influences emerge, depending on the specified quantiles, data dimensions and penalty parameter.

**Integer-Valued Functional Data Analysis for Measles Forecasting**

Measles presents a unique and imminent challenge for epidemiologists and public health officials: the disease is highly contagious, yet vaccination rates are declining precipitously in many localities. Consequently, the risk of a measles outbreak continues to rise. To improve preparedness, we study historical measles data both pre- and post-vaccine, and design new methodology to forecast measles counts with uncertainty quantification. We propose to model the disease counts as an integer-valued functional time series: measles counts are a function of time-of-year and time-ordered by year. The counts are modeled using a negative-binomial distribution conditional on a real-valued latent process, which accounts for the overdispersion observed in the data. The latent process is decomposed using an unknown basis expansion, which is learned from the data, with dynamic basis coefficients. The resulting framework provides enhanced capability to model complex seasonality, which varies dynamically from year-to-year, and offers improved multi-month ahead point forecasts and substantially tighter forecast intervals (with correct coverage) compared to existing forecasting models. Importantly, the fully Bayesian approach provides well-calibrated and precise uncertainty quantification for epi-relevent features, such as the future value and time of the peak measles count in a given year. An R package is available online.

**AdaLinUCB: Opportunistic Learning for Contextual Bandits**

In this paper, we propose and study opportunistic contextual bandits – a special case of contextual bandits where the exploration cost varies under different environmental conditions, such as network load or return variation in recommendations. When the exploration cost is low, so is the actual regret of pulling a sub-optimal arm (e.g., trying a suboptimal recommendation). Therefore, intuitively, we could explore more when the exploration cost is relatively low and exploit more when the exploration cost is relatively high. Inspired by this intuition, for opportunistic contextual bandits with Linear payoffs, we propose an Adaptive Upper-Confidence-Bound algorithm (AdaLinUCB) to adaptively balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for opportunistic learning. We prove that AdaLinUCB achieves O((log T)^2) problem-dependent regret upper bound, which has a smaller coefficient than that of the traditional LinUCB algorithm. Moreover, based on both synthetic and real-world dataset, we show that AdaLinUCB significantly outperforms other contextual bandit algorithms, under large exploration cost fluctuations.

**Learning Dual Retrieval Module for Semi-supervised Relation Extraction**

**Stable and Fair Classification**

Fair classification has been a topic of intense study in machine learning, and several algorithms have been proposed towards this important task. However, in a recent study, Friedler et al. observed that fair classification algorithms may not be stable with respect to variations in the training dataset — a crucial consideration in several real-world applications. Motivated by their work, we study the problem of designing classification algorithms that are both fair and stable. We propose an extended framework based on fair classification algorithms that are formulated as optimization problems, by introducing a stability-focused regularization term. Theoretically, we prove a stability guarantee, that was lacking in fair classification algorithms, and also provide an accuracy guarantee for our extended framework. Our accuracy guarantee can be used to inform the selection of the regularization parameter in our framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines stability and fairness in automated decision-making tasks. We assess the benefits of our approach empirically by extending several fair classification algorithms that are shown to achieve the best balance between fairness and accuracy over the Adult dataset. Our empirical results show that our framework indeed improves the stability at only a slight sacrifice in accuracy.

**Predicting ConceptNet Path Quality Using Crowdsourced Assessments of Naturalness**

In many applications, it is important to characterize the way in which two concepts are semantically related. Knowledge graphs such as ConceptNet provide a rich source of information for such characterizations by encoding relations between concepts as edges in a graph. When two concepts are not directly connected by an edge, their relationship can still be described in terms of the paths that connect them. Unfortunately, many of these paths are uninformative and noisy, which means that the success of applications that use such path features crucially relies on their ability to select high-quality paths. In existing applications, this path selection process is based on relatively simple heuristics. In this paper we instead propose to learn to predict path quality from crowdsourced human assessments. Since we are interested in a generic task-independent notion of quality, we simply ask human participants to rank paths according to their subjective assessment of the paths’ naturalness, without attempting to define naturalness or steering the participants towards particular indicators of quality. We show that a neural network model trained on these assessments is able to predict human judgments on unseen paths with near optimal performance. Most notably, we find that the resulting path selection method is substantially better than the current heuristic approaches at identifying meaningful paths.

**STFNets: Learning Sensing Signals from the Time-Frequency Perspective with Short-Time Fourier Neural Networks**

Recent advances in deep learning motivate the use of deep neural networks in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. These networks are modelled after signal processing in the human brain, thereby leading to significant advantages at perceptual tasks such as vision and speech recognition. IoT applications, however, often measure physical phenomena, where the underlying physics (such as inertia, wireless signal propagation, or the natural frequency of oscillation) are fundamentally a function of signal frequencies, offering better features in the frequency domain. This observation leads to a fundamental question: For IoT applications, can one develop a new brand of neural network structures that synthesize features inspired not only by the biology of human perception but also by the fundamental nature of physics? Hence, in this paper, instead of using conventional building blocks (e.g., convolutional and recurrent layers), we propose a new foundational neural network building block, the Short-Time Fourier Neural Network (STFNet). It integrates a widely-used time-frequency analysis method, the Short-Time Fourier Transform, into data processing to learn features directly in the frequency domain, where the physics of underlying phenomena leave better foot-prints. STFNets bring additional flexibility to time-frequency analysis by offering novel nonlinear learnable operations that are spectral-compatible. Moreover, STFNets show that transforming signals to a domain that is more connected to the underlying physics greatly simplifies the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STFNets with extensive experiments. STFNets significantly outperform the state-of-the-art deep learning models in all experiments. A STFNet, therefore, demonstrates superior capability as the fundamental building block of deep neural networks for IoT applications for various sensor inputs.

**Probabilistic Neural-symbolic Models for Interpretable Visual Question Answering**

We propose a new class of probabilistic neural-symbolic models, that have symbolic functional programs as a latent, stochastic variable. Instantiated in the context of visual question answering, our probabilistic formulation offers two key conceptual advantages over prior neural-symbolic models for VQA. Firstly, the programs generated by our model are more understandable while requiring lesser number of teaching examples. Secondly, we show that one can pose counterfactual scenarios to the model, to probe its beliefs on the programs that could lead to a specified answer given an image. Our results on the CLEVR and SHAPES datasets verify our hypotheses, showing that the model gets better program (and answer) prediction accuracy even in the low data regime, and allows one to probe the coherence and consistency of reasoning performed.

**Deep Adaptive Input Normalization for Price Forecasting using Limit Order Book Data**

Deep Learning (DL) models can be used to tackle time series analysis tasks with great success. However, the performance of DL models can degenerate rapidly if the data are not appropriately normalized. This issue is even more apparent when DL is used for financial time series forecasting tasks, where the non-stationary and multimodal nature of the data pose significant challenges and severely affect the performance of DL models. In this work, a simple, yet effective, neural layer, that is capable of adaptively normalizing the input time series, while taking into account the distribution of the data, is proposed. The proposed layer is trained in an end-to-end fashion using back-propagation and can lead to significant performance improvements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a large-scale limit order book dataset.

**Continuous Outlier Mining of Streaming Data in Flink**

In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers in a metric space, where the status of an entity as to whether it is an outlier is based on the number of other entities in its neighborhood. In recent years, several solutions have tackled the problem of distance-based outliers in data streams, where outliers must be mined continuously as new elements become available. An interesting research problem is to combine the streaming environment with massively parallel systems to provide scalable streambased algorithms. However, none of the previously proposed techniques refer to a massively parallel setting. Our proposal fills this gap and investigates the challenges in transferring state-of-the-art techniques to Apache Flink, a modern platform for intensive streaming analytics. We thoroughly present the technical challenges encountered and the alternatives that may be applied. We show speed-ups of up to 117 (resp. 2076) times over a naive parallel (resp. non-parallel) solution in Flink, by using just an ordinary four-core machine and a real-world dataset. When moving to a three-machine cluster, due to less contention, we manage to achieve both better scalability in terms of the window slide size and the data dimensionality, and even higher speed-ups, e.g., by a factor of 510. Overall, our results demonstrate that oulier mining can be achieved in an efficient and scalable manner. The resulting techniques have been made publicly available as open-source software.

**An information criterion for auxiliary variable selection in incomplete data analysis**

Statistical inference is considered for variables of interest, called primary variables, when auxiliary variables are observed along with the primary variables. We consider the setting of incomplete data analysis, where some primary variables are not observed. Utilizing a parametric model of joint distribution of primary and auxiliary variables, it is possible to improve the estimation of parametric model for the primary variables when the auxiliary variables are closely related to the primary variables. However, the estimation accuracy reduces when the auxiliary variables are irrelevant to the primary variables. For selecting useful auxiliary variables, we formulate the problem as model selection, and propose an information criterion for predicting primary variables by leveraging auxiliary variables. The proposed information criterion is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence for complete data of primary variables under some reasonable conditions. We also clarify an asymptotic equivalence between the proposed information criterion and a variant of leave-one-out cross validation. Performance of our method is demonstrated via a simulation study and a real data example.

**Deep Learning Multidimensional Projections**

Dimensionality reduction methods, also known as projections, are frequently used for exploring multidimensional data in machine learning, data science, and information visualization. Among these, t-SNE and its variants have become very popular for their ability to visually separate distinct data clusters. However, such methods are computationally expensive for large datasets, suffer from stability problems, and cannot directly handle out-of-sample data. We propose a learning approach to construct such projections. We train a deep neural network based on a collection of samples from a given data universe, and their corresponding projections, and next use the network to infer projections of data from the same, or similar, universes. Our approach generates projections with similar characteristics as the learned ones, is computationally two to three orders of magnitude faster than SNE-class methods, has no complex-to-set user parameters, handles out-of-sample data in a stable manner, and can be used to learn any projection technique. We demonstrate our proposal on several real-world high dimensional datasets from machine learning.

**Multi-Player Bandits: The Adversarial Case**

We consider a setting where multiple players sequentially choose among a common set of actions (arms). Motivated by a cognitive radio networks application, we assume that players incur a loss upon colliding, and that communication between players is not possible. Existing approaches assume that the system is stationary. Yet this assumption is often violated in practice, e.g., due to signal strength fluctuations. In this work, we design the first Multi-player Bandit algorithm that provably works in arbitrarily changing environments, where the losses of the arms may even be chosen by an adversary. This resolves an open problem posed by Rosenski, Shamir, and Szlak (2016).

**Deep Short Text Classification with Knowledge Powered Attention**

Short text classification is one of important tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Unlike paragraphs or documents, short texts are more ambiguous since they have not enough contextual information, which poses a great challenge for classification. In this paper, we retrieve knowledge from external knowledge source to enhance the semantic representation of short texts. We take conceptual information as a kind of knowledge and incorporate it into deep neural networks. For the purpose of measuring the importance of knowledge, we introduce attention mechanisms and propose deep Short Text Classification with Knowledge powered Attention (STCKA). We utilize Concept towards Short Text (C- ST) attention and Concept towards Concept Set (C-CS) attention to acquire the weight of concepts from two aspects. And we classify a short text with the help of conceptual information. Unlike traditional approaches, our model acts like a human being who has intrinsic ability to make decisions based on observation (i.e., training data for machines) and pays more attention to important knowledge. We also conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets for different tasks. The experimental results and case studies show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, justifying the effectiveness of knowledge powered attention.

**Statistics and Samples in Distributional Reinforcement Learning**

We present a unifying framework for designing and analysing distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in terms of recursively estimating statistics of the return distribution. Our key insight is that DRL algorithms can be decomposed as the combination of some statistical estimator and a method for imputing a return distribution consistent with that set of statistics. With this new understanding, we are able to provide improved analyses of existing DRL algorithms as well as construct a new algorithm (EDRL) based upon estimation of the expectiles of the return distribution. We compare EDRL with existing methods on a variety of MDPs to illustrate concrete aspects of our analysis, and develop a deep RL variant of the algorithm, ER-DQN, which we evaluate on the Atari-57 suite of games.

**A Mean Field Theory of Batch Normalization**

We develop a mean field theory for batch normalization in fully-connected feedforward neural networks. In so doing, we provide a precise characterization of signal propagation and gradient backpropagation in wide batch-normalized networks at initialization. We find that gradient signals grow exponentially in depth and that these exploding gradients cannot be eliminated by tuning the initial weight variances or by adjusting the nonlinear activation function. Indeed, batch normalization itself is the cause of gradient explosion. As a result, vanilla batch-normalized networks without skip connections are not trainable at large depths for common initialization schemes, a prediction that we verify with a variety of empirical simulations. While gradient explosion cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by tuning the network close to the linear regime, which improves the trainability of deep batch-normalized networks without residual connections. Finally, we investigate the learning dynamics of batch-normalized networks and observe that after a single step of optimization the networks achieve a relatively stable equilibrium in which gradients have dramatically smaller dynamic range.

**Domain Partitioning Network**

Standard adversarial training involves two agents, namely a generator and a discriminator, playing a mini-max game. However, even if the players converge to an equilibrium, the generator may only recover a part of the target data distribution, in a situation commonly referred to as mode collapse. In this work, we present the Domain Partitioning Network (DoPaNet), a new approach to deal with mode collapse in generative adversarial learning. We employ multiple discriminators, each encouraging the generator to cover a different part of the target distribution. To ensure these parts do not overlap and collapse into the same mode, we add a classifier as a third agent in the game. The classifier decides which discriminator the generator is trained against for each sample. Through experiments on toy examples and real images, we show the merits of DoPaNet in covering the real distribution and its superiority with respect to the competing methods. Besides, we also show that we can control the modes from which samples are generated using DoPaNet.

**Evaluating the Search Phase of Neural Architecture Search**

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to facilitate the design of deep networks for new tasks. Existing techniques rely on two stages: searching over the architecture space and validating the best architecture. Evaluating NAS algorithms is currently solely done by comparing their results on the downstream task. While intuitive, this fails to explicitly evaluate the effectiveness of their search strategies. In this paper, we extend the NAS evaluation procedure to include the search phase. To this end, we compare the quality of the solutions obtained by NAS search policies with that of random architecture selection. We find that: (i) On average, the random policy outperforms state-of-the-art NAS algorithms; and (ii) The results and candidate rankings of NAS algorithms do not reflect the true performance of the candidate architectures. While our former finding illustrates the fact that the NAS search space has been sufficiently constrained so that random solutions yield good results, we trace the latter back to the weight sharing strategy used by state-of-the-art NAS methods. In contrast with common belief, weight sharing negatively impacts the training of good architectures, thus reducing the effectiveness of the search process. We believe that following our evaluation framework will be key to designing NAS strategies that truly discover superior architectures.

**Learned Step Size Quantization**

We present here Learned Step Size Quantization, a method for training deep networks such that they can run at inference time using low precision integer matrix multipliers, which offer power and space advantages over high precision alternatives. The essence of our approach is to learn the step size parameter of a uniform quantizer by backpropagation of the training loss, applying a scaling factor to its learning rate, and computing its associated loss gradient by ignoring the discontinuity present in the quantizer. This quantization approach can be applied to activations or weights, using different levels of precision as needed for a given system, and requiring only a simple modification of existing training code. As demonstrated on the ImageNet dataset, our approach achieves better accuracy than all previous published methods for creating quantized networks on several ResNet network architectures at 2-, 3- and 4-bits of precision.

**Topology of Learning in Artificial Neural Networks**

Understanding how neural networks learn remains one of the central challenges in machine learning research. From random at the start of training, the weights of a neural network evolve in such a way as to be able to perform a variety of tasks, like classifying images. Here we study the emergence of structure in the weights by applying methods from topological data analysis. We train simple feedforward neural networks on the MNIST dataset and monitor the evolution of the weights. When initialized to zero, the weights follow trajectories that branch off recurrently, thus generating trees that describe the growth of the effective capacity of each layer. When initialized to tiny random values, the weights evolve smoothly along two-dimensional surfaces. We show that natural coordinates on these learning surfaces correspond to important factors of variation.
