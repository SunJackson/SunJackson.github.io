A new RcppArmadillo release based on a new Armadillo upstream release arrived on CRAN and Debian today.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 583 other packages on CRAN.

The (upstream-only this time) changes are listed below:

> 
Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.9.300.2.0 (2019-03-21)


Upgraded to Armadillo release 9.300.2 (Fomo Spiral)


Faster handling of compound complex matrix expressions by `trace()`


More efficient handling of element access for inplace modifications in sparse matrices


Added `.is_sympd()` to check whether a matrix is symmetric/hermitian positive definite


Added `interp2()` for 2D data interpolation


Added `expm1()` and `log1p()`


Expanded `.is_sorted()` with options "strictascend" and "strictdescend"


Expanded `eig_gen()` to optionally perform balancing prior to decomposition






Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
