Back in November 2018 we announced on this blog that the same machine learning (ML) courses used to train engineers at Amazon are now available to all developers through AWS. Today, we’re letting you know that there is a way to enhance and validate your ability to build, train, tune, and deploy machine learning models with AWS.

AWS Training and Certification is excited to announce the availability of the new AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty certification. This new exam was created by AWS experts for developers and data scientists who want to validate their ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain ML solutions for given business problems. In addition, it validates their ability to select and justify the appropriate ML approach for a given business problem, identify appropriate AWS services to implement ML solutions, and design and implement scalable, cost-optimized, reliable, and secure ML solutions. AWS Training and Certification recommends one or more years of hands-on experience using ML  and artificial intelligence (AI) services, particularly Amazon SageMaker, and other services such as Amazon EMR, AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, and Amazon S3. It is also encouraged, but not required, that candidates hold an Associate-level certification or the Cloud Practitioner certification.

I had a chance to catch up with Swami Sivasubramanian, who is the Vice President of Machine Learning at AWS, to hear his thoughts on the needs in this growing field. “Customers tell us that they need more skilled talent in the area of machine learning, which has been a familiar problem within Amazon as well. It’s why we invested so deeply in creating internal education to train developers on machine learning,” he said. “AWS Training and Certification is helping to put those same resources in the hands of our customers so that they can develop and validate skills among their staff which will enable them to take full advantage of the growing AI/ML suite from AWS and the transformational effect that this technology will have on organizations and the global economy.”

Your ability to build, train, tune, and deploy ML models opens up many opportunities for new business ideas, new employment opportunities, and new customer experiences. Are you ready to get started?

### Next Steps

The exam is available in English and Japanese at testing centers worldwide for $300 USD. You can learn more about the exam here. AWS offers an exam guide which provides training resources and materials to help you prepare. In addition, a learning path, called “Exam Preparation,” specifically designed for those taking the exam is available at aws.training/machinelearning.
