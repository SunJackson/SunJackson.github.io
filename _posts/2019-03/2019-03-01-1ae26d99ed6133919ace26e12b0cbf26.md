Let's say you've developed a predictive model in R, and you want to embed predictions (scores) from that model into another application (like a mobile or Web app, or some automated service). If you expect a heavy load of requests, R running on a single server isn't going to cut it: you'll need some kind of distributed architecture with enough servers to handle the volume of requests in real time.

This reference architecture for real-time scoring with R, published in Microsoft Docs, describes a Kubernetes-based system to distribute the load to R sessions running in containers. This diagram from the article provides a good overview:

You can find detailed instructions for deploying this architecture in Github. This architecture uses Azure-specific components, but you could also use their open source equivalents if you wanted to host them yourself:

For more details on this architecture, take a look at the Microsoft Docs article linked below.
