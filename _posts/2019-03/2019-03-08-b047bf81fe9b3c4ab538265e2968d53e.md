AI and Machine Learning can only benefit from increasing diversity and participation of women. We hope that the example of the amazing women below will continue to inspire more women to join this field.


Check also our 2018 post 18 Inspiring Women In AI, Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning. It was well received, but we received many comments about other inspiring women not included in that list.


So here is a brand new 2019 list of more amazing women in this field.
