**Ensemble Clustering Algorithm for Graphs (ECG)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose an ensemble clustering algorithm for graphs (ECG), which is based on the Louvain algorithm and the concept of consensus clustering. We validate our approach by replicating a recently published study comparing graph clustering algorithms over artificial networks, showing that ECG outperforms the leading algorithms from that study. We also illustrate how the ensemble obtained with ECG can be used to quantify the presence of community structure in the graph. … 

**Object-Driven Attentive Generative Adversarial Newtork (Obj-GAN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we propose Object-driven Attentive Generative Adversarial Newtorks (Obj-GANs) that allow object-centered text-to-image synthesis for complex scenes. Following the two-step (layout-image) generation process, a novel object-driven attentive image generator is proposed to synthesize salient objects by paying attention to the most relevant words in the text description and the pre-generated semantic layout. In addition, a new Fast R-CNN based object-wise discriminator is proposed to provide rich object-wise discrimination signals on whether the synthesized object matches the text description and the pre-generated layout. The proposed Obj-GAN significantly outperforms the previous state of the art in various metrics on the large-scale COCO benchmark, increasing the Inception score by 27% and decreasing the FID score by 11%. A thorough comparison between the traditional grid attention and the new object-driven attention is provided through analyzing their mechanisms and visualizing their attention layers, showing insights of how the proposed model generates complex scenes in high quality. … 

**Graph Processing Framework for Large Dynamic Graphs (BLADYG)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recently, distributed processing of large dynamic graphs has become very popular, especially in certain domains such as social network analysis, Web graph analysis and spatial network analysis. In this context, many distributed/parallel graph processing systems have been proposed, such as Pregel, GraphLab, and Trinity. These systems can be divided into two categories: (1) vertex-centric and (2) block-centric approaches. In vertex-centric approaches, each vertex corresponds to a process, and message are exchanged among vertices. In block-centric approaches, the unit of computation is a block, a connected subgraph of the graph, and message exchanges occur among blocks. In this paper, we are considering the issues of scale and dynamism in the case of block-centric approaches. We present bladyg, a block-centric framework that addresses the issue of dynamism in large-scale graphs. We present an implementation of BLADYG on top of akka framework. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. …
