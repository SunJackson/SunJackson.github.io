## 1. Be Honest

Try not to exaggerate your skills. If the job sounds more engineering focused than you are wanting, be honest and say that. Data Science is getting very broad and you don’t want to get in a position that is a bad fit.

You often sound worse when you try to explain something you do not understand. Just be honest and say, “I have not needed to use that yet, can you explain to me when you have done that?” 

Find the job you are looking for, not just any position someone is trying to fill.

## 2. Tell Stories of Your work

Talk about things you have built. If you built something as part of a team or project, tell about why and your involvement. 

If you have a side project, talk about that. This is why side-projects are so important. They help you learn a lot, plus they give you something exciting to talk about, which only you can talk about. 

## 3. Practice

Interviews are intimidating. There is really no way to avoid that. The best you can do is be prepared for the interview. **Pramp **provides a platform for practicing data science interviews. Practice makes perfect.
