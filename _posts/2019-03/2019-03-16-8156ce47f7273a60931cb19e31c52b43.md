**Altham-Poisson Distribution** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The multiplicative binomial model was introduced as a generalization of the binomial distribution for modelling correlated binomial data. This distribution has not been extensively explored and is revisited in the present study. Some properties of the multiplicative binomial distribution, such as, expressions for the factorial moments and the information matrix, are investigated. The distribution is also extended to accommodate data arising from a Wadley’s problem setting which is frequently encountered in dose-mortality studies and is one in which the number of organisms initially treated with a drug is unobserved. The Altham-Poisson distribution is introduced by modelling the unobserved initial number of organisms, as specified by Formula in the multiplicative binomial model, with a Poisson distribution and its suitability for overdispersed data from a Wadley’s problem setting is explored. … 

**SAPS** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Program synthesis from natural language (NL) is practical for humans and, once technically feasible, would significantly facilitate software development and revolutionize end-user programming. We present SAPS, an end-to-end neural network capable of mapping relatively complex, multi-sentence NL specifications to snippets of executable code. The proposed architecture relies exclusively on neural components, and is built upon a tree2tree autoencoder trained on abstract syntax trees, combined with a pretrained word embedding and a bi-directional multi-layer LSTM for NL processing. The decoder features a doubly-recurrent LSTM with a novel signal propagation scheme and soft attention mechanism. When applied to a large dataset of problems proposed in a previous study, SAPS performs on par with or better than the method proposed there, producing correct programs in over 90% of cases. In contrast to other methods, it does not involve any non-neural components to post-process the resulting programs, and uses a fixed-dimensional latent representation as the only link between the NL analyzer and source code generator. … 

**Confirmatory Research** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Confirmatory research sets out to test a specific hypothesis to the exclusion of other considerations; whereas discovery research seeks to find out what might be important in understanding a research context, presenting findings as conjectural (e.g., suggestive, indicative) rather than definite’ (Taber, 2013: 45)![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)
