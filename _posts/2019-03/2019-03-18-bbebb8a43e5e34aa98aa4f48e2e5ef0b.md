Today is a big day â€” **I’m formally announcing that I’m writing a brand new book on *Computer Vision with the Raspberry Pi.***

I’ve been wanting to write this book for *years*, arguably ever since I started playing around with the Raspberry Pi and OpenCV.

But the timing never worked out quite right.

I was either:

- Wrapping up other books or courses

- Busy with existing projects that needed to be completed

- Pulled in too many directions at once, not having the mental bandwidth and capacity to work with *both* the Raspberry Pi hardware and Computer Vision software at the same time


But deep down I wanted to write this book and make it come to life.

On my yearly retreat in late 2018/early 2019 the stars aligned. I looked at my project plans, my commitments for the year, and took stock of my mental bandwidth. All three were a *“go”* â€” **I decided the Raspberry Pi + Computer Vision book would be written and published in 2019.**

Since that decision, myself and the PyImageSearch team have been writing code and putting together projects for the book.

**We’ve put together code for chapters that will enable you to:**

- **Build practical, real-world computer vision applications** on the Raspberry Pi

- Create **Computer Vision and Internet of Things (IoT)** projects and applications with the Raspberry Pi

- **Optimize your OpenCV code and algorithms** on the resource constrained Pi

- Perform **Deep Learning** on the Raspberry Pi (including utilizing the **Movidius NCS** and **OpenVINO toolkit**)

- **Create self-driving car applications** with a Raspberry Pi


***But before I can publish the book, I need your help first…***

To start, I haven’t finalized the name of the book yet. I’ll be sending out an email with a survey to nail down the book title in the next few days, so if you’re interested in helping to name the book, *keep an eye on your inbox.*

After the book has been named I’ll be launching a Kickstarter campaign in ***mid-April 2019*** to finish funding the Raspberry Pi + Computer Vision book.

**I fully intend on not only *completing* the book but also *publishing* it in *Autumn 2019.***

To learn more about the upcoming Computer Vision and Raspberry Pi book, and more importantly, **lend your opinion to help shape the future of the book,** just keep reading.

## I need your advice on my upcoming Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision book

**Figure 1:** I’m writing a new book on Computer Vision on the Raspberry Pi.

I value your opinion, as a PyImageSearch reader, more than anything else â€” **I want to create content that you’ll not only *enjoy* but also get *tremendous value out of.***

Any successful writer, entrepreneur, or business owner (especially in a highly technical field) will tell you the importance of **sharing what you’re doing/building with your audience *well before it’s finished*** so they can provide you with feedback, input, and insights.

The *last* thing you would want to do is build a product/write a book that no one wants, uses, or reads.

I’m no different â€” **I want to make sure you get value out of everything I create.**

**In order to make this Computer Vision + Raspberry Pi book a success, *I need your help.***

In the remainder of this post I’ve included a *rough outline/description* of what I plan to cover in this upcoming book.

The outline is *by no means complete and finalized* but I believe it does accurately reflect what will be covered. Chapters will certainly be modified and added during the writing process.

Take a look at this list of topics. Then be sure to either send me an email, shoot me a message, or reply in the comments section at the bottom of this post with your feedback and suggestions.

## What are the prerequisites for this book?

In an effort to keep this book as practical and hands-on as possible, I am trying to keep the prerequisites at a minimum.

**At the very least you should:**

1. Have basic programming knowledge and experience

1. Know the fundamentals of computer vision and the OpenCV library


Basically, if you have either (1) read through *Practical Python and OpenCV* or (2) can follow tutorials here on PyImageSearch, *you have all the prerequisites you need.*

If you’ve gone through the PyImageSearch Gurus course you’ll be able to pick up the algorithms used inside the text in a snap.

And if you’ve worked through my deep learning book, *Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python*, you’ll be able to more easily train your own deep learning models (and then deploy them to the Pi).

If you haven’t worked through any of my books or courses, *don’t worry,* I’ll help get you the resources and guides you to need to be successful applying computer vision to the Raspberry Pi.

My point here is simple â€” don’t get too hung up on the book prerequisites. The simple fact is this:

**Inside the text you’ll learn how to apply computer vision and deep learning concepts on the Raspberry Pi, *regardless of your experience level.***

It doesn’t matter if you are *new to computer vision* or a *seasoned computer vision practitioner)*, you *will* find tremendous value in this book, I guarantee that.

## What is going to be covered in the Raspberry Pi + Computer Vision book?
![](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pi_book_example_cover.jpg)


**Figure 2:** Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision. What is the book going to cover?

My general plan for the upcoming book is to focus on developing computer vision and deep learning applications for the Raspberry Pi (including IoT projects).

Inside the text you’ll not only learn how to *develop the algorithms* but also *optimize them*, ensuring you get every last little drop of performance out of the Raspberry Pi.

The book itself will be **detailed**, but also **super hands-on** and **highly practical.**

If you’re a follower of the PyImageSearch blog you know that I’m a big fan of *“learning by doing”*. Each chapter will include **highly documented,** **thoroughly explained source code**, giving you the tools and implementations you need to successfully create computer vision projects on the Raspberry Pi.

When appropriate I’ll also be including academic citations, references to current state-of-the-art work, and cross-references to other relevant PyImageSearch tutorials and blog posts.

As for the structure of the book, I’ll be breaking it into “tiers/bundles”, just like I do for *Practical Python and OpenCV* and *Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python.*

By breaking the book into tiers I’ll be able to enable you (the reader) to select the tier that best fits:

1. Your particular needs

1. Your budget


This means that if you just want to test the waters of the Raspberry Pi and computer vision you’ll be able to purchase a cheaper, more affordable tier.

And if you already have a good amount of experience with computer vision (or if you simply want the *complete package*), and want to learn more advanced techniques, you’ll be able to purchase the higher tier bundles.

I haven’t fully defined where the “line” will be drawn separating the tiers/bundles (although I have a pretty good idea), but below you can find the list of topics I plan on covering.

If you have any suggestions on additional chapters, please either send me an email, shoot me a message, or simply comment on this post using the form at the bottom of the page.

## Why a Kickstarter campaign?
![](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pi_book_kickstarter.jpg)


**Figure 3:** The Computer Vision and Raspberry Pi book Kickstarter will go live in mid-April.

I’ll be sharing more details on the upcoming Kickstarter campaign for the new Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision book in the coming weeks, but since I know I’ll get asked *“Why a Kickstarter campaign?”* I thought I would address it now.

**First, I’m a big fan of Kickstarter campaigns.**

They are a *great* way to spread the word about a project *beyond* the PyImageSearch audience. This enables me to *grow* PyImageSearch and *ensure I can continue creating content* (both free and paid) for years to come.

**Secondly, I have experience running two successful Kickstarter campaigns:**

**Both were *successfully funded* and *completed ahead of schedule.***

Without the Kickstarter campaigns I would not have the funds necessary to dedicate my time to coding the examples, writing the text, editing it, and putting together the final product.

**In the context of this computer vision and Raspberry Pi book, I’ll be running the Kickstarter campaign to help pay for my time, Raspberry Pi hardware, server costs, and editing costs.**

While the Raspberry Pi and associated hardware are typically cheap (a Pi only costs $35), keep in mind that:

- **I utilize *many* Raspberry Pi’s,** making it faster and more efficient to put this book together (and ultimately get it in *your* hands faster).

- **I’m purchasing, evaluating, and testing additional hardware for the Pi,** ensuring I can give you the best possible recommendations to create successful computer vision and deep learning applications on the Pi.

- **I have AWS/Azure cloud expenses.** Some chapters inside the Raspberry Pi + Computer Vision book will utilize deep learning models. I’m training my own networks in the cloud which I will then give to you once the book is complete (but the cloud bill still needs to be paid).

- **I have to pay for *two sets* of editors.** It takes two editors to create successful technical book/courses here on PyImageSearch. The first editor addresses spelling and grammar while the second editor ensures the technical aspects of the text are not only *correct* but *reproducible*. The second type of editing in particular is what sets PyImageSearch apart from other websites and ensures super high quality books/courses (and that editing isn’t cheap either).

- **I need to ensure my own time is paid for.** It takes *a lot* of time to author a single (free) tutorial here on PyImageSearch. I put even *more *effort into content that I charge for (such as my books and courses). Funds from the Kickstarter will ensure that not only the book is completed successfully and on time, but that I can continue to produce free content on the PyImageSearch blog.


**All these expenses really add up** and up until this point I’ve been putting all of the book expenses on my credit card.

After authoring three successful books/courses, I can assure you, creating a high quality book is *not* cheap â€” I need the additional funds to pay for the rest of the book creation.

Along with updates on the Raspberry Pi + Computer Vision book, within the next few days I’ll also be sending out a short survey to help ***name the book*** â€” keep an eye on your inbox, **I really need your input!**

## Keep in mind: I am writing this book for *you.*

Everything I do here on the PyImageSearch blog is for you, the reader.

Whether that’s authoring free tutorials or creating a brand new book/course, all of it is for YOU.

If you see any topics that you would like to be included in the book, either email me, send me a message, or post in the comments section at the bottom of this page.

I cannot guarantee that I’ll be able to accommodate all (or even most) of the requests and suggestions, but I will do my absolute best to consider all opinions/suggestions to help make this the ***BEST*** computer vision and Raspberry Pi book available today.

Keep an eye on your inbox for the book title survey email, otherwise I’ll be back in a couple weeks with the finalized details on the Kickstarter campaign and book topics list.
