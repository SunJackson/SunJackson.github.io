The best way to see how evolution works, is to watch it in action! You can watch the evolution of cars live in this application (but be careful, it’s addictive): BoxCar 2D

It is fascinating to see how those cars get better and better over time, sometimes finding very impressive solutions:

To understand how evolution works even better, let us create an artificial evolution in R!

The famous evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins gave in his book “The Blind Watchmaker” the following thought experiment:

> 
I don’t know who it was first pointed out that, given enough time, a monkey bashing away at random on a typewriter could produce all the works of Shakespeare. The operative phrase is, of course, given enough time. Let us limit the task facing our monkey somewhat. Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but just the short sentence ‘Methinks it is like a weasel’, and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?


We are now going to put this idea into practice! The following outline is from the Wikipedia article on the weasel program (Weasel program):

1. Start with a random string of 28 characters.

1. Make 100 copies of the string (reproduce).

1. For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (mutate) the character with a new random character.

1. Compare each new string with the target string “METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL”, and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).

1. If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.


So let us first define some variables and helper functions for *reproduction*, *mutation* and *fitness* calculation:

After that we are going through all five steps listed above:

As you can see, the algorithm arrived at the target phrase pretty quickly. Now, you can try to tweak different parameter setting, like the population size or the mutation rate, and see what happens. You can of course also change the target phrase.

A minority of (often very religious) people reject the fact of evolution because they miss a crucial step: selection based on fitness. Selection gives evolution direction towards solutions that are better able to solve a certain problem. It is the exact opposite of pure randomness which many people still suspect behind evolution.

To see the difference the only thing we have to do is to comment out the line`pop <- reproduce(highscorer)` which selects the highest scoring string for reproduction. We can see that without selection there is no improvement to be seen and the algorithm would run “forever”:

If this was how evolution really worked it wouldn’t work at all.

Because evolution is a very powerful *optimization* method there are also real world applications of so called *genetic algorithms* (GA). In the following example we want to find the *global optimum* of the so called Rastrigin function. What makes this task especially difficult for this popular test problem is the large number of *local minima*, as can be seen when plotting the function:

To find the global minimum (spoiler: it is at ![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2eaeabbd456939b87d1d5491c9501612_l3.png?resize=38%2C18)

) we use the GA package (because `GA` only maximizes we use the minus sign in front of the fitness function):

Quite impressive, isn’t it! Evolution just works!

In an upcoming post we will use evolutionary methods to find a nice functional form for some noisy data with a method called *symbolic regression* or *genetic programming* – so stay tuned!
