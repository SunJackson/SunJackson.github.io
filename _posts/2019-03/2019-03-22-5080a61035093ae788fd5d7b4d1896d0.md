Thank you to Win-Vector LLC General Partner Nina Zumel for stepping up her workload, allowing me take some time off from Win-Vector LLC (and time off from from revising chapter 8 of *Practical Data Science with R 2nd Edition*) to make time to help administer the Vietnam Rotary Global Grant mentioned below. This project is going to help over 1,600 farmers in Vietnam.

Heidi Kühn is a remarkable individual, and Roots of Peace and Rotary are remarkable organizations. It is an honor to work with all of you.

As with all projects- it feels like my part (the paperwork and supervision) is back under control. So back to research, clients, and the book (until something more is needed).
