**What are the Industries / Fields where you applied Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning in 2018?**


Notably, CRM/Consumer Analytics remains number 1, which it has been for the last 5 years. Health care made a jump to number 2 from number 4 last year. Conversely, finance dropped to number 4 from number 2; however, these are small percentage differences in the share, and so are not statistically significant.


The top 5 industries were:

**CRM/Consumer analytics**, 18.6%
**Health care**, 17.2%
**Banking**, 17.0%
**Finance**, 16.1%
**Science**, 13.6%

Social Policy / Survey analysis, 2.5% in 2018, up 61.1% from 2017

The most significant decreases over the same period were:

Fraud Detection, 10.6% in 2018, down 18.7% from 2017
Retail, 9.4% in 2018, down 15.9% from 2017

Social Media / Social Networks, 6.0% in 2018, down 11.1% from 2017

Once again, the average number of industries/areas per voter remained quite consistent. There was a small bump this year to 3.0 per participant, as compared with 2.7 in both last year's poll (2017) and 2016, and only a slight change from 2.65 in 2015. This may bolster Gregory Piatetsky's comment from last year's poll analysis: "Perhaps there is a limit to effective application of Data Science across industries?"
