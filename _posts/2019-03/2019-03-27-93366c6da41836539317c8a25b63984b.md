or more precisely *union* many spatial tables in R in a tidy way.

- dplyr::bind_rows doesn’t work on sf objects ; 

- base::rbind only work on two tables and so that’s not straightforward to use*.


So we’ll use purrr::map and tidyr::unnest.

First get some data, the communes of three french départements :

We can then create a 3 rows data frame containing a list-column in which we store the sf object. Then we just unnest it. This operation erases the sf-class, we have to add it back.

Bonus : we have the source filename stored in the resulting shapefile.

* We could have used

but the column structure doesn’t match here…
