When accessing an API or database in R, it is often necessary to provide credentials such as a login name and password. You may find yourself being prompted with something like this:

When writing an R script that requires a user to provide credentials, you will want a way to have the script prompt the user or, better yet, programatically provided the credentials in the R script. Either way, be careful! You don’t want to put your credentials out there in the clear for all the world to see. Best practices emphatically state:

> 
As with every programming language, it is important to **avoid publishing code with your credentials in plain text**.


So, how can we provide credentials without putting them in the script itself? There are a variety of options described in RStudio’s “Databases using R”.

I will focus on two cases:

simply prompting for credentials via `rstudioapi`

- suitable for simple credential management


- suitable for more complicated credential management


### Prompting for a username and password

If an R Script requires only one set of credentials and those credentials are easy to remember, it may be easiest to prompt the user for them using `rstudioapi`. A typical example would be prompting users for their username and password to access a corporate database:

```
username <- rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database username")
password <- rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")

```

This method may also be convenient if the user’s credentials tend to change over time.

### The R Keyring package

A more sophisticated option is to use the R `keyring` package to store and access encrypted credentials locally. This might be more suitable if multiple credentials exist to access a variety of services (think multiple access tokens). With `keyring`, one password unlocks the keyring which then provides access to all the credentials.

To use the `keyring` package, a user only needs to to install and load the package and define three strings: the keyring name, a keyring service, and the username that we want to associate our secret credentials with.

The following example shows how to create a keyring name `my_keyring`, with credentials to access `my_database` as `my_username`. We first create a `backend_file` type of keyring which will store the encrypted credentials in the user’s home directory ( `~/.config/r-keyring`). With `keyring_create`, we prompt for the password that will unlock the keyring. Finally, we store a credential in the keyring with `set` before locking it with `keyring_lock`.

```
library(keyring)

# Set variables to be used in keyring.
kr_name <- "my_keyring"
kr_service <- "my_database"
kr_username <- "my_username"

# Create a keyring and add an entry using the variables above
kb <- keyring::backend_file$new()
# Prompt for the keyring password, used to unlock keyring
kb$keyring_create(kr_name)
# Prompt for the credential to be stored in the keyring
kb$set(kr_service, username=kr_username, keyring=kr_name)
# Lock the keyring
kb$keyring_lock(kr_name)

# The encrypted keyring file is now stored at ~/.config/r-keyring/ and can be
# accessed by any R program that provides the keyring password

```

We can store credentials for multiple usernames per service, and multiple services per keyring. This is ideal in the case of an application that must access a variety of services via access tokens. The encrypted credentials file can either be published with the code, or perhaps for extra security, distributed via a separate channel.

To retrieve credentials, set the same three variables and use the `keyring` `get()` function, which will prompt us for the keyring password that we set when we called `create`. A retrieval script might look like this:

```
library(keyring)
library(DBI)

# Set variables to be used in keyring.
kr_name <- "my_keyring"
kr_service <- "my_database"
kr_username <- "my_username"

# Output the stored password: normally you would not want to do this
keyring::backend_file$new()$get(service = kr_service,
 user = kr_username,
 keyring = kr_name)


# Establish connection to Teradata retrieving the password from the keyring.
dbConnect(drv = odbc::odbc(),
 dsn = "my_dsn", # set DSN options in ~/.odbc.ini
 pwd = keyring::backend_file$new()$get(service = kr_service,
 user = kr_username,
 keyring = kr_name))


```

With this, we are able to retrieve arbitrary credentials for a particular username and service, allowing us to manage much more complicated sets of credentials with a single password.

So, which is the best way to ensure that plain text credentials are not published with code? If your code relies on a limited number of credentials, an interactive prompt may be the more suitable choice: code users know what their username and password are and can easily enter them interactively.

If the code requires multiple, hard-to-remember, or cumbersome to provide credentials, you might want to consider using keyrings. Users will only need to provide one password, which will unlock the keyring and provide access to all credentials.
