Known user identity when building shiny apps can sometimes come really handy. While you can implement your own user login, for instance using cookies, you can also use some of the services which authenticate a user for you, such as Google. This way, you don’t have to handle cookies or passwords, just a small part of bureaucracy in your database.

Enter googleAuthR. You can use the Google Authentication system, which enables you to call its APIs (e.g. see here), but sometimes a user login is just enough. This is where the accompanying module `googleSignIn` comes into play. Below is how I was able to implement this same name module with four lines of code, one line being loading the aforementioned library.

If you would be kind enough to scroll to the `googleSignIn` part of the page, you will notice code for a shiny app that (almost) just works. Read on to see what I mean by “almost”.

The demo app has all the key components, it loads libraries, prepares `options("client_id")`, creates sign in button in `ui` (`googleSignInUI("demo")`), does the auth dance for you in the `server` part (`shiny::callModule(googleSignIn, "demo")`) when this button is pressed and, as gratis, displays the name, email and your google image. I run the app using `runApp(port = 1221)`!

When I press the Sign in button, I get – bleh. Doesn’t work.

What is going on? The google console parameters check out.

Let me save you hours of clicking by pointing out this little bit from the documentation from the `googleAuth` module:

> 
… then make sure if you launch your app locally to change the ip address from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` in your browser (Google doesn’t accept ip addresses).


In other words, in your web browser, just change `http://127.0.0.1:1221` to `http://localhost:1221`. The page should reload on its own. Click the sign in button et voilà.
