**A rigorous hands-on introduction to data science for engineers.**


Win Vector LLC is now offering a 4 day on-site intensive data science course. The course targets engineers familiar with Python and introduces them to the basics of current data science practice. This is designed as an interactive in-person (not remote or video) course.




The course includes lectures, hands-on labs, and optional homework exercises. Students are expected to attend a 4 full days, and will come out with a basic understanding of some of the most important tools for supervised learning in data science. We share all course materials, which the students can use as starting points for their own projects. Students are expected to bring a laptop with a Python 3 configured version of Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) so they can work along with the lectures, and also work on labs and exercises. The topics are designed for an engineering audience. This is for an audience comfortable with Python, and interested in learning the basics of data manipulation and starting with supervised machine learning.


Topics covered:

- **Day1:**Starting with data and statistics
