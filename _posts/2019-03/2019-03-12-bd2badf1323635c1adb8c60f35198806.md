In this post we will see that a little bit of simple R code can go a very long way! So let’s get started!

One of the fascinating features of number theory (unlike many other branches of mathematics) is that many statements are easy to make but the brightest minds are not able to prove them, the so called *Collatz conjecture* (named after the German mathematician *Lothar Collatz*) is an especially fascinating example:

The Collatz conjecture states that when you start with any positive integer and, 

- if it is even, the next number is one half the previous number and, 

- if it is odd, the next number is three times the previous number plus one


the sequence will always reach one.

It doesn’t get any simpler than that but no one has been able to prove this – and not for a lack of trying! The great mathematician Paul Erdős said about it “Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.” You can read more on Wikipedia: Collatz conjecture and an especially nice film that was made by a group of students can be watched here: The Collatz Conjecture.

So let us write a little program and try some numbers!

First we need a simple helper function to determine whether a number is even:

Normally we wouldn’t use a dot within function names but R itself (because of its legacy code) is not totally consistent here and the `is`-function family (like `is.na` or `is.integer`) all use a dot. After that we write a function for the rule itself, making use of the `is.even` function:

To try a number and plot it (like in the Wikipedia article) we could use a `while`-loop:

As you can see, after a wild ride the sequence finally reaches one as expected. We end with some nerd humour from the cult website *xkcd*:
