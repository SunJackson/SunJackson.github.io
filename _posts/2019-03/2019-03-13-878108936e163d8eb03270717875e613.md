The R Core Team announced yesterday the release of R 3.5.3, and updated binaries for Windows and Linux are now available (with Mac sure to follow soon). This update fixes three minor bugs (to the functions `writeLines`, `setClassUnion`, and `stopifnot`), but you might want to upgrade just to avoid the "package built under R 3.5.4" warnings you might get for new CRAN packages in the future.

R releases typically reference the Peanuts cartoon, but the code-name for this release, "Great Truth", is somewhat of a mystery. There may be a clue in the release date, March 11. Anyone got any ideas?

For more details on this latest update to the R language, check out the announcement below. And as always, thanks to the members of the R Core Team for their contributions to all R users with the R project.
