**SemiPsm** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recent years have witnessed a surge of manipulation of public opinion and political events by malicious social media actors. These users are referred to as ‘Pathogenic Social Media (PSM)’ accounts. PSMs are key users in spreading misinformation in social media to viral proportions. These accounts can be either controlled by real users or automated bots. Identification of PSMs is thus of utmost importance for social media authorities. The burden usually falls to automatic approaches that can identify these accounts and protect social media reputation. However, lack of sufficient labeled examples for devising and training sophisticated approaches to combat these accounts is still one of the foremost challenges facing social media firms. In contrast, unlabeled data is abundant and cheap to obtain thanks to massive user-generated data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised causal inference PSM detection framework, SemiPsm, to compensate for the lack of labeled data. In particular, the proposed method leverages unlabeled data in the form of manifold regularization and only relies on cascade information. This is in contrast to the existing approaches that use exhaustive feature engineering (e.g., profile information, network structure, etc.). Evidence from empirical experiments on a real-world ISIS-related dataset from Twitter suggests promising results of utilizing unlabeled instances for detecting PSMs. … 

**User-Sensitive Recommendation Ensemble with Clustered Multi-Task Learning (UREC)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper considers recommendation algorithm ensembles in a user-sensitive manner. Recently researchers have proposed various effective recommendation algorithms, which utilized different aspects of the data and different techniques. However, the ‘user skewed prediction’ problem may exist for almost all recommendation algorithms — algorithms with best average predictive accuracy may cover up that the algorithms may perform poorly for some part of users, which will lead to biased services in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose a user-sensitive ensemble method named ‘UREC’ to address this issue. We first cluster users based on the recommendation predictions, then we use multi-task learning to learn the user-sensitive ensemble function for the users. In addition, to alleviate the negative effects of new user problem to clustering users, we propose an approximate approach based on a spectral relaxation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods. … 

**Knowledge Tracing Machine** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Knowledge tracing is a sequence prediction problem where the goal is to predict the outcomes of students over questions as they are interacting with a learning platform. By tracking the evolution of the knowledge of some student, one can optimize instruction. Existing methods are either based on temporal latent variable models, or factor analysis with temporal features. We here show that factorization machines (FMs), a model for regression or classification, encompass several existing models in the educational literature as special cases, notably additive factor model, performance factor model, and multidimensional item response theory. We show, using several real datasets of tens of thousands of users and items, that FMs can estimate student knowledge accurately and fast even when student data is sparsely observed, and handle side information such as multiple knowledge components and number of attempts at item or skill level. Our approach allows to fit student models of higher dimension than existing models, and provides a testbed to try new combinations of features in order to improve existing models. …
