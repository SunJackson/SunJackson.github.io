Itâ€™s been a dream of mine to break into the data science field, so prior to my move, I decided to add another project to my portfolio â€“ a sleek Shiny dashboard. 

 A brutal truth about this project was that I had to invest time in finding my own data and deciding what to do with it. Long story short, I found beeradvocate.org and scraped the Milwaukee-centric subset of it over multiple iterations to build up my dataset. I then combined the information on their local breweries, beers, and ratings/reviews.

 Along the way I also discovered `highcharter`, an amazing library for interactive plots. (If you havenâ€™t heard of it, look it up!) First, let me provide an example of a highcharter plot I used in my dashboard. I hope it will invoke your curiosity and ultimately lure you to my app that helps explore Milwaukeeâ€™s rich array of beers!

```
library(tidyverse)
library(highcharter)
library(readr)

##You can find this data on my github:
## https://github.com/Jjohn987/anything_data/blob/master/public/post/milwaukee_beer3.csv

milwaukee_beer <- read_csv("milwaukee_beer3.csv")[-1] 
 
 milwaukees_favorite <- milwaukee_beer %>%
 select(brewery, beer_name, avg_beer_score,
 beer_style,
 beer_category) %>%
 distinct() %>%
 filter(!is.na(beer_category)) %>%
 group_by(beer_category) %>%
 summarise(total = n(), avg = mean(avg_beer_score)) %>%
 mutate(id = group_indices(., beer_category))
 
 ## Since I want each point colored with custom colors, I need to provide a matching vector of colors. 
 ##Generate pallete
colfunc <-colorRampPalette(c("#E9FF5C", "#FF8800", "#FF2B00"))
hc_colors <- sample(colfunc(nrow(milwaukees_favorite)))
```

So far, nothing special â€“ just your familiar dplyr chain.For anybody that hasnâ€™t used the fabulous highcharter package before, `add_series` is similar to a geom in ggplot2, `hcaes` are similar to `aes`, and you can add tooltips, and embed html to an extent. 

```
 highchart() %>% 
 hc_add_series(milwaukees_favorite, type = 'column', hcaes(x = id, y = avg), tooltip = list(pointFormat = "{point.beer_category}: {point.avg}"), showInLegend = F) %>%
 hc_add_series(milwaukees_favorite, type = 'bubble', hcaes(x = id, y = avg, size = total, group = beer_category), tooltip = list(pointFormat = "{point.beer_category}: {point.total}"), marker = list(fillOpacity=1), minSize = 20, maxSize = 80) %>%
 hc_plotOptions(column = list(pointWidth = .5, pointPlacement = "on")) %>%
 hc_title(text = "Milwaukee's Most Common Brewing Styles",
 useHTML = TRUE) %>%
 hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Avg Rating", style = list(color = "white", fontSize = 22)), labels = list(style = list(color = "white", fontSize = 15)), tickColor = "white", gridLineColor = "transparent") %>%
 hc_xAxis(labels = list(enabled = F), gridLineColor = "transparent") %>%
 hc_colors(color = hc_colors) %>%
 hc_chart(divBackgroundImage = 'https://i.ibb.co/S0hr0Vd/milwaukee.png',
 borderColor = 'white',
 borderRadius = 10,
 borderWidth = 2,
 backgroundColor = 'transparent') %>%
 hc_legend(backgroundColor = "#0D0D0D99", itemStyle = list(color = "#C9C9C9"), itemHoverStyle = list(color = "yellow"))
```




Of course, this is a teaser example to lure you to see my dashboard. Go there and explore the unique world of Milwaukee beer (in a marketing style dashboard) already!

The depth and complexity of the data were not too deep, but demonstrating visualization and tracking were my primary goals. While Iâ€™ve previously made a Shiny app that uses Halo 5â€™s API (yes, the game), dash-boarding has become an important skill which I felt necessary to add to my project list. **If anybody in the greater Milwaukee area** knows about a **job relating to R, SQL, data mining, or viz**, please leave me a message or add me on linked in! Contact info is hosted on this site as well as my apps.
