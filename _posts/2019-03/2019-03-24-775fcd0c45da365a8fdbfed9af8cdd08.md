“Within 10 years, data science will be so enmeshed within industry-specific applications and broad productivity tools that we may no longer think of it is a hot career. Just as generations of math and statistics students have gone on to fill all manner of roles in business and academia without thinking of themselves as mathematicians or statisticians, the newly minted data scientist grads will be tomorrow’s manufacturing engineers, marketing leaders and medical researchers.” Nate Oostendorp ( Mar 1, 2019 )
