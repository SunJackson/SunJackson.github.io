Below are links to my slides from my talk on *Future: Friendly Parallel Processing in R for Everyone* that I presented last month at the satRday Paris 2019 conference in Paris, France (February 23, 2019).

My talk (32 slides; ~40 minutes):

- Title: *Future: Friendly Parallel Processing in R for Everyone*

- HTML (incremental slides; requires online access)

- PDF (flat slides)


A big shout out to the organizers, all the volunteers, and everyone else for making it a great satRday.
