A recent post over at r-bar.net demonstrated how to use a Windows system utility to achieve a *super* Dark Rstudio theme.

Super Dark Theme

Well if you liked that post , but are on Linux or OSX or use RStudio Server, then we have a cross platform solution for you!

Rstudio is a web browser, which means it has an index.html page and we can use javascript to change it. And that’s what we’ll do. You’ll need to locate the `index.htm` file for Rstudio. I did this on linux with `locate rstudio | grep www/index.htm`.

You’ll also need a copy of `jquery.min.js`. Use your favorite method of file downloading to first place the contents of that jquery link into a the `www/js` folder, in a file called `jquery.min.js`. 

Next, copy the following code somewhere between the opening and closing html `body` tags:

When you next open RStudio, press `Ctrl+Shift+I` and Rstudio will invert colors. If you use a light theme, RStudio will switch to the so-called “Super Dark Theme”.
