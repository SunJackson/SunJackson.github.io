**Bayesian semi-parametric G-computation for causal inference in a cohort study with non-ignorable dropout and death**

Causal inference with observational longitudinal data and time-varying exposures is often complicated by time-dependent confounding and attrition. G-computation is one method used for estimating a causal effect when time-varying confounding is present. The parametric modeling approach typically used in practice relies on strong modeling assumptions for valid inference, and moreover depends on an assumption of missing at random, which is not appropriate when the missingness is non-ignorable or due to death. In this work we develop a flexible Bayesian semi-parametric G-computation approach for assessing the causal effect on the subpopulation that would survive irrespective of exposure, in a setting with non-ignorable dropout. The approach is to specify models for the observed data using Bayesian additive regression trees, and then use assumptions with embedded sensitivity parameters to identify and estimate the causal effect. The proposed approach is motivated by a longitudinal cohort study on cognition, health, and aging, and we apply our approach to study the effect of becoming a widow on memory.

**Dynamic Deep Multi-modal Fusion for Image Privacy Prediction**

With millions of images that are shared online on social networking sites, effective methods for image privacy prediction are highly needed. In this paper, we propose an approach for fusing object, scene context, and image tags modalities derived from convolutional neural networks for accurately predicting the privacy of images shared online. Specifically, our approach identifies the set of most competent modalities on the fly, according to each new target image whose privacy has to be predicted. The approach considers three stages to predict the privacy of a target image, wherein we first identify the neighborhood images that are visually similar and/or have similar sensitive content as the target image. Then, we estimate the competence of the modalities based on the neighborhood images. Finally, we fuse the decisions of the most competent modalities and predict the privacy label for the target image. Experimental results show that our approach predicts the sensitive (or private) content more accurately than the models trained on individual modalities (object, scene, and tags) and prior privacy prediction works. Also, our approach outperforms strong baselines, that train meta-classifiers to obtain an optimal combination of modalities.

**Lipschitz Adaptivity with Multiple Learning Rates in Online Learning**

We aim to design adaptive online learning algorithms that take advantage of any special structure that might be present in the learning task at hand, with as little manual tuning by the user as possible. A fundamental obstacle that comes up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate a so-called step-size or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient norms, etc. A recent technique promises to overcome this difficulty by maintaining multiple learning rates in parallel. This technique has been applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for online convex optimization and the Squint algorithm for prediction with expert advice. However, in both cases the user still has to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter that bounds the norm of the gradients. Although this hyperparameter is typically not available in advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set too small, the methods may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by designing new versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value automatically. We achieve this by dynamically updating the set of active learning rates. For MetaGrad, we further improve the computational efficiency of handling constraints on the domain of prediction, and we remove the need to specify the number of rounds in advance.

**Learning Everywhere: Pervasive Machine Learning for Effective High-Performance Computation**

The convergence of HPC and data-intensive methodologies provide a promising approach to major performance improvements. This paper provides a general description of the interaction between traditional HPC and ML approaches and motivates the Learning Everywhere paradigm for HPC. We introduce the concept of effective performance that one can achieve by combining learning methodologies with simulation-based approaches, and distinguish between traditional performance as measured by benchmark scores. To support the promise of integrating HPC and learning methods, this paper examines specific examples and opportunities across a series of domains. It concludes with a series of open computer science and cyberinfrastructure questions and challenges that the Learning Everywhere paradigm presents.

**An evolutionary model that satisfies detailed balance**

We propose a class of evolutionary models that involves an arbitrary exchangeable process as the breeding process and different selection schemes. In those models, a new genome is born according to the breeding process, and then a genome is removed according to the selection scheme that involves fitness. Thus the population size remains constant. The process evolves according to a Markov chain, and, unlike in many other existing models, the stationary distribution — so called mutation-selection equilibrium — can be easily found and studied. The behaviour of the stationary distribution when the population size increases is our main object of interest. Several phase-transition theorems are proved.

**The Block-wise Circumcentered-Reflection Method**

The elementary Euclidean concept of circumcenter has recently been employed to improve two aspects of the classical Douglas–Rachford method for projecting onto the intersection of affine subspaces. The so-called circumcentered-reflection method is able to both accelerate the average reflection scheme by the Douglas–Rachford method and cope with the intersection of more than two affine subspaces. We now introduce the technique of circumcentering in blocks, which, more than just an option over the basic algorithm of circumcenters, turns out to be an elegant manner of generalizing the method of alternating projections. Linear convergence for this novel block-wise circumcenter framework is derived and illustrated numerically. Furthermore, we prove that the original circumcentered-reflection method essentially finds the best approximation solution in one single step if the given affine subspaces are hyperplanes.

**Financial series prediction using Attention LSTM**

Financial time series prediction, especially with machine learning techniques, is an extensive field of study. In recent times, deep learning methods (especially time series analysis) have performed outstandingly for various industrial problems, with better prediction than machine learning methods. Moreover, many researchers have used deep learning methods to predict financial time series with various models in recent years. In this paper, we will compare various deep learning models, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), stacked long short-term memory (stacked LSTM), attention networks, and weighted attention networks for financial time series prediction. In particular, attention LSTM is not only used for prediction, but also for visualizing intermediate outputs to analyze the reason of prediction; therefore, we will show an example for understanding the model prediction intuitively with attention vectors. In addition, we focus on time and factors, which lead to an easy understanding of why certain trends are predicted when accessing a given time series table. We also modify the loss functions of the attention models with weighted categorical cross entropy; our proposed model produces a 0.76 hit ratio, which is superior to those of other methods for predicting the trends of the KOSPI 200.

**Towards Robust ResNet: A Small Step but A Giant Leap**

This paper presents a simple yet principled approach to boosting the robustness of the residual network (ResNet) that is motivated by the dynamical system perspective. Namely, a deep neural network can be interpreted using a partial differential equation, which naturally inspires us to characterize ResNet by an explicit Euler method. Our analytical studies reveal that the step factor h in the Euler method is able to control the robustness of ResNet in both its training and generalization. Specifically, we prove that a small step factor h can benefit the training robustness for back-propagation; from the view of forward-propagation, a small h can aid in the robustness of the model generalization. A comprehensive empirical evaluation on both vision CIFAR-10 and text AG-NEWS datasets confirms that a small h aids both the training and generalization robustness.

**PixelSteganalysis: Pixel-wise Hidden Information Removal with Low Visual Degradation**

It is difficult to detect and remove secret images that are hidden in natural images using deep-learning algorithms. Our technique is the first work to effectively disable covert communications and transactions that use deep-learning steganography. We address the problem by exploiting sophisticated pixel distributions and edge areas of images using a deep neural network. Based on the given information, we adaptively remove secret information at the pixel level. We also introduce a new quantitative metric called destruction rate since the decoding method of deep-learning steganography is approximate (lossy), which is different from conventional steganography. We evaluate our technique using three public benchmarks in comparison with conventional steganalysis methods and show that the decoding rate improves by 10 ~ 20%.

**BERT for Joint Intent Classification and Slot Filling**

Intent classification and slot filling are two essential tasks for natural language understanding. They often suffer from small-scale human-labeled training data, resulting in poor generalization capability, especially for rare words. Recently a new language representation model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), facilitates pre-training deep bidirectional representations on large-scale unlabeled corpora, and has created state-of-the-art models for a wide variety of natural language processing tasks after simple fine-tuning. However, there has not been much effort on exploring BERT for natural language understanding. In this work, we propose a joint intent classification and slot filling model based on BERT. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves significant improvement on intent classification accuracy, slot filling F1, and sentence-level semantic frame accuracy on several public benchmark datasets, compared to the attention-based recurrent neural network models and slot-gated models.

**A survey of hidden convex optimization**

Motivated by the fact that not all nonconvex optimization problems are difficult to solve, we survey in this paper three widely-used ways to reveal the hidden convex structure for different classes of nonconvex optimization problems. Finally, ten open problems are raised.

**A comparative evaluation of novelty detection algorithms for discrete sequences**

The identification of anomalies in temporal data is a core component of numerous research areas such as intrusion detection, fault prevention, genomics and fraud detection. This article provides an experimental comparison of the novelty detection problem applied to discrete sequences. The objective of this study is to identify which state-of-the-art methods are efficient and appropriate candidates for a given use case. These recommendations rely on extensive novelty detection experiments based on a variety of public datasets in addition to novel industrial datasets. We also perform thorough scalability and memory usage tests resulting in new supplementary insights of the methods’ performance, key selection criterion to solve problems relying on large volumes of data and to meet the expectations of applications subject to strict response time constraints.

**Context-aware Dynamic Block**

Although deeper and larger neural networks have achieved better performance nowadays, the complex network structure and increasing computational cost cannot meet the demands of many resource-constrained applications. An effective way to address this problem is to make use of dynamic inference mechanism. Existing methods usually choose to execute or skip an entire specific layer through a switch structure, which can only alter the depth of the network. In this paper, we propose a dynamic inference method called Context-aware Dynamic Block (CDB), which provides more path selection choices in terms of network width and depth during inference. The execution of CDB is determined by a context-aware group controller, which can take into account both historical and object category information. The proposed method can be easily incorporated into most modern network architectures. Experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 demonstrate the superiority of our method on both efficiency and overall classification quality. To be specific, we integrate CDB block into ResNet-101 and find that our method significantly outperforms their counterparts and saves 45.1% FLOPs.

**Better, Faster, Stronger Sequence Tagging Constituent Parsers**

Sequence tagging models for constituent parsing are faster, but less accurate than other types of parsers. In this work, we address the following weaknesses of such constituent parsers: (a) high error rates around closing brackets of long constituents, (b) large label sets, leading to sparsity, and (c) error propagation arising from greedy decoding. To effectively close brackets, we train a model that learns to switch between tagging schemes. To reduce sparsity, we decompose the label set and use multi-task learning to jointly learn to predict sublabels. Finally, we mitigate issues from greedy decoding through auxiliary losses and sentence-level fine-tuning with policy gradient. Combining these techniques, we clearly surpass the performance of sequence tagging constituent parsers on the English and Chinese Penn Treebanks, and reduce their parsing time even further. On the SPMRL datasets, we observe even greater improvements across the board, including a new state of the art on Basque, Hebrew, Polish and Swedish.

**Granger Causality Testing in High-Dimensional VARs: a Post-Double-Selection Procedure**

In this paper we develop an LM test for Granger causality in high-dimensional VAR models based on penalized least squares estimations. To obtain a test which retains the appropriate size after the variable selection done by the lasso, we propose a post-double-selection procedure to partial out the effects of the variables not of interest. We conduct an extensive set of Monte-Carlo simulations to compare different ways to set up the test procedure and choose the tuning parameter. The test performs well under different data generating processes, even when the underlying model is not very sparse. Additionally, we investigate two empirical applications: the money-income causality relation using a large macroeconomic dataset and networks of realized volatilities of a set of 49 stocks. In both applications we find evidences that the causal relationship becomes much clearer if a high-dimensional VAR is considered compared to a standard low-dimensional one.

**Fast Concurrent Data Sketches**

Data sketches are approximate succinct summaries of long streams. They are widely used for processing massive amounts of data and answering statistical queries about it in real-time. Existing libraries producing sketches are very fast, but do not allow parallelism for creating sketches using multiple threads or querying them while they are being built. We present a generic approach to parallelising data sketches efficiently, while bounding the error that such parallelism introduces. Utilising relaxed semantics and the notion of strong linearisability we prove our algorithm’s correctness and analyse the error it induces in two specific sketches. Our implementation achieves high scalability while keeping the error small.

**Towards Understanding Adversarial Examples Systematically: Exploring Data Size, Task and Model Factors**

Most previous works usually explained adversarial examples from several specific perspectives, lacking relatively integral comprehension about this problem. In this paper, we present a systematic study on adversarial examples from three aspects: the amount of training data, task-dependent and model-specific factors. Particularly, we show that adversarial generalization (i.e. test accuracy on adversarial examples) for standard training requires more data than standard generalization (i.e. test accuracy on clean examples); and uncover the global relationship between generalization and robustness with respect to the data size especially when data is augmented by generative models. This reveals the trade-off correlation between standard generalization and robustness in limited training data regime and their consistency when data size is large enough. Furthermore, we explore how different task-dependent and model-specific factors influence the vulnerability of deep neural networks by extensive empirical analysis. Relevant recommendations on defense against adversarial attacks are provided as well. Our results outline a potential path towards the luminous and systematic understanding of adversarial examples.

**SAFE ML: Surrogate Assisted Feature Extraction for Model Learning**

Complex black-box predictive models may have high accuracy, but opacity causes problems like lack of trust, lack of stability, sensitivity to concept drift. On the other hand, interpretable models require more work related to feature engineering, which is very time consuming. Can we train interpretable and accurate models, without timeless feature engineering? In this article, we show a method that uses elastic black-boxes as surrogate models to create a simpler, less opaque, yet still accurate and interpretable glass-box models. New models are created on newly engineered features extracted/learned with the help of a surrogate model. We show applications of this method for model level explanations and possible extensions for instance level explanations. We also present an example implementation in Python and benchmark this method on a number of tabular data sets.

**Multi-Stage Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Convolutional Networks**

Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) play a crucial role in graph learning tasks, however, learning graph embedding with few supervised signals is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for Graph Convolutional Network, called Multi-Stage Self-Supervised(M3S) Training Algorithm, combined with self-supervised learning approach, focusing on improving the generalization performance of GCNs on graphs with few labeled nodes. Firstly, a Multi-Stage Training Framework is provided as the basis of M3S training method. Then we leverage DeepCluster technique, a popular form of self-supervised learning, and design corresponding aligning mechanism on the embedding space to refine the Multi-Stage Training Framework, resulting in M3S Training Algorithm. Finally, extensive experimental results verify the superior performance of our algorithm on graphs with few labeled nodes under different label rates compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

**Link Prediction with Mutual Attention for Text-Attributed Networks**

In this extended abstract, we present an algorithm that learns a similarity measure between documents from the network topology of a structured corpus. We leverage the Scaled Dot-Product Attention, a recently proposed attention mechanism, to design a mutual attention mechanism between pairs of documents. To train its parameters, we use the network links as supervision. We provide preliminary experiment results with a citation dataset on two prediction tasks, demonstrating the capacity of our model to learn a meaningful textual similarity.

**AFS: An Attention-based mechanism for Supervised Feature Selection**

As an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its effectiveness to prepare high-dimensional data for many machine learning tasks. The proliferation of high di-mension and huge volume big data, however, has brought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on noisy data, upon existing feature-selection techniques. This paper introduces a novel neural network-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based Feature Selection (AFS). AFS consists of two detachable modules: an at-tention module for feature weight generation and a learning module for the problem modeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features and supervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a shallow attention net for each feature. Feature weights are generated based on the distribution of respective feature se-lection patterns adjusted by backpropagation during the train-ing process. The detachable structure allows existing off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less training time, demands for the training data and requirements for expertise. A hybrid initialization method is also intro-duced to boost the selection accuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generation. Experimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in comparison to several state-of-art feature selection algo-rithms upon both MNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets with small samples.

**Citation Needed: A Taxonomy and Algorithmic Assessment of Wikipedia’s Verifiability**

Wikipedia is playing an increasingly central role on the web,and the policies its contributors follow when sourcing and fact-checking content affect million of readers. Among these core guiding principles, verifiability policies have a particularly important role. Verifiability requires that information included in a Wikipedia article be corroborated against reliable secondary sources. Because of the manual labor needed to curate and fact-check Wikipedia at scale, however, its contents do not always evenly comply with these policies. Citations (i.e. reference to external sources) may not conform to verifiability requirements or may be missing altogether, potentially weakening the reliability of specific topic areas of the free encyclopedia. In this paper, we aim to provide an empirical characterization of the reasons why and how Wikipedia cites external sources to comply with its own verifiability guidelines. First, we construct a taxonomy of reasons why inline citations are required by collecting labeled data from editors of multiple Wikipedia language editions. We then collect a large-scale crowdsourced dataset of Wikipedia sentences annotated with categories derived from this taxonomy. Finally, we design and evaluate algorithmic models to determine if a statement requires a citation, and to predict the citation reason based on our taxonomy. We evaluate the robustness of such models across different classes of Wikipedia articles of varying quality, as well as on an additional dataset of claims annotated for fact-checking purposes.

**One-Shot Federated Learning**

We present one-shot federated learning, where a central server learns a global model over a network of federated devices in a single round of communication. Our approach – drawing on ensemble learning and knowledge aggregation – achieves an average relative gain of 51.5% in AUC over local baselines and comes within 90.1% of the (unattainable) global ideal. We discuss these methods and identify several promising directions of future work.

**Active Exploration in Markov Decision Processes**

We introduce the active exploration problem in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Each state of the MDP is characterized by a random value and the learner should gather samples to estimate the mean value of each state as accurately as possible. Similarly to active exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB), states may have different levels of noise, so that the higher the noise, the more samples are needed. As the noise level is initially unknown, we need to trade off the exploration of the environment to estimate the noise and the exploitation of these estimates to compute a policy maximizing the accuracy of the mean predictions. We introduce a novel learning algorithm to solve this problem showing that active exploration in MDPs may be significantly more difficult than in MAB. We also derive a heuristic procedure to mitigate the negative effect of slowly mixing policies. Finally, we validate our findings on simple numerical simulations.

**Unifying computational entropies via Kullback-Leibler divergence**

We introduce KL-hardness, a new notion of hardness for search problems which on the one hand is satisfied by all one-way functions and on the other hand implies both next-block pseudoentropy and inaccessible-entropy, two forms of computational entropy used in recent constructions of pseudorandom generators and statistically hiding commitment schemes, respectively. Thus, KL-hardness unifies the latter two notions of computational entropy and sheds light on the apparent ‘duality’ between them. Additionally, it yields a more modular and illuminating proof that one-way functions imply next-block inaccessible entropy, similar in structure to the proof that one-way functions imply next-block pseudoentropy (Vadhan and Zheng, STOC ’12).

**The principles of adaptation in organisms and machines I: machine learning, information theory, and thermodynamics**

How do organisms recognize their environment by acquiring knowledge about the world, and what actions do they take based on this knowledge? This article examines hypotheses about organisms’ adaptation to the environment from machine learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of organisms to the environment.

**Incorporating End-to-End Speech Recognition Models for Sentiment Analysis**

Previous work on emotion recognition demonstrated a synergistic effect of combining several modalities such as auditory, visual, and transcribed text to estimate the affective state of a speaker. Among these, the linguistic modality is crucial for the evaluation of an expressed emotion. However, manually transcribed spoken text cannot be given as input to a system practically. We argue that using ground-truth transcriptions during training and evaluation phases leads to a significant discrepancy in performance compared to real-world conditions, as the spoken text has to be recognized on the fly and can contain speech recognition mistakes. In this paper, we propose a method of integrating an automatic speech recognition (ASR) output with a character-level recurrent neural network for sentiment recognition. In addition, we conduct several experiments investigating sentiment recognition for human-robot interaction in a noise-realistic scenario which is challenging for the ASR systems. We quantify the improvement compared to using only the acoustic modality in sentiment recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity (MOSI) by achieving 73,6% accuracy in a binary sentiment classification task, exceeding previously reported results that use only acoustic input. In addition, we set a new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset (80.4% accuracy, 2% absolute improvement).

**NOODL: Provable Online Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding**

We consider the dictionary learning problem, where the aim is to model the given data as a linear combination of a few columns of a matrix known as a dictionary, where the sparse weights forming the linear combination are known as coefficients. Since the dictionary and coefficients, parameterizing the linear model are unknown, the corresponding optimization is inherently non-convex. This was a major challenge until recently, when provable algorithms for dictionary learning were proposed. Yet, these provide guarantees only on the recovery of the dictionary, without explicit recovery guarantees on the coefficients. Moreover, any estimation error in the dictionary adversely impacts the ability to successfully localize and estimate the coefficients. This potentially limits the utility of existing provable dictionary learning methods in applications where coefficient recovery is of interest. To this end, we develop NOODL: a simple Neurally plausible alternating Optimization-based Online Dictionary Learning algorithm, which recovers both the dictionary and coefficients exactly at a geometric rate, when initialized appropriately. Our algorithm, NOODL, is also scalable and amenable for large scale distributed implementations in neural architectures, by which we mean that it only involves simple linear and non-linear operations. Finally, we corroborate these theoretical results via experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm with the current state-of-the-art techniques.

**CircConv: A Structured Convolution with Low Complexity**

Deep neural networks (DNNs), especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have emerged as the powerful technique in various machine learning applications. However, the large model sizes of DNNs yield high demands on computation resource and weight storage, thereby limiting the practical deployment of DNNs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes to impose the circulant structure to the construction of convolutional layers, and hence leads to circulant convolutional layers (CircConvs) and circulant CNNs. The circulant structure and models can be either trained from scratch or re-trained from a pre-trained non-circulant model, thereby making it very flexible for different training environments. Through extensive experiments, such strong structure-imposing approach is proved to be able to substantially reduce the number of parameters of convolutional layers and enable significant saving of computational cost by using fast multiplication of the circulant tensor.

**Efficient Contextual Representation Learning Without Softmax Layer**

Contextual representation models have achieved great success in improving various downstream tasks. However, these language-model-based encoders are difficult to train due to the large parameter sizes and high computational complexity. By carefully examining the training procedure, we find that the softmax layer (the output layer) causes significant inefficiency due to the large vocabulary size. Therefore, we redesign the learning objective and propose an efficient framework for training contextual representation models. Specifically, the proposed approach bypasses the softmax layer by performing language modeling with dimension reduction, and allows the models to leverage pre-trained word embeddings. Our framework reduces the time spent on the output layer to a negligible level, eliminates almost all the trainable parameters of the softmax layer and performs language modeling without truncating the vocabulary. When applied to ELMo, our method achieves a 4 times speedup and eliminates 80% trainable parameters while achieving competitive performance on downstream tasks.

**A CNN-RNN Framework with a Novel Patch-Based Multi-Attention Mechanism for Multi-Label Image Classification in Remote Sensing**

This paper presents a novel framework that jointly exploits Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the context of multi-label remote sensing (RS) image classification. The proposed framework consists of four main modules. The first module aims to extract preliminary local descriptors by considering that RS image bands can be associated with different spatial resolutions. To this end, we introduce a K-Branch CNN in which each branch aims at extracting descriptors of image bands that have the same spatial resolution. The second module aims to model spatial relationship among local descriptors. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional RNN architecture in which Long Short-Term Memory nodes enrich local descriptors by considering spatial relationships of local areas (image patches). The third module aims to define multiple attention scores for local descriptors. To this end, we introduce a novel patch-based multi-attention mechanism that takes into account the joint occurrence of multiple land-cover classes and provides the attention-based local descriptors. The last module aims to employ these descriptors for multi-label RS image classification. Experimental results obtained on our large-scale Sentinel-2 benchmark archive (called as BigEarthNet) show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to a state of the art method.
