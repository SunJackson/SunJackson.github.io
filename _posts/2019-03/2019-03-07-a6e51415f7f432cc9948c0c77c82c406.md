A new version of R package gower has just been released on CRAN.

Thanks to our new contributor David Turner who was kind enough to provide a pull request, `gower` now also computes weighted gower distances.

From the NEWS file:

- gower_dist and gower_topn gain `weight` argument for weighted matching (thanks to David Turner)

- gower_dist and gower_topn gain `ignore_case` argument for automatic column matching.

- gower_dist now returns numeric(0) invisibly when there are no columns to compare.

- gower_topn now returns a list with empty matrices when there are no columns to compare.

- gower_topn now warns when n>nrow(y) and sets n=nrow(y)

- bugfix: comparing factors with characters would cause a crash (thanks to max Kuhn)


Compute Gower’s distance (or similarity) coefficient between records. Compute the top-n matches between records. Core algorithms are executed in parallel on systems supporting OpenMP.
