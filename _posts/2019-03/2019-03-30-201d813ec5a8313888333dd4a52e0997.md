“I’m confident to say that if you starting a new strategic enterprise application you should no longer be assuming that your persistence should be relational. … One of the interesting consequences of this is that we are gearing up for a shift to polyglot persistence where any decent sized enterprise will have a variety of different data storage technologies for different kinds of data.” Martin Fowler ( 2011 )
