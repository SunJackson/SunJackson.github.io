This paper discusses technology challenges and opportunities to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) era in the design of wireless networks. We aim to provide readers with motivation and general methodology for adoption of AI in the context of next-generation networks. First, we discuss the rise of network intelligence and then, we introduce a brief overview of AI with machine learning (ML) and their relationship to self-organization designs. Finally, we discuss design of intelligent agent and it’s functions to enable knowledge-driven wireless networks with AI.
