Hi everyone!

Springtime is coming and so is a new R Meetup, do you feel it in the air?

A MilanoR meetup is the ideal occasion to bring together R users in the Milano area to share knowledge and experiences, a free event, open to everybody.

**What we’ll talk about**

What’s the real value of a data product? Is it meant to just return an output or it can give us insights, suggestions, a vision? How can we make better data products?

On this meeting we will sail away on a journey, the path that leads every data professionals from raw data to meaningful and beautiful data products!

**Program**

– Welcome presentations

– *“From numbers to stories”* – Pietro Spagnolo

Data can help us write such different kind of stories, deeper stories to discover something new and lighter stories to show us something we’d never thought of. As professionals, we need to guide users, easing any complexity they might encounter.

– *“Share your R development: the example of SmaRP, Smart Retirement Planning”* – Francesca Vitalini

Smart Retirement Planning (SmaRP) is an initiative of Mirai Solutions designed to guide people working in Switzerland towards a strategic decision-making process for their retirement. Using SmaRP as an example, we will highlight how to structure a web app in R, how to extend the R Shiny framework for a nicer graphic interface, and how to generate a report through the app.

– *Some cool networking time*
