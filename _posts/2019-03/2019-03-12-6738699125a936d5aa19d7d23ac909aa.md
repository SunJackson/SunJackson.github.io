**The Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Adaptive eLearning System (AES) Content Formation: Risks and Opportunities involved**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays varying roles in supporting both existing and emerging technologies. In the area of Learning and Tutoring, it plays key role in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The fusion of ITS with Adaptive Hypermedia and Multimedia (AHAM) form the backbone of Adaptive eLearning Systems (AES) which provides personalized experiences to learners. This experience is important because it facilitates the accurate delivery of the learning modules in specific to the learner capacity and readiness. AES types vary, with Adaptive Web Based eLearning Systems (AWBES) being the popular type because of wider access offered by the web technology.The retrieval and aggregation of contents for any eLearning system is critical whichis determined by the relevance of learning material to the needs of the learner.In this paper, we discuss components of AES, role of AI in AES content aggregation, possible risks and available opportunities.

**Hacking Google reCAPTCHA v3 using Reinforcement Learning**

We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodology to bypass Google reCAPTCHA v3. We formulate the problem as a grid world where the agent learns how to move the mouse and click on the reCAPTCHA button to receive a high score. We study the performance of the agent when we vary the cell size of the grid world and show that the performance drops when the agent takes big steps toward the goal. Finally, we used a divide and conquer strategy to defeat the reCAPTCHA system for any grid resolution. Our proposed method achieves a success rate of 97.4% on a 100×100 grid and 96.7% on a 1000×1000 screen resolution.

**CodeNet: Training Large Scale Neural Networks in Presence of Soft-Errors**

This work proposes the first strategy to make distributed training of neural networks resilient to computing errors, a problem that has remained unsolved despite being first posed in 1956 by von Neumann. He also speculated that the efficiency and reliability of the human brain is obtained by allowing for low power but error-prone components with redundancy for error-resilience. It is surprising that this problem remains open, even as massive artificial neural networks are being trained on increasingly low-cost and unreliable processing units. Our coding-theory-inspired strategy, ‘CodeNet,’ solves this problem by addressing three challenges in the science of reliable computing: (i) Providing the first strategy for error-resilient neural network training by encoding each layer separately; (ii) Keeping the overheads of coding (encoding/error-detection/decoding) low by obviating the need to re-encode the updated parameter matrices after each iteration from scratch. (iii) Providing a completely decentralized implementation with no central node (which is a single point of failure), allowing all primary computational steps to be error-prone. We theoretically demonstrate that CodeNet has higher error tolerance than replication, which we leverage to speed up computation time. Simultaneously, CodeNet requires lower redundancy than replication, and equal computational and communication costs in scaling sense. We first demonstrate the benefits of CodeNet in reducing expected computation time over replication when accounting for checkpointing. Our experiments show that CodeNet achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff compared to both replication and uncoded strategies. CodeNet is a significant step towards biologically plausible neural network training, that could hold the key to orders of magnitude efficiency improvements.

**NoRML: No-Reward Meta Learning**

Efficiently adapting to new environments and changes in dynamics is critical for agents to successfully operate in the real world. Reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches typically rely on external reward feedback for adaptation. However, in many scenarios this reward signal might not be readily available for the target task, or the difference between the environments can be implicit and only observable from the dynamics. To this end, we introduce a method that allows for self-adaptation of learned policies: No-Reward Meta Learning (NoRML). NoRML extends Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) for RL and uses observable dynamics of the environment instead of an explicit reward function in MAML’s finetune step. Our method has a more expressive update step than MAML, while maintaining MAML’s gradient based foundation. Additionally, in order to allow more targeted exploration, we implement an extension to MAML that effectively disconnects the meta-policy parameters from the fine-tuned policies’ parameters. We first study our method on a number of synthetic control problems and then validate our method on common benchmark environments, showing that NoRML outperforms MAML when the dynamics change between tasks.

**From Knowledge Map to Mind Map: Artificial Imagination**

Imagination is one of the most important factors which makes an artistic painting unique and impressive. With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, more and more researchers try to create painting with AI technology automatically. However, lacking of imagination is still a main problem for AI painting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to inject rich imagination into a special painting art Mind Map creation. We firstly consider lexical and phonological similarities of seed word, then learn and inherit original painting style of the author, and finally apply Dadaism and impossibility of improvisation principles into painting process. We also design several metrics for imagination evaluation. Experimental results show that our proposed method can increase imagination of painting and also improve its overall quality.

**Zero-Shot Task Transfer**

In this work, we present a novel meta-learning algorithm, i.e. TTNet (Task Transfer Net), that regresses model parameters for novel tasks for which no ground truth is available (zero-shot tasks). In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, our meta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with ground truth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuition finds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adapt to a novel-concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts (hand movement or self-motion), without receiving explicit supervision. We evaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot: surface-normal, room layout, depth, and camera pose estimation. These tasks were chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexity associated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposed methodology out-performs state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth)on each of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer. We also conducted extensive experiments to study the various choices of our methodology, as well as showed how the proposed method can also be used in transfer learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstsuch effort on zero-shot learning in the task space.

**On the Long-term Impact of Algorithmic Decision Policies: Effort Unfairness and Feature Segregation through Social Learning**

Most existing notions of algorithmic fairness are one-shot: they ensure some form of allocative equality at the time of decision making, but do not account for the adverse impact of the algorithmic decisions today on the long-term welfare and prosperity of certain segments of the population. We take a broader perspective on algorithmic fairness. We propose an effort-based measure of fairness and present a data-driven framework for characterizing the long-term impact of algorithmic policies on reshaping the underlying population. Motivated by the psychological literature on social learning and the economic literature on equality of opportunity, we propose a micro-scale model of how individuals respond to decision making algorithms. We employ existing measures of segregation from sociology and economics to quantify the resulting macro-scale population-level change. Importantly, we observe that different models may shift the group-conditional distribution of qualifications in different directions. Our findings raise a number of important questions regarding the formalization of fairness for decision-making models.

**Towards Structured Evaluation of Deep Neural Network Supervisors**

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have improved the quality of several non-safety related products in the past years. However, before DNNs should be deployed to safety-critical applications, their robustness needs to be systematically analyzed. A common challenge for DNNs occurs when input is dissimilar to the training set, which might lead to high confidence predictions despite proper knowledge of the input. Several previous studies have proposed to complement DNNs with a supervisor that detects when inputs are outside the scope of the network. Most of these supervisors, however, are developed and tested for a selected scenario using a specific performance metric. In this work, we emphasize the need to assess and compare the performance of supervisors in a structured way. We present a framework constituted by four datasets organized in six test cases combined with seven evaluation metrics. The test cases provide varying complexity and include data from publicly available sources as well as a novel dataset consisting of images from simulated driving scenarios. The latter we plan to make publicly available. Our framework can be used to support DNN supervisor evaluation, which in turn could be used to motive development, validation, and deployment of DNNs in safety-critical applications.

**Using Causal Analysis to Learn Specifications from Task Demonstrations**

Learning models of user behaviour is an important problem that is broadly applicable across many application domains requiring human-robot interaction. In this work we show that it is possible to learn a generative model for distinct user behavioral types, extracted from human demonstrations, by enforcing clustering of preferred task solutions within the latent space. We use this model to differentiate between user types and to find cases with overlapping solutions. Moreover, we can alter an initially guessed solution to satisfy the preferences that constitute a particular user type by backpropagating through the learned differentiable model. An advantage of structuring generative models in this way is that it allows us to extract causal relationships between symbols that might form part of the user’s specification of the task, as manifested in the demonstrations. We show that the proposed method is capable of correctly distinguishing between three user types, who differ in degrees of cautiousness in their motion, while performing the task of moving objects with a kinesthetically driven robot in a tabletop environment. Our method successfully identifies the correct type, within the specified time, in 99% [97.8 – 99.8] of the cases, which outperforms an IRL baseline. We also show that our proposed method correctly changes a default trajectory to one satisfying a particular user specification even with unseen objects. The resulting trajectory is shown to be directly implementable on a PR2 humanoid robot completing the same task.

**Time-Dependent Surveillance-Evasion Games**

Surveillance-Evasion (SE) games form an important class of adversarial trajectory-planning problems. We consider time-dependent SE games, in which an Evader is trying to reach its target while minimizing the cumulative exposure to a moving enemy Observer. That Observer is simultaneously aiming to maximize the same exposure by choosing how often to use each of its predefined patrol trajectories. Following the framework introduced in Gilles and Vladimirsky (arXiv:1812.10620), we develop efficient algorithms for finding Nash Equilibrium policies for both players by blending techniques from semi-infinite game theory, convex optimization, and multi-objective dynamic programming on continuous planning spaces. We illustrate our method on several examples with Observers using omnidirectional and angle-restricted sensors on a domain with occluding obstacles.

**Opportunistic View Materialization with Deep Reinforcement Learning**

Carefully selected materialized views can greatly improve the performance of OLAP workloads. We study using deep reinforcement learning to learn adaptive view materialization and eviction policies. Our insight is that such selection policies can be effectively trained with an asynchronous RL algorithm, that runs paired counter-factual experiments during system idle times to evaluate the incremental value of persisting certain views. Such a strategy obviates the need for accurate cardinality estimation or hand-designed scoring heuristics. We focus on inner-join views and modeling effects in a main-memory, OLAP system. Our research prototype system, called DQM, is implemented in SparkSQL and we experiment on several workloads including the Join Order Benchmark and the TPC-DS workload. Results suggest that: (1) DQM can outperform heuristic when their assumptions are not satisfied by the workload or there are temporal effects like period maintenance, (2) even with the cost of learning, DQM is more adaptive to changes in the workload, and (3) DQM is broadly applicable to different workloads and skews.

**α-Rank: Multi-Agent Evaluation by Evolution**

We introduce {\alpha}-Rank, a principled evolutionary dynamics methodology, for the evaluation and ranking of agents in large-scale multi-agent interactions, grounded in a novel dynamical game-theoretic solution concept called Markov-Conley chains (MCCs). The approach leverages continuous-time and discrete-time evolutionary dynamical systems applied to empirical games, and scales tractably in the number of agents, in the type of interactions (beyond dyadic), and the type of empirical games (symmetric and asymmetric). Current models are fundamentally limited in one or more of these dimensions, and are not guaranteed to converge to the desired game-theoretic solution concept (typically the Nash equilibrium). {\alpha}-Rank automatically provides a ranking over the set of agents under evaluation and provides insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and long-term dynamics in terms of basins of attraction and sink components. This is a direct consequence of our new model’s direct correspondence to the dynamical MCC solution concept when its ranking-intensity parameter, {\alpha}, is chosen to be large, which exactly forms the basis of {\alpha}-Rank. In contrast to the Nash equilibrium, which is a static solution concept based solely on fixed points, MCCs are a dynamical solution concept based on the Markov chain formalism, Conley’s Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems, and the core ingredients of dynamical systems: fixed points, recurrent sets, periodic orbits, and limit cycles. Our {\alpha}-Rank method runs in polynomial time with respect to the total number of pure strategy profiles, whereas computing a Nash equilibrium for a general-sum game is known to be intractable. We introduce mathematical proofs that reveal the formal underpinnings of the {\alpha}-Rank methodology. We illustrate the method in canonical games and in AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuJoCo Soccer, and Poker.
