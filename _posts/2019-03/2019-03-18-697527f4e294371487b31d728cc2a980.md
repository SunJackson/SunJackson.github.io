The fine folks over at @PacketTotal bequeathed an API token on me so I cranked out an R package for it to enable more dynamic investigations work (RStudio makes for an amazing incident responder investigations console given that you can script in multiple languages, code in C[++], and write documentation all at the same time using R ‘projects’ with full source code control).

Since I used the `DT` package my usual “just copy and paste the markdown into WordPress” wasn’t going to work and I wasn’t going to do two `saveWidget()`s and force two iframes on y’all just for an introductory post, so the inline-iframe for the R markdown output is below and can be frame-busted as well.

You can also find the source for the R code used in the R markdown document here.
