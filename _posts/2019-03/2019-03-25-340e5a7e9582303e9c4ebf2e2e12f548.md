As of `cdata` version `1.0.8` `cdata` implements an operator notation for data transform.

The idea is simple, yet powerful.



First let’s start with some data.

```
d <- wrapr::build_frame(
 "id", "measure", "value" |
 1 , "AUC" , 0.7 |
 1 , "R2" , 0.4 |
 2 , "AUC" , 0.8 |
 2 , "R2" , 0.5 )

knitr::kable(d)
```

|------
|1|AUC|0.7|
|1|R2|0.4|
|2|AUC|0.8|
|2|R2|0.5|

In the above data we have two measurements each for two individuals (individuals identified by the "`id`" column). Using `cdata`‘s `new_record_spec()` method we can capture a description of this record structure.

```
library("cdata")

record_spec <- new_record_spec(
 wrapr::build_frame(
 "measure", "value" |
 "AUC" , "AUC" |
 "R2" , "R2" ),
 recordKeys = "id")

print(record_spec)
```

```
## $controlTable
## measure value
## 1 AUC AUC
## 2 R2 R2
## 
## $recordKeys
## [1] "id"
## 
## $controlTableKeys
## [1] "measure"
## 
## attr(,"class")
## [1] "cdata_record_spec"
```

Once we have this specification we can transform the data using operator notation.

We can collect the record blocks into rows by a "division" (or aggregation/projection) step.

|------
|1|AUC|0.7|
|1|R2|0.4|
|2|AUC|0.8|
|2|R2|0.5|

```
d2 <- d %//% record_spec

knitr::kable(d2)
```

|------
|1|0.7|0.4|
|2|0.8|0.5|

We can expand record rows into blocks by a "multiplication" (or join) step.

|------
|1|0.7|0.4|
|2|0.8|0.5|

```
d3 <- d2 %**% record_spec

knitr::kable(d3)
```

|------
|1|AUC|0.7|
|1|R2|0.4|
|2|AUC|0.8|
|2|R2|0.5|

And that is truly fluid data manipulation.
