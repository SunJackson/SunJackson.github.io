I received many messages regarding my book promotion (see previous post ). I’ll use this post to answer the most frequent questions:

 

*Does the paperback edition have a discount?*

No. The price drop is only valid for the **ebook edition** but not by choice. Unfortunately, Amazon does not let me do *countdown promotions* for the **paperback edition**.

So, in favor of those, like myself, that like the smell of a fresh book page, I manually dropped the price of the paperback to 17.99 USD (it was 24.99 USD). Printings costs are heavy, which is why I can’t go all the way to a 50% discount. The system tells me that the new price should be live within the next 72 hours. I’ll keep the new price until the end of this week.

 

*When will the second edition be released?*

My schedule is to start to work on the new edition of *Processing and Analyzing..* on june 2019. Hopefully I can publish it before january 2020. Sorry but I can’t give much detail about the new content yet. But be sure I’ll keep you guys posted.

 

Best.
