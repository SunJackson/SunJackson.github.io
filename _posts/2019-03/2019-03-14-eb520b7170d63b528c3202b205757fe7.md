Today is the Pi Day – an annual celebration of the mathematical constant Pi. It is observed every year on March 14, since Pi can be approximated by 3.14, and the this date is written as 3/14 in the month/day format.

To celebrate this day, here is a short quiz about Pi. You can find all the answers on the web, but it is more fun to try answering while depending only on personal knowledge. Let’s go!

1) In the ancient world, many cultures derived approximations to ?. Which ancient culture had the best approximation?a. Egyptb. Babylonc. Hebrewsd. India

2) Which of these fractions is the best approximation Pi?a. 2549491779/811528438b. 22/7c. 3927/1250d. 864/275

3) Who popularized the use of the Greek letter Pi to represent the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter?a. Carl Friedrich Gaussb. Leonard Eulerc. Pierre Simon Laplaced. Issac Newton

4) The problem of squaring the circle does not have a solution because Pi isa. An algebraic numberb. A rational numberc. A transcendental numberd. An irrational number

5) Who prove that the problem of squaring the circle does not have a solution?a. Carl Friedrich Gaussb. Adrien Marie Legendrec. Ferdinand von Lindmand. Evariste Galois

6) Pi plays an important role in Statistics becausea. The value of Pi can be approximated by dropping needles on the floorb. The sample size calculation formula contains Pic. The probability density function of the Normal distribution contains Pid. Pi is the maximal value of Euler’s population density curve

7) Who was born on Pi day?a. Johann Straussb. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartc. Johann Sebastian Bachd. Georges Bizet

8) How many decimal digits of Pi were calculated up to date?a. ~ 206 billionb. ~ 50 quintillionc. ~ 22.5 trilliond. ~ 352 million

9) The first known rigorous algorithm for calculating the value of Pi was devised bya. Shankara Variyarb. Liu Huic. Archimedesd. Ibn al-Haytham

10) Which of the following series does not converge to Pi?
