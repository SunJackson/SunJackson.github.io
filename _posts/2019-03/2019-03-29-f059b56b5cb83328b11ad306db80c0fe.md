A new version of drat just arrived on CRAN. And like the last time in December 2017 it went through as an automatically processed upgrade directly from the CRAN prechecks. Being a simple package can have its upsides…

And like the last time, this release once again draws largely upon contributed pull requests. Neal Fultz cleaned up how Windows paths are handled when inserting Windows (binary) packages. And Christoph Stepper extended the support for binary packages the helper commands `pruneRepo` and `archivePackages`. I added a minor cleanup to a test Neal added in the previous version, and that made a quick and simple release!

drat stands for *drat R Archive Template*, and helps with easy-to-create and easy-to-use *repositories* for R packages. Since its inception in early 2015 it has found reasonably widespread adoption among R users *because repositories with marked releases is the better way* to distribute code.

As your mother told you: *Friends don’t let friends install random git commit snapshots.* Rolled-up release it is. And despite what some (who may not know it well) say, `drat` is actually rather easy to use, documented by five vignettes and *just works*.

The `NEWS` file summarises the release as follows:
