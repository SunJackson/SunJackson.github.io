“We’ve all heard about Big Data, and for most of us, the concept of taming big data is overwhelming. In the average business enterprise, data is everywhere – hidden in spreadsheets, report writers, databases, ERP, CRM, SCM and other large systems as well as in legacy systems and small packages designed for accounting or other targeted departmental activities. The first order of business in taming big data is to pull all of that data together. Once the business has cataloged and compiled its data, it faces an even bigger task, namely, how to tame that data and make it accessible, clear and concise so that every user can leverage the data to effectively contribute to the business bottom line.” Shambhavi Vyas ( March 3, 2015 )
