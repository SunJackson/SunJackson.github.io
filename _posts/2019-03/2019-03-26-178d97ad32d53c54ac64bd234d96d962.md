**Manifold Adversarial Training (MAT)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The recently proposed adversarial training methods show the robustness to both adversarial and original examples and achieve state-of-the-art results in supervised and semi-supervised learning. All the existing adversarial training methods consider only how the worst perturbed examples (i.e., adversarial examples) could affect the model output. Despite their success, we argue that such setting may be in lack of generalization, since the output space (or label space) is apparently less informative. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Manifold Adversarial Training (MAT). MAT manages to build an adversarial framework based on how the worst perturbation could affect the distributional manifold rather than the output space. Particularly, a latent data space with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) will be first derived. On one hand, MAT tries to perturb the input samples in the way that would rough the distributional manifold the worst. On the other hand, the deep learning model is trained trying to promote in the latent space the manifold smoothness, measured by the variation of Gaussian mixtures (given the local perturbation around the data point). Importantly, since the latent space is more informative than the output space, the proposed MAT can learn better a robust and compact data representation, leading to further performance improvement. The proposed MAT is important in that it can be considered as a superset of one recently-proposed discriminative feature learning approach called center loss. We conducted a series of experiments in both supervised and semi-supervised learning on three benchmark data sets, showing that the proposed MAT can achieve remarkable performance, much better than those of the state-of-the-art adversarial approaches. … 

**RMSProp+AF** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Source localization is of pivotal importance in several areas such as wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT), where the location information can be used for a variety of purposes, e.g. surveillance, monitoring, tracking, etc. Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) is one of the well-known localization approaches where the source broadcasts a signal and a number of receivers record the arriving time of the transmitted signal. By means of computing the time difference from various receivers, the source location can be estimated. On the other hand, in the recent few years novel optimization algorithms have appeared in the literature for $(i)$ processing big data and for $(ii)$ training deep neural networks. Most of these techniques are enhanced variants of the classical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) but with additional features that promote faster convergence. In this paper, we compare the performance of the classical SGD with the novel techniques mentioned above. In addition, we propose an optimization procedure called RMSProp+AF, which is based on RMSProp algorithm but with the advantage of incorporating adaptation of the decaying factor. We show through simulations that all of these techniques—which are commonly used in the machine learning domain—can also be successfully applied to signal processing problems and are capable of attaining improved convergence and stability. Finally, it is also shown through simulations that the proposed method can outperform other competing approaches as both its convergence and stability are superior. … 

**Cross-Domain Latent Feature Mapping (CDLFM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted technique in recommender systems. Traditional CF models mainly focus on predicting a user’s preference to the items in a single domain such as the movie domain or the music domain. A major challenge for such models is the data sparsity problem, and especially, CF cannot make accurate predictions for the cold-start users who have no ratings at all. Although Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) is proposed for effectively transferring users’ rating preference across different domains, it is still difficult for existing CDCF models to tackle the cold-start users in the target domain due to the extreme data sparsity. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Domain Latent Feature Mapping (CDLFM) model for cold-start users in the target domain. Firstly, in order to better characterize users in sparse domains, we take the users’ similarity relationship on rating behaviors into consideration and propose the Matrix Factorization by incorporating User Similarities (MFUS) in which three similarity measures are proposed. Next, to perform knowledge transfer across domains, we propose a neighborhood based gradient boosting trees method to learn the cross-domain user latent feature mapping function. For each cold-start user, we learn his/her feature mapping function based on the latent feature pairs of those linked users who have similar rating behaviors with the cold-start user in the auxiliary domain. And the preference of the cold-start user in the target domain can be predicted based on the mapping function and his/her latent features in the auxiliary domain. Experimental results on two real data sets extracted from Amazon transaction data demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model against other state-of-the-art methods. …
