The technology industry has seen a major shift recently—mostly towards cloud computing. Defined as a web-based computing model, cloud computing allows users to share information with other devices and computers instantly. This can allow multiple people to access the same files and data with minimal effort, and can also give users the option to easily store large amounts of data.

These days, many businesses take advantage of the convenience offered through cloud platforms. Some of the top cloud computing platforms that are widely used include Microsoft Azure and AWS. If you’re looking to work in an exciting new career and learn more about cloud computing, getting a Microsoft Azure certification can be an important first step.

This type of certification not only offers flexibility in the type of role you work in, but also the industry you work in as well.

Certified Azure professionals find themselves working all around the world, including the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, India, France, Italy, and so on.

**Structured learning approach**

When it comes to online learning, there are a lot of options. Some people choose to watch tutorial videos or read blogs, but they don’t receive that structured learning approach by using various online resources. It can get confusing, and it can be easy to misunderstand important information—or even miss out on it entirely.

By enrolling in an accredited course, you learn everything you need to know to master Microsoft Azure, and receive expert help and instruction along the way.

**Learn how theoretical concepts can be used to solve business problems**

Books, university courses, and tutorial videos all teach a lot about theoretical concepts. But only an accredited education program, such as Simplilearn's, will also include industry experts demonstrating how to use those concepts to solve real-life business problems. Additionally, students enrolled in a structured education program have the opportunity to practice what they’re learning with projects and integrated labs.

 

**Stay updated on the latest trends in the industry**

When you enroll in an accredited online learning program, you’re learning all the newest information, and you’re kept up-to-date on the latest trends. The key to expanding your knowledge base and skill set is learning something new on a daily basis. If you’re juggling multiple responsibilities, such as a family and full-time job, learning these things from various sources is usually too time-consuming. Enrolling in a structured learning program is the easiest way to ensure you’re learning everything you should be.

**Demonstrate your knowledge**

Earning a Microsoft Azure certification is an impressive credential, and shows potential employers that are you are skilled in Microsoft Azure. It’s a great addition to your resume and can help you stand out amongst other candidates who may have similar work experience, but don’t have the professional training. Employers tend to favor applicants who clearly took the time and effort to further their training by becoming certified, and your certification is concrete proof that you are highly knowledgeable when it comes to Microsoft Azure.

 

**Prove that you’re committed**

It’s not easy earning a professional certification. Unlike self-learning from various online sources, taking the time to enroll in a course, study for an exam, and become certified takes a whole different level of commitment. It shows that you’re willing to put time and money into furthering your education in an industry you’re passionate about. It can be especially difficult (yet as equally impressive to others) if you’re juggling other commitments at the same time. It only shows that you’re dedicated to furthering your career by receiving adequate training. This is another trait that potential employers admire, and how it can help you stand out in a good way.

 

**Interact with like-minded individuals**

By enrolling in an accredited online learning program, you can be assured that you’re learning from industry experts. You also get the opportunity to network and interact with your classmates, who share the same interests and goals as you, which can allow you to build lasting professional relationships.
