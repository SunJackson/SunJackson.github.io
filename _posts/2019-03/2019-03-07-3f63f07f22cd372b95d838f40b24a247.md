This is why we’re all here, right? The new and shiny! Let’s get going; the listis pretty long.

### The Shape of Geoms

Many of the new and current geoms and stats in ggforce are really there to allowyou to draw different types of shapes easily. This means that the workhorse ofthese has been `geom_polygon()`, while ggforce provided the means to describethe shapes in meaningful ways (e.g. wedges, circles, thick arcs). With the newrelease all of these geoms (as well as the new ones) will use the new`geom_shape()` under the hood. The shape geom is an extension of the polygon onethat allows a bit more flourish in how the final shape is presented. It doesthis by providing two additional parameters: `expand` and `radius`, which willallow fixed unit expansion (and contraction) of the polygons as well as roundingof the corners based on a fixed unit radius. What do I mean with *fixed unit*?In the same way as the points in `geom_point` stay the same size during resizingof the plot, so does the corner radius and expansion of the polygon.

Let us modify the `goem_polygon()` example to use `geom_shape()` to see what itis all about:

```
library(ggforce)

ids <- factor(c("1.1", "2.1", "1.2", "2.2", "1.3", "2.3"))
values <- data.frame(
 id = ids,
 value = c(3, 3.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 3.5)
)
positions <- data.frame(
 id = rep(ids, each = 4),
 x = c(2, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 1, 0, 0.3, 1.1, 2.2, 1.1, 1.2, 2.5, 1.1, 0.3,
 0.5, 1.2, 2.5, 1.2, 1.3, 2.7, 1.2, 0.5, 0.6, 1.3),
 y = c(-0.5, 0, 1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 2.1, 1.7, 1, 1.5,
 2.2, 2.1, 1.7, 2.1, 3.2, 2.8, 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 3.2)
)
datapoly <- merge(values, positions, by = c("id"))

# Standard look
ggplot(datapoly, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
 geom_polygon(aes(fill = value, group = id))
```

```
# Contracted and rounded
ggplot(datapoly, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
 geom_shape(aes(fill = value, group = id), 
 expand = unit(-2, 'mm'), radius = unit(5, 'mm'))
```

If you’ve never needed this, it may be the kind of thing you go*why even bother*, but if you’ve needed to venture into Adobe Illustrator to addthis kind of flourish it is definitely something where you appreciate the lack ofthis round-trip. And remember: you can stick this at anything that expects a`geom_polygon` — not just the ones from ggforce.

### More shape primitives

While `geom_shape()` is the underlying engine for drawing, ggforce adds a bunchof new shape parameterisations, which we will quickly introduce:

`geom_ellipse` makes, you guessed it, ellipses. Apart from standard ellipses italso offers the possibility of making super-ellipses so if you’ve been dying todraw those with ggplot2, now is your time to shine.

```
# Not an ordinary ellipse — a super-ellipse
ggplot() +
 geom_ellipse(aes(x0 = 0, y0 = 0, a = 6, b = 3, angle = -pi / 3, m1 = 3)) +
 coord_fixed()
```

`geom_bspline_closed` allows you to draw closed b-splines. It takes the sametype of input as `geom_polygon` but calculates a closed b-spline from the cornerpoints instead of just connecting them.

```
# Create 6 random control points
controls <- data.frame(
 x = runif(6),
 y = runif(6)
)

ggplot(controls, aes(x, y)) +
 geom_polygon(fill = NA, colour = 'grey') +
 geom_point(colour = 'red') +
 geom_bspline_closed(alpha = 0.5)
```

`geom_regon` draws regular polygons of a set radius and number of sides.

```
ggplot() +
 geom_regon(aes(x0 = runif(8), y0 = runif(8), sides = sample(3:10, 8),
 angle = 0, r = runif(8) / 10)) +
 coord_fixed()
```

`geom_diagonal_wide` draws thick diagonals (quadratic bezier paths with the twocontrol points pointing towards each other but perpendicular to the same axis)

```
data <- data.frame(
 x = c(1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2),
 y = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5),
 group = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)
)

ggplot(data) +
 geom_diagonal_wide(aes(x, y, group = group))
```

### Is it a Sankey? Is it an Alluvial? No, It’s a Parallel Set

Speaking of diagonals, one of the prime uses of this is for creating parallelsets visualizations. There’s a fair bit of nomenclature confusion with this,so you may know this as Sankey diagrams, or perhaps alluvial plots. I’ll insistthat Sankey diagrams are specifically for following flows (and often employs amore loose positioning of the axes) and alluvial plots are for followingtemporal changes, but we can all be friends no matter what you call it. ggforceallows you to create parallel sets plots with a standard layered geom approach(for another approach to this problem, seethe ggalluvial package). The mainproblem is that data for parallel sets plots are usually not represented verywell in the tidy format expected by ggplot2, so ggforce further provides areshaping function to get the data in line for plotting:

```
titanic <- reshape2::melt(Titanic)
# This is how we usually envision data for parallel sets
head(titanic)
```

```
## Class Sex Age Survived value
## 1 1st Male Child No 0
## 2 2nd Male Child No 0
## 3 3rd Male Child No 35
## 4 Crew Male Child No 0
## 5 1st Female Child No 0
## 6 2nd Female Child No 0
```

```
# Reshape for putting the first 4 columns as axes in the plot
titanic <- gather_set_data(titanic, 1:4)
head(titanic)
```

```
## Class Sex Age Survived value id x y
## 1 1st Male Child No 0 1 Class 1st
## 2 2nd Male Child No 0 2 Class 2nd
## 3 3rd Male Child No 35 3 Class 3rd
## 4 Crew Male Child No 0 4 Class Crew
## 5 1st Female Child No 0 5 Class 1st
## 6 2nd Female Child No 0 6 Class 2nd
```

```
# Do the plotting
ggplot(titanic, aes(x, id = id, split = y, value = value)) +
 geom_parallel_sets(aes(fill = Sex), alpha = 0.3, axis.width = 0.1) +
 geom_parallel_sets_axes(axis.width = 0.1) +
 geom_parallel_sets_labels(colour = 'white')
```

As can be seen, the parallel sets plot consist of several layers, which issomething required for many, more involved, composite plot types. Separatingthem into multiple layers gives you more freedom without over-poluting theargument and aesthetic list.

### The markings of a great geom

If there is one thing of general utility lacking in ggplot2 it is probably theability to annotate data cleanly. Sure, there’s `geom_text()`/`geom_label()` butusing them requires a fair bit of fiddling to get the best placement andfurther, they are mainly relevant for labeling and not longer text. `ggrepel`has improved immensely on the fiddling part, but the lack of support for longertext annotation as well as annotating whole areas is still an issue.

In order to at least partly address this, ggforce includes a family of geomsunder the `geom_mark_*()` moniker. They all behaves equivalently except for howthey encircle the given area(s). The 4 different geoms are:

- `geom_mark_rect()` encloses the data in the smallest enclosing rectangle

- `geom_mark_circle()` encloses the data in the smallest enclosing circle

- `geom_mark_ellipse()` encloses the data in the smallest enclosing ellipse

- `geom_mark_hull()` encloses the data with a concave or convex hull


All the enclosures are calculated at draw time so respond to resizing (most aresusceptible to changing aspect ratios), and further uses `geom_shape()` with adefault expansion and radius set, so that the enclosure is always slightlylarger than the data it needs to enclose.

Just to give a quick sense of it, here’s an example of `geom_mark_ellipse()`

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
 geom_mark_ellipse(aes(fill = Species)) +
 geom_point()
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


If you simply want to show the area where different classes appear, we’re prettymuch done now, as the shapes along with the legend tells the story. But Ipromised you some more: textual annotation. So how does this fit into it all?

In addition to the standard aesthetics for shapes, the mark geoms also take a`label` and `description` aesthetic. When used, things get interesting:

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
 geom_mark_ellipse(aes(fill = Species, label = Species)) +
 geom_point()
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


The text is placed automatically so that it does not overlap with any data usedin the layer, and it responds once again to resizing, always trying to find themost optimal placement of the text. If it is not possible to place the desiredtext it elects to not show it at all.

Anyway, in the plot above we have an overabundance of annotation. Both thelegend and the labels. Further, we often want to add annotations to specificdata in the plot, not all of it. We can put focus on setosa by ignoring theother groups:

```
desc <- 'This iris species has a markedly smaller petal than the others.'
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
 geom_mark_ellipse(aes(filter = Species == 'setosa', label = 'Setosa', 
 description = desc)) +
 geom_point()
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


We are using another one of the mark geom family’s tricks here, which is thefilter aesthetic. It makes it quick to specify the data you want to annotate,but in addition the remaining data is remembered so that any annotation doesn’toverlap with it even if it is not getting annotated (you wouldn’t get this ifyou pre-filtered the data for the layer). Another thing that happens behind thelines is that the `description` text automatically gets word wrapping, based ona desired width of the text-box (defaults to 5 cm).

The mark geoms offer a wide range of possibilities for styling the annotation,too many to go into detail with here, but rest assured that you have fullcontrol over text appearance, background, line, distance between data andtext-box etc.

### Lost in Tessellation

The last of the big additions in this release is a range of geoms for creatingand plotting Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi tessellation. How often do youneed that, you ask? Maybe never… Does it look wicked cool? Why, yes!

Delaunay triangulation is a way to connect points to their nearest neighborswithout any connections overlapping. By nature, this results in triangles beingcreated. This data can either be thought of as a set of triangles, or a set ofline segments, and ggforce provides both through the `geom_delaunay_tile()` and`geom_delaunay_segment()` geoms. Further, a `geom_delaunay_segment2()` versionexists that mimics `geom_link2` in allowing aesthetic interpolation betweenendpoints.

As we are already quite acquainted with the Iris dataset, let’s take it for awhirl again:

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
 geom_delaunay_tile(alpha = 0.3) + 
 geom_delaunay_segment2(aes(colour = Species, group = -1), size = 2,
 lineend = 'round')
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


The triangulation is not calculated at draw time and is thus susceptible torange differences on the x and y axes. To combat this it is possible tonormalize the position data before calculating the triangulation.

Voronoi tessellation is sort of an inverse of Delaunay triangulation. it drawsperpendicular segments in the middle of all the triangulation segments andconnects the neighboring ones. The end result is a tile around each pointmarking the area where the point is the closest one. In parallel to thetriangulation, Voronoi also comes with both a tile and a segment version.

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
 geom_voronoi_tile(aes(fill = Species, group = -1L)) + 
 geom_voronoi_segment() +
 geom_point()
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


We need to set the `group` aesthetic to a scalar in order to force all points tobe part of the same tessellation. Otherwise each group would get its own:

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
 geom_voronoi_tile(aes(fill = Species), colour = 'black')
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)

Let’s quickly move on from that…

As a Voronoi tessellation can in theory expand forever, we need to define abounding box. The default is to expand an enclosing rectangle 10% to each side,but you can supply your own rectangle, or even an arbitrary polygon. Further,it is possible to set a radius bound for each point instead:

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
 geom_voronoi_tile(aes(fill = Species, group = -1L), max.radius = 0.2,
 colour = 'black')
```

![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


This functionality is only available for the tile geom, not the segment, butthis will hopefully change with a later release.

A last point, just to beat a dead horse, is that the tile geoms of courseinherits from `geom_shape()` so if you like them rounded corners you can have ityour way:

```
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) + 
 geom_voronoi_tile(aes(fill = Species, group = -1L), max.radius = 1,
 colour = 'black', expand = unit(-0.5, 'mm'), 
 radius = unit(0.5, 'mm'), show.legend = FALSE)
```

### Zoom

Not a completely new feature as the ones above, but `facet_zoom()` has gainedenough new power to warrant a mention. The gist of the facet is that it allowsyou to zoom in on an area of the plot while keeping the original view as aseparate panel. The old version only allowed specifying the zoom region byproviding a logical expression that indicated what data should be part of thezoom, but it now has a dedicated `xlim` and `ylim` arguments to set themdirectly.

```
ggplot(diamonds) + 
 geom_histogram(aes(x = price), bins = 50) + 
 facet_zoom(xlim = c(3000, 5000), ylim = c(0, 2500), horizontal = FALSE)
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


The example above shows a shortcoming in simply zooming in on a plot. Sometimesthe resolution (here, bins) aren’t really meaningful for zooming. Because ofthis, `facet_zoom()` has gotten a `zoom.data` argument to indicate what data toput on the zoom panel and what to put on the overview panel (and what to put inboth places). It takes a logical expression to evaluate on the data and if itreturns `TRUE` the data is put in the zoom panel, if it returns `FALSE` it isput on the overview panel, and if it returns `NA` it is put in both. To improvethe visualization above, well add two layers with different number of bins anduse `zoom.data` to put them in the right place:

```
ggplot() + 
 geom_histogram(aes(x = price), dplyr::mutate(diamonds, z = FALSE), bins = 50) + 
 geom_histogram(aes(x = price), dplyr::mutate(diamonds, z = TRUE), bins = 500) + 
 facet_zoom(xlim = c(3000, 5000), ylim = c(0, 300), zoom.data = z,
 horizontal = FALSE) + 
 theme(zoom.y = element_blank(), validate = FALSE)
```

![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/www.data-imaginist.com/post/2019-03-04-the-ggforce-awakens-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png?w=450&ssl=1)


The last flourish we did above was to remove the zoom indicator for the y axiszoom by using the `zoom.y` theme element. We currently need to turn offvalidation for this to work as ggplot2 by default doesn’t allow unknown themeelements.
