Metaprogrammation impact
Lately, R meta programmation seems to be in vogue. Very huge promises, encompassingcode to produce code, variable indirection naming schemes, and many others marvelousfeatures are now available through the **tidyverse**. Indeed, very huge promises,are generally the right sensor to enter into skepticism and to verify by our-selfit worth or not to switch from well-known and limited code approaches, to less-known morepromising and more modern code approaches

### A simple use case

To start small, I just used meta programmation for a very simple case, that isaccess to data embedded into a **data.table**, using various variable kind ofparameters.

Two main requirements are

1. parameter number is not known in advanced,

1. parameter might be given as **string** or **symbol**.


#### Implementation

##### First approach: rely solely on data.table capabilities, using strings

```
filter_by_string_builtin <- function(dt, ...) {
 dt[, ..., with = FALSE]
} 

```

Here, the limit is that you can not pass symbols in the call. You must use **strings**.

##### Second approach: rely solely on data.table capabilities, using symbols

```
filter_by_symbol_builtin <- function(dt, ...) {
 dt[, ...]
}

```

Here, the limit is that you can pass only symbols in the call. You must not use **strings**.

##### Third approach: use data.table capabilities and meta-programmation

```
filter_by_symbol <- function(dt, ...) {
 sy <- ensyms(...)
 ss <- sapply(sy, as_string)
 dt[, ss, with = FALSE]
}

```

Here you may use **strings** or **symbols**, or even mix them.

##### Fourth approach: use tidyverse

```
filter_by_quosure <- function(dt, ...) {
 sy <- enquos(...)
 #if (length(sy) == 0) return(dt)
 dt %>%
 select(!!!sy)
}

```

Here you may use **strings** or **symbols**, or even mix them.

#### Run it by hand

All of them provide right (from a functional point of view) and identical answer.OK, but what about performance ?

```
mm <- microbenchmark(filter_by_string_builtin(dt, 'x', 'r'),
 filter_by_symbol_builtin(dt, x, r),
 filter_by_symbol(dt, 'x', 'r'),
 filter_by_symbol(dt, x, r),
 filter_by_quosure(dt, 'x', 'r'),
 filter_by_quosure(dt, x, r),
 times = 1000
)

dz <- summary(mm)
dk <- as.data.table(tidyr::gather(dz, what, data, min:max))
dk[, `:=`(x = rep(1:6, 6), what = factor(what, levels = unique(dk$what), ordered = TRUE))]
g <- ggplot(dk, aes(x = what, y = data, group = expr, color = expr)) + 
 geom_line(size = 2) +
 ggtitle(paste0('Microbenchmark - 6 number timing (', dk[1]$neval, ' evaluations)')) + 
 theme(legend.position = 'top')

h <- ggplot(dk[what != 'max'], aes(x = what, y = data, group = expr, color = expr)) + 
 geom_line(size = 2) +
 ggtitle(paste0('Microbenchmark - 5 number timing (', dk[1]$neval, ' evaluations)')) + 
 theme(legend.position = 'top')

sf <- function(e) e / e[1]
dk[, `:=`(p = sf(data)), by = 'what']

p <- ggplot(dk[what != 'max'], aes(x = what, y = p, group = expr, color = expr)) + 
 geom_line(size = 2) +
 ggtitle(paste0('Microbenchmark - 5 number timing ratio (', dk[1]$neval, ' evaluations)')) + 
 ylab('ratio in comparison to best performing approach') + xlab('') + 
 theme(legend.position = 'top')

```

And performance data are

```

 expr min lq mean median uq max neval

```

### Conclusion

On this example, it is very clear that meta-programmation has a performance cost.Minimal cost ratio of using **symbols** instead of **strings** is above 1.6, in all casesI studied. Remarkably, *filter_by_symbol_builtin* performs worst than *filter_by_symbol*.Using **quosures** seems to bring a huge overhead as performance ratio exceeds 5. This implementation, although quite straight and simple, might not be optimal (your suggestions are welcome).

Knowing that implementation time of the various approaches requires quite different time and concentration efforts, we may really consider when is it worth to use meta-programmation.

As a rule of thumb, here is my empirical approach

1. stick to existing features, using **non standard evaluation** schemes provided as a standard. Reuse them as is. This applies to **data.table**, **ggplot2** packages and to other packages provinding such features.

1. prefer string arguments over symbol arguments wherever and whenever possible, as it simplifies inception and seems to drain better performance from current packages implementation.

1. restrain from using meta-programmation at a wide-scale. Keep it for clear and really useful use cases. Ease of maintenance and code volume reduction are wrong arguments here. R is based upon functions and functional programming, use it priorly to meta-programmation.


I had several tries in very different situations with meta-programming and I am still not fully convinced. Until now, I understand and feel the cost in inception and performance, but I do not perceive real value beyond promises. Some may argue about how easy is to handle data using **dplyr**. I would say not as easy as directly handling **data.table** (especially if you know this package well).Some would tell that **tidyverse** is the right way. It might. I like **ggplot2**, **tidyr**, **rmarkdown** and some other packages from it. I am fond of tidy data approach, but still remain suspicious about meta-programmation. My various real-life experience have not identified or proven any case yet, really in favor of meta-programmation. Just wondering if I haven’t miss a key about it ?
