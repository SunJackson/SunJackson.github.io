The presentations:

The rapid pace of research in Deep Reinforcement Learning has been driven by the presence of fast and challenging simulation environments. These environments often take the form of games; with tasks ranging from simple board games, to classic home console games, to modern strategy games. We propose a new benchmark called Obstacle Tower: a high visual fidelity, 3D, 3rd person, procedurally generated game environment. An agent in the Obstacle Tower must learn to solve both low-level control and high-level planning problems in tandem while learning from pixels and a sparse reward signal. Unlike other similar benchmarks such as the ALE, evaluation of agent performance in Obstacle Tower is based on an agent's ability to perform well on unseen instances of the environment.

Machine learning interpretability is becoming an integral part of the data scientist workflow and can no longer be an afterthought. This talk will explore the vibrant area of machine learning interpretability and explain how to understand black-box models. Thanks to an interpretability technique based on colitional game theory: SHAP.

When it comes to actually leverage AI in production and especially in an environment where it interacts with humans, auditability and trust are not optional. That's why Explainable AI becomes a new R&D space. This talks will show why and where explainability in AI is needed, what it actually means and compare some of the techniques that falls into this category.




> 
Impact AI is a think and Do tank that aims to deal with the ethical and societal challenges of AI. We develop an ethical framework for responsible use of Artificial Intelligence respecting principles easy to understand and apply at a large scale. This talk is about the Governance part of this tool box
