With four highly-specialised data analytics modules, and the practical business knowledge provided by the core MBA modules, NTU’s100% online course can prepare you for a career in big data.

**Harness the power of data storytelling**

One of the biggest challenges facing businesses is the ability to utilise complex data to clearly express an argument; data storytelling is a coveted skill in many business sectors.

The Statistical Approaches to Data Analysis module of the online course demonstrates how to present data for the purposes of data mining and predictive modelling. You’ll learn invaluable skills including how to visually present data in the most appropriate graphical layout in order to communicate its meaning to stakeholders and to predict expected outcomes based on statistical evidence.

**Understand the importance of data storage infrastructure**

Many businesses depend on a complex combination of information management systems, but with so much data in the workplace, how can businesses manage and store it effectively? There’s no one solution that will suit everyone, so companies must consider the best strategy based on their unique business needs.

Databases, data warehouses and cloud-based storage are all covered by the Fundamentals of Big Data and its Infrastructure module on the Online MBA with Data Analytics. Taking organisational set-up and intentions for data into consideration, you’ll be able to recommend sustainable data management methods. These can expose opportunities for work practice streamlining and cost-saving almost instantly, as well as evidence for refined strategic direction.

**Utilising the power of machine learning**

In addition to the increase in consciousness of big data, organisations are now able to access machine learning methods to perform elements of data analysis. Algorithms can be programmed to undertake analysis automatically, built on machine learning derived from huge data sets.

Automation is a powerful tool and the Online MBA with Data Analytics’ Practical Machine Learning Methods for Data Mining module will allow you to use machine learning models to categorise and group data, and use it to make valuable business forecasts. These skills are imperative for Data Scientists, Machine Learning Researchers and AI Software Developers.

**Understand big data’s impact on society**

The concept of big data is not just revolutionizing the business world but is also influencing and re-defining every area of society.Therefore, it’s crucial for those working with big data to understand its impact within numerous settings, such as nationally, internationally and in terms of ethics and legislation.

The Deriving Business Value from Data Science module of the online course will help you to understand the importance of using big data legally and responsibly, and how to gain the insight companies require within a best practice framework. This skill is valuable to all types of sectors, particularly in roles in Strategic Governance, Data Compliance and Data Quality.
