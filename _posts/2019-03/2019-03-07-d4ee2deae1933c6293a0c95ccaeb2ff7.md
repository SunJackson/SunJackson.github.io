On this day another R User Meetup was also happening up in Sapporo,Hokkaido. You can check them outhere. Althoughthis was the second Tokyo.R of 2019 I wasn’t able to attend the one inJanuary as I was at the RStudio::Conf in Austin, Texas… a long way fromhome! Similar to my roundup blogpostof the talks at Japan.R Iwill be going through around half of all the talks. Hopefully, myefforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to thewider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts andlinks from other sources if you are interested in learning more aboutthe topic of a certain talk. You can follow **Tokyo.R** by searching for the#TokyoR hashtag onTwitter.

Unlike most R Meetups a lot of people present using just their Twitterhandles so I’ll mostly be referring to them by those instead. I’ve beengoing to events here in Japan for about a year but even now sometimesI’m like, “Whoahh that’s what`@very_recognizable_twitter_handle_in_the_japan_r_community` actuallylooks like?!” Anyways…

Let’s get started!

Every **Tokyo.R** sessions starts off with three talks given by one of theorganizing team members who go over some of the very basic aspects of R forbeginner users. These talks are given by very experienced R users andare a way to let newbies feel comfortable before diving into real worldapplications of R in the main talks and LTs happening later on.

In this edition of Tokyo.R:


ktatyamtema gave a talk on Rbasics, from downloading and installing packages, reading in datafiles into R, and saving outputs from R.


Slides


Next, kilometer00 gave a talk ondata pipelines, specifically focusing on proper coding style andthought process behind good programming. He showed some really greatexamples, like in the picture below, of writing code that is easy tounderstand by using the `tidyverse` verbs and pipes. His entireslideshow has tons of great images on how to visualize programmingin R which you really don’t need Japanese to understand so Irecommend beginners to have a look through them!

Finally, koriakane gave a talk onplotting and visualizing data using both base R and `ggplot2`. Shecarefully explained step-by-step the process of creating differenttypes of graphs and working with colors and scales. At the end ofthe slides there is a huge list of `ggplot2` resources in Japanesethat would be very helpful to Japanese R users.

## kato_kohaku: Model-Agnostic Explanations

In the first main talk of the day, `@kato_kohaku` dived deep intomodel-agnostic explanations using the `DALEX`, `iml`, and `mlr`packages. One of the problems seen in the ML field is the growingcomplexity of models as researchers have been able to push the limits ofwhat they can do with increased computational power and the consequentdiscovery of new methods. The high performance of these complex modelshave come at a high cost with interpretability being reduceddramatically, with many of these newer models being called “black boxes”for that very reason. A model-agnostic method is preferable tomodel-specific methods mainly due to their flexibility, as typicallydata scientists evaluate many different types of ML models to solve atask. A model-agnostic method allows you to compare these types ofmodels using the same method in a way that a model-specific methodcan’t.

`@kato_kohaku` went over the workflow for performing model-agnosticinterpretation and covered partial dependence plots (PDP), individualconditional expectation (ICE), permutation importance, accumulated localeffects plot (ALE), feature interaction, LIME, Shapley values, and more.

The topics he covered are well explained in ChristophMolnar’s excellent book,Interpretable MachineLearning which`@kato_kohaku` referred to through the presentation. There are a HUGEamount of slides (146 of them!) filled with a ton of great info that youcan can read (a lot of the slides have explanations taken straight fromthe documentation in English) so I highly recommend taking a lookthrough them if you are interested in what the `DALEX` and `iml`packages have to offer for interpreting models.

A great code-through explanation of using `DALEX` with `mlr` in Englishcan be foundhereusing the same data set as seen in `@kato_kohaku's` slides.

## y_mattu: Operators/Objects in R

One of the organizers of Tokyo.R, `@y_mattu`, presented on objects in R.Specifically he went over using the `pryr` and `lobstr` packages to dig inside Robjects and see what is happening “under the hood” of your everyday Roperations.

> 
“Every object in R is a function, every function in R is an object”


The above maxim means that even operators such as `+` can be turned intoa function using parentheses to place all the arguments:

![](https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/HZY2g5V.jpg?w=450&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/HZY2g5V.jpg?w=450&ssl=1)


Looking deeper `@y_mattu` used the `ast()` function from the `lobstr`package to see the abstract syntax tree of the R expression that wasshown above, `1 + 2`.

```
library(lobstr)
lobstr::ast(1 + 2)

```

```
## o-`+` 
## +-1 
## \-2

```

The above shows the exact order in which the functions are being run byR. To now understand *what* is happening when we run this operation weneed to look at the R environment. To check which environment holds the`+ ()` operator

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'pryr'

## The following objects are masked from 'package:lobstr':
## 
## ast, mem_used

```

And we find that the `base` package holds this operator and it is calledfrom the `base` environment. In the final part `@y_mattu` looked intothe `+` operator itself by looking at the `.Primitive()` as well as`pryr::show_c_source()` to see the C source code used to make R be ableto run `+`.

This was a very technical topic (for me) but it piqued my interest onwhat’s actually happening whenever you run a line of R code!

At every Tokyo.R the hosting company is given time to talk about theirown company, how they use R, and hopefully provide some information forany interested job seekers. For DeNA,`@bob3bob3` gave this talk and he provided us on some details on whatexactly DeNA does as well as his own LT on SEM using `lavaan`. DeNA is aentertainment/e-commerce firm that is most well-known for it’s cellphoneplatform, `Mobage`. Interestingly, they also took ownership ofMyAnimeList a few years back (probably one ofthe largest anime/manga database communities in the world). For jobseekers he talked about the large variety of positions DeNA haveavailable in the “Kaggler” category as well as open positions in theautomobile, healthcare, sports analytics, HR analytics, marketingresearcher departments, and more…!

Following his elevator pitch about DeNA he gave a small talk about using`lavaan` to plot out path analysis for structural equation modeling.`@bob3bob3` explained how he ended up creating his own plotting functionusing the `DiagrammeR` and `Graphviz` packages to visualize the `lavaan`output as he did not like the default plotting method.

## flaty13: Tidy Time-Series Analysis

`@flaty13`, who has also recently presented atJapan.Rand SportsAnalystMeetupon tennis analytics, gave a talk on analyzing time-series data with R.He first talked about how packages like `lubridate` and `dplyr`, whileuseful, may not be the best way to handle time series data. The solution`@flaty13` talked about was the `tsibble` package created by EaroWang. At RStudio::Conf 2019 Earo gave atalk on this package and using tidy data principles with time seriesdata which you can watchhere.

`@flaty13` used his own pedometer data from a healthcare app on hisiPhone for his demonstration. After reading the data in and performingthe usual tidyverse operations on it, the data frame was turned into a`tsibble` object and then visualized as a calendar plot using the`sugrrants` package (also by Earo Wang).

## saltcooky: Organizing a R Study Group at My Company!

`@saltcooky` took the time to talk to us about something that doesn’tusually get mentioned at Tokyo.R, as he reported about the success of anintra-company R workshop he hosted. At `@saltcooky's` company themajority of his co-workers are *Pythonistas* with only three otherco-workers and him being R users. Hoping to change this dynamic,especially as their company does a lot of data analytics, `@saltcooky`set out to create some workshops. What he came up with were threeseparate sessions heavily inspired by the Tokyo.R method that I talkedabout in “Beginner Tutorial” section.

- The first session was basically around an hour on R basics andtalking about what exactly you can do with R, where he got the*Pythonistas* to slowly get interested in using R for variousanalytical tasks.

- Second, was a tidyverse data handling/processing session with somehands-on exercises with help from `@y_mattu`.

- The third session was using `ggplot2` for visualization.


Throughout the workshops `@saltcooky` was asked some peculiar questionslike “Is there a difference in using `.` vs. `_` in separating words ina function/object name?” and “Why are there so many packages/functionswith the same functionality!?”.

One of the major hurdles that `@saltcooky` faced was in installing R forall the different OSes that his co-workers used. The solution he came upwith was to use **RStudio Cloud**. This eased the burden for him as hedidn’t need to set up or manage any servers while the students did notneed to install any software at all! There was actually a great talk onusing “RStudio Cloud forEducation”by Mel Gregory at **RStudio::Conference 2019** a few months ago and it’sa great resource for others thinking about holding workshops.

`@saltcooky` concluded that his workshops were a mild success as he wasable to get a couple more people using R casually at his workplace andalthough Python remains dominant he looks forward to convincing morepeople to use R in the future.

## moratoriamuo271: Topic Modeling Cooking Recipes!

Continuing the theme of “tidy” data analysis, `@moratoriamuo271` appliedthe concept to text analysis. The motivation for this talk came from thedifficulty and hassle of figuring out a nice set of meals to eat overthe course of a week. To solve this problem he sought to create arecommendation engine for recipes!

![](https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Rf1sJkm.jpg?w=450&ssl=1)


As seen in the above flowchart `@moratoriamuo271`:

1. Web scraped recipes using `rvest`

1. Created some word-clouds for some EDA

1. Used the `RMeCab` and `tm` to create an organized document term matrix(`RMeCab` is a package specifically for Japanese text analysis)

1. Latent Dirichlet Analysis with `topicmodels` and `ldatuning` packages

1. Finally, splitting recipes into categories with `tidytext`


Before he showed us the results of his work, `@moratoriamuo271` took usthrough a crash course on various topic modeling techniques from thebasic uni-gram model, to mixture of uni-gram models, and finally onLatent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA).

He also went over the process in which he decided on the optimal numberof topics for his recommendation engine. This was done by looking at theperplexity values from the `ldatuning` package.Here is agreat blog post by Peter Ellis onusing cross-validation on perplexity to determine the optimal numberof topics. Below is the final finished product that gives you recipesfor nutritious and balanced meals for seven dinners!

`@moratoriamuo271` has also released a blog post with ALL the code thatyou can check outhere!

I couldn’t go through all of the talks but I will provide their slidesbelow (if/when they become available)

After the talks, everyone got together for a little after-party overfood and drinks. Usually pizza is served but this time was a bit morefancy with kara-age and cheese-on-crackers being served. As the nightwore on R users from all over Tokyo talked about their successes andstruggles with R.

Unfortunately, there is only so much I can do to translate the talks,especially as **Tokyo.R** doesn’t do recordings anymore, but I hope that Icould be of some help and maybe you’ll be inspired by a code snippetthere or a certain package name elsewhere, etc.! **Tokyo.R** happens almostmonthly and it’s a great way to mingle with Japanese R users as it isthe largest regular meetup here in Japan. Talks in English are alsowelcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
