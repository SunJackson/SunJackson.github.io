**Deep Neural Linear Bandit** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We study the neural-linear bandit model for solving sequential decision-making problems with high dimensional side information. Neural-linear bandits leverage the representation power of deep neural networks and combine it with efficient exploration mechanisms, designed for linear contextual bandits, on top of the last hidden layer. Since the representation is being optimized during learning, information regarding exploration with ‘old’ features is lost. Here, we propose the first limited memory neural-linear bandit that is resilient to this phenomenon, which we term catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our method on a variety of real-world data sets, including regression, classification, and sentiment analysis, and observe that our algorithm is resilient to catastrophic forgetting and achieves superior performance. … 

**Emotional Word Vector (EVEC)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
It is important for machines to interpret human emotions properly for better human-machine communications, as emotion is an essential part of human-to-human communications. One aspect of emotion is reflected in the language we use. How to represent emotions in texts is a challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Although continuous vector representations like word2vec have become the new norm for NLP problems, their limitations are that they do not take emotions into consideration and can unintentionally contain bias toward certain identities like different genders. This thesis focuses on improving existing representations in both word and sentence levels by explicitly taking emotions inside text and model bias into account in their training process. Our improved representations can help to build more robust machine learning models for affect-related text classification like sentiment/emotion analysis and abusive language detection. We first propose representations called emotional word vectors (EVEC), which is learned from a convolutional neural network model with an emotion-labeled corpus, which is constructed using hashtags. Secondly, we extend to learning sentence-level representations with a huge corpus of texts with the pseudo task of recognizing emojis. Our results show that, with the representations trained from millions of tweets with weakly supervised labels such as hashtags and emojis, we can solve sentiment/emotion analysis tasks more effectively. Lastly, as examples of model bias in representations of existing approaches, we explore a specific problem of automatic detection of abusive language. We address the issue of gender bias in various neural network models by conducting experiments to measure and reduce those biases in the representations in order to build more robust classification models. … 

**Waterfall Chart** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A waterfall chart is a form of data visualization that helps in understanding the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. The waterfall chart is also known as a flying bricks chart or Mario chart due to the apparent suspension of columns (bricks) in mid-air. Often in finance, it will be referred to as a bridge. Waterfall charts were popularized by the strategic consulting firm McKinsey & Company in its presentations to clients. The waterfall chart is normally used for understanding how an initial value is affected by a series of intermediate positive or negative values. Usually the initial and the final values are represented by whole columns, while the intermediate values are denoted by floating columns. The columns are color-coded for distinguishing between positive and negative values.➘ “Waterfall Chart”![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)
