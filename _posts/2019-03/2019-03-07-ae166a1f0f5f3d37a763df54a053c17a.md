Recently one of my coworkers showed me a ggplot and although it is not wrong, it is also not ideal. Here is the TL:DR :

Whenever you find yourself adding multiple geom_* to show different groups, reshape your data


In software engineering there are things called antipatterns, ways of programmingthat lead you into potential trouble. This is one of them.

I’m not saying it is incorrect, but it might lead you into trouble.

example: we have some data, some different calculations and we want to plot that.


**I load tidyverse and create a modified mtcars set in this hidden part,but if you don’t care you can leave it unopened** 


*Cool how this folds away right? It even works on github markdown, if you want to know how I did this, I explain it here*

```
library(tidyverse) # I started loading magrittr, ggplot2 and tidyr, and realised
```

```
## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──
```

```
## ✔ ggplot2 3.1.0 ✔ purrr 0.3.0
## ✔ tibble 2.0.1 ✔ dplyr 0.7.8
## ✔ tidyr 0.8.2 ✔ stringr 1.4.0
## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.3.0
```

```
## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()
```

```
# I needed dplyr too, at some point loading tidyverse is simply easiest.
very_serious_data <- 
 mtcars %>% 
 as_tibble(rownames = "carname") %>% 
 group_by(cyl) %>% 
 mutate(
 mpg_hp = mpg/hp,
 first_letter = str_extract(carname, "^[A-z]"),
 mpg_hp_c = mpg_hp/mean(mpg_hp),# grouped mean
 mpg_hp_am = mpg_hp+ am
 )
```

Now the data (mtcars) and calculations don’t really make sense but they are here to show you theantipattern. I created 3 variants of dividing mpg (miles per gallon) by hp (horse power)

### The antipattern

We have a dataset with multiple variables (columns) and want to plotone against the other, so far so good.

What is the effect of mpg_hp for every first letter of the cars?

```
very_serious_data %>% 
 ggplot(aes(first_letter, mpg_hp))+
 geom_point()+
 labs(caption = "So far so good")
```

But you might wonder what the other transformations of that variable do?You can just add a new geom_point, but maybe with a different color?And to see the dots that overlap you might make them a little opaque.

```
very_serious_data %>% 
 ggplot(aes(first_letter, mpg_hp))+
 geom_point(alpha = 2/3)+
 geom_point(aes(y = mpg_hp_c), color = "red", alpha = 2/3)+
 labs(caption = "adding equivalent information")
```

And maybe the third one too?

```
very_serious_data %>% 
 ggplot(aes(first_letter, mpg_hp))+
 geom_point(alpha = 2/3)+
 geom_point(aes(y = mpg_hp_c), color = "red", alpha = 2/3)+
 geom_point(aes(y = mpg_hp_am), color = "blue", alpha = 2/3)+
 labs(caption = "soo much duplication in every geom_point call!")
```

This results in lots of code duplication for specifying what is essentiallythe same for every `geom_point()` call. It’s also really hard to add a legendnow.

### What is the alternative?

>

Gather the columns that are essentially representing the group and reshapethe data into a format more suitable for plotting. Bonus: automatic correct labeling.

```
very_serious_data %>% 
 gather(key = "ratio", value = "score", mpg_hp, mpg_hp_c, mpg_hp_am ) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(first_letter, score, color = ratio))+
 geom_point(alpha = 2/3)+
 labs(caption = "fixing the antipattern")
```

And that’s it.
