Which US city has the worst weather? To answer that question, data analyst Taras Kaduk counted the number of pleasant days in each city and ranked them accordingly. For this analysis, a "pleasant" day is one where the average temperature was in the range 55°F-75°F, the maximum was in the range 60°-90°, the minimum was in the range 40°-70°, and there was no significant rain or snow. (The weather data was provided by the NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day dataset and downloaded to R with the rnoaa package.)

With those criteria and focusing just on the metro regions with more than 1 million people, the cities with the fewest pleasant days are:

1. San Juan / Carolina / Caguas, Puerto Rico (hot year-round)

1. Rochester, NY (cold in the winter, rain in the summer)

1. Detroit / Warren / Dearborn, MI (cold in the winter, rain in the summer)


You can see the top (bottom?) 25 cities in this list in the elegant chart below (also by Tara Kaduk), which shows each city as a polar bar chart and with one ring for each of the 6 years of data analyzed.

And if you're wondering which cities have the *best *weather, here's the corresponding chart for the 25 cities with the most pleasant days. San Diego / Carlsbad (CA) tops that list.

You can find the R code behind the analysis and charts in this Github repository. (The polar charts above required a surprisingly small amount of code: it's a simple transformation of a regular bar chart with the ggplot2 `coord_polar` transformation — quite appropriate given the annual cycle of weather data.) And for the full description of the analysis including some other nice graphical representations of the data, check out the blog post linked below.
