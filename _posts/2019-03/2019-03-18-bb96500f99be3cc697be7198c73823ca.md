**Job Qualifications**

Wake Forest University has a long tradition of excellence in market-relevant teaching, and the ideal candidate should demonstrate an ability to contribute to the teaching quality of the School of Business.  The School of Business focuses on educating the whole person, with our faculty members facilitating student acquisition of deep conceptual knowledge, their attainment of a broad set of professional competencies, and their development of a clear sense of professional identity and character.  Therefore, we seek a student-centric colleague who subscribes to this holistic educational philosophy, serves as an exemplary role model, and can demonstrate a commitment to teaching courses that develop students in all three of these areas.

Moreover, we also seek an educator who is dedicated to four central foci in the School of Business’ educational mission – that is, who have a track record of developing the following strengths in others:

Impactful – Our graduates are able to make immediate, meaningful contributions to their organizations through their ability to think strategically, act practically, and communicate effectively.
Professional – Our graduates create value for others; embrace a professional identity and understand and commit to stewardship of the honor, traditions, and productive and innovative culture of their professions; and work to strengthen their community using the skill and expertise of their professional training.
Honorable – To achieve high levels of performance while maintaining the highest standards of individual character, our graduates lead ethically and exhibit personal strengths that enable success with integrity.
Global – To effectively lead across cultural and geographical boundaries, our graduates leverage diversity and demonstrate a global mindset.

Because we are preparing students to succeed and flourish in the profession, we seek to hire colleagues who understand the marketplace, desire to be deeply connected to it on a continuing basis, and are committed to supporting our students as they prepare for and embark on fulfilling career trajectories.  Applicants with demonstrated ability to design and deliver educational experiences that are valued by industry will be preferred.
