**Smart System** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Smart systems incorporate functions of sensing, actuation, and control in order to describe and analyze a situation, and make decisions based on the available data in a predictive or adaptive manner, thereby performing smart actions. In most cases the ‘smartness’ of the system can be attributed to autonomous operation based on closed loop control, energy efficiency, and networking capabilities. … 

**Distributed Online Linear Regression** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We study online linear regression problems in a distributed setting, where the data is spread over a network. In each round, each network node proposes a linear predictor, with the objective of fitting the \emph{network-wide} data. It then updates its predictor for the next round according to the received local feedback and information received from neighboring nodes. The predictions made at a given node are assessed through the notion of regret, defined as the difference between their cumulative network-wide square errors and those of the best off-line network-wide linear predictor. Various scenarios are investigated, depending on the nature of the local feedback (full information or bandit feedback), on the set of available predictors (the decision set), and the way data is generated (by an oblivious or adaptive adversary). We propose simple and natural distributed regression algorithms, involving, at each node and in each round, a local gradient descent step and a communication and averaging step where nodes aim at aligning their predictors to those of their neighbors. We establish regret upper bounds typically in ${\cal O}(T^{3/4})$ when the decision set is unbounded and in ${\cal O}(\sqrt{T})$ in case of bounded decision set. … 

**Quantile Fourier Neural Network** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A novel quantile Fourier neural network is presented for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting. Prediction are provided in the form of composite quantiles using time as the only input to the model. This effectively is a form of extrapolation based quantile regression applied for forecasting. Empirical results showcase that for time series data that have clear seasonality and trend, the model provides high quality probabilistic predictions. This work introduces a new class of forecasting of using only time as the input versus using past data such as an autoregressive model. Extrapolation based regression has not been studied before for probabilistic forecasting. …
