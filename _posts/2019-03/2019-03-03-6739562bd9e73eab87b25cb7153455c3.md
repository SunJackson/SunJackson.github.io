**Highly Efficient Network (HENet)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In order to enhance the real-time performance of convolutional neural networks(CNNs), more and more researchers are focusing on improving the efficiency of CNN. Based on the analysis of some CNN architectures, such as ResNet, DenseNet, ShuffleNet and so on, we combined their advantages and proposed a very efficient model called Highly Efficient Networks(HENet). The new architecture uses an unusual way to combine group convolution and channel shuffle which was mentioned in ShuffleNet. Inspired by ResNet and DenseNet, we also proposed a new way to use element-wise addition and concatenation connection with each block. In order to make greater use of feature maps, pooling operations are removed from HENet. The experiments show that our model’s efficiency is more than 1 times higher than ShuffleNet on many open source datasets, such as CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN. … 

**Information-Theoretic Canonical Correlation Analysis (ITCCA)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a linear representation learning method that seeks maximally correlated variables in multi-view data. Non-linear CCA extends this notion to a broader family of transformations, which are more powerful for many real-world applications. Given the joint probability, the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) provides an optimal solution to the non-linear CCA problem. However, it suffers from limited performance and an increasing computational burden when only a finite number of observations is available. In this work we introduce an information-theoretic framework for the non-linear CCA problem (ITCCA), which extends the classical ACE approach. Our suggested framework seeks compressed representations of the data that allow a maximal level of correlation. This way we control the trade-off between the flexibility and the complexity of the representation. Our approach demonstrates favorable performance at a reduced computational burden, compared to non-linear alternatives, in a finite sample size regime. Further, ITCCA provides theoretical bounds and optimality conditions, as we establish fundamental connections to rate-distortion theory, the information bottleneck and remote source coding. In addition, it implies a ‘soft’ dimensionality reduction, as the compression level is measured (and governed) by the mutual information between the original noisy data and the signals that we extract. … 

**Sifaka** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Text mining and analytics software has become popular, but little attention has been paid to the software architectures of such systems. Often they are built from scratch using special-purpose software and data structures, which increases their cost and complexity. This demo paper describes Sifaka, a new open-source text mining application constructed above a standard search engine index using existing application programmer interface (API) calls. Indexing integrates popular annotation software libraries to augment the full-text index with noun phrase and named-entities; n-grams are also provided. Sifaka enables a person to quickly explore and analyze large text collections using search, frequency analysis, and co-occurrence analysis; and import existing document labels or interactively construct document sets that are positive or negative examples of new concepts, perform feature selection, and export feature vectors compatible with popular machine learning software. Sifaka demonstrates that search engines are good platforms for text mining applications while also making common IR text mining capabilities accessible to researchers in disciplines where programming skills are less common. …
