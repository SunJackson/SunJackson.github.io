Two items this week made me think of these posts. First was that a few days ago I noticed the following `src/Makefile` of the precrec package I was starting to use more:

```
# copied from https://github.com/vinecopulib/rvinecopulib
# strip debug symbols for smaller Linux binaries
strippedLib: $(SHLIB)
 if test -e "/usr/bin/strip" & test -e "/bin/uname" & [[ `uname` == "Linux" ]] ; \
 then /usr/bin/strip --strip-debug $(SHLIB); fi
.phony: strippedLib
```

And lo and behold, the quoted package rvinecopulib

has the same

```
CXX_STD = CXX11
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I../inst/include -pthread

# strip debug symbols for smaller Linux binaries
strippedLib: $(SHLIB)
 if test -e "/usr/bin/strip" & test -e "/bin/uname" & [[ `uname` == "Linux" ]] ; \
 then /usr/bin/strip --strip-debug $(SHLIB); fi
.phony: strippedLib
```

I was intrigued and googled a little. To my surprise I found one related reference … in a stone-old `src/Makevars` of mine in RcppClassic and probably written in 2007 or 2008. But more astonishing, the actual reference to the “phony target” trick is in … the #9 post from August 2017 referenced above. Doh. Younger me knew this, current me did not, and as those two packages didn’t reference my earlier use I had to re-find it. Oh well.

But the topic is still a very important one. The two blog posts show how to deal with this locally as a user and “consumer” of packages (as well as via the “phony trick” as a producer of packages) as well as an admin of a system with such packages. Personally I had been using this trick since August 2017 via my `~/.R/Makevars`.

And we were still missing such a tool for the more general deployment. Well, until today, or rather, until R 3.6.0 comes out offically on April 26. The (excellent) R-devel Daily ‘NEWS’ feed – which itself was the topic of post #3: Follow R-devel – will likely show tomorrow something about this commit I spotted by following Winston’s mirror of the R-devel sources:

And indeed, we now can now do this with `R-devel` (rebuilt from today’s sources):

As a quick check, installing the (small, C-only) digest package without / with the `--strip` options gets us, respectively, 425kb and 123kb. So the ratios from the chart above should now be achievable directly from `R CMD INSTALL --strip` with R 3.6.0. (And for what it is worth, it still works with the older tricks mentioned above.)

And as occupying disk space with unused debugging symbols is wasteful, the new extension to `R CMD INSTALL` is most welcome.

Last but not least: It is this type of relentless small improvements to R, its innards, its installations and support by R Core that make this system for *Programming with Data* such an excellent tool and joy to use and follow. A big *Thank You!* to R Core for all they do, and do quietly yet relentlessly. It is immensely appreciated.
