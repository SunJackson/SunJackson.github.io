We are happy to introduce the **vistributions** package, a set of tools forvisually exploring probability distributions.

## Installation

```
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("vistributions")

# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsquaredacademy/vistributions")
```

## Shiny App

**vistributions** includes a shiny app which can be launched using

```
vdist_launch_app()
```

or try the live version here.





Read on to learn more about the features of **vistributions**, or see thevistributions website fordetailed documentation on using the package.

## Tab Completion

The common `vdist_` prefix will trigger autocomplete, allowing you to see all**vistributions** functions:

In exploring statistical distributions, we focus on the following:

- what influences the shape of a distribution

- calculate probability from a given quantile

- calculate quantiles out of given probability


for the following distributions:

- Normal

- Binomial

- Chi Square

- F

- t


## Normal Distribution

### Distribution Shape

Visualize how changes in mean and standard deviation affect the shape of thenormal distribution.

### Percentiles

#### Calculate and visualize quantiles out of given probability.

##### Input

- probs: a probability value

- mean: mean of the normal distribution

- sd: standard deviation of the normal distribution

- type: lower/upper tail


Suppose X, the grade on a exam, is normally distributed with mean 60and standard deviation 3. The teacher wants to give 10% of the class an A.What should be the cutoff to determine who gets an A?

```
vdist_normal_perc(0.10, 60, 3, 'upper')
```

The teacher wants to give lower 15% of the class a D. What cutoff should theteacher use to determine who gets an D?

```
vdist_normal_perc(0.85, 60, 3, 'lower')
```

```
