“For all its tremendous power and benefits, Hadoop does have drawbacks. How it moves data is complex, and it’s not always the most efficient execution with Big Data and unstructured data processing. The automatic association between Big Data and Hadoop is becoming looser as more alternatives to Hadoop are developed. Some have speed advantages, while others allow streaming processing or make more efficient use of hardware. Hadoop alternatives are emerging, and those who deal with Big Data or unstructured data are wise to scope them out when considering their own needs.” Mark van Rijmenam ( 26.05.2015 )
