Suppose that you have a sample of a variable of interest, e.g. the heights of men in certain population, and for some obscured reason you are interest not in the mean height Î¼ but in its square Î¼Â². How would you inference on Î¼Â², e.g. test a hypothesis or calculate a confidnce interval? The delta method is the trick you need.

The delta method is mathematical assertion that can yield estimates for the varinance of functons of statistics under mild condition. Loosley speaking, let bâ‚™ is an estimate of Î², where n is the sample size, and the distribution of bâ‚™ is approximately normal with mean Î² and variance ÏƒÂ²/n.

Then, if g is a function, then g(bâ‚™) is approximately normal with mean g(Î²) and and variance [gâ€™(Î²)Â² ]â‹…ÏƒÂ²/n, provided that the sample size is large. Donâ€™t let the calculus scare you. Râ€™s deltmethod function will handle the calculus for you.

If bâ‚™ is a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of Î² then under mild conditions it is approximately normal for a large sample size, and g(bâ‚™) and gâ€™(bâ‚™) are MLEs for g(Î²) and gâ€™(Î²) respectively. Add on top of this a MLE for Ïƒ, and you can implement statistical inference.

I will demonstrate the use of the delta method using the Titanic survival data. For the sake of the example I will use only 3 variables: Survived is a 0/1 variable indicating whther a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic, Age is obviously the passengerâ€™s age, and Parch is the passengerâ€™s number of parents/children aboard. Lets take a look at some of the data:

Let Ï€ be the probability of surviving. Then the odds of survival is Ï€/(1-Ï€). The sample size is n=891 is considered large, so we can apply the Central Limit Theorem to conclude that p is approximately normal with mean Ï€ and variance Ï€/(1-Ï€)/n. Then Ï€ can be estimated by p=0.384, the odds are estimated by p/(1-p)=0.623, and the variance of p is estimated by 0.000265:

Let g(*x*)=p/(1-*x*). Then g`(*x*)=1/(1-*x*)Â², (you can check this at https://www.wolframalpha.com) so the variane of the odds can be estimated by

Var(p/(1-p))=[gâ€™(p)Â² ]â‹…ÏƒÂ²/n=[1/(1-p)Â²]Â² â‹… [p(1-p)/n].

This can be implemented in the following R code:

But of course, instead of doing all the calculus, you can use the deltamethod function of Râ€™s msm package.

The function has three parameters:

- g is a formula object representating of the transformation g(*x*). The formula variables must be labeled x1, x2 and so on.

- mean is the estimate of g(Î²)

- cov is the estimate of var(Î²) which is ÏƒÂ²/n


The use of the delta function provides the same result:

The second example considers logistic regression. We will model the (logit of the) probability of survival using Age nd Parch. Using Râ€™s glm function we can obtain estimates to the logistic regression coefficients band their standard errors se_b:

Since *exp*(Î²) is usually interpreted as the odd ratio (OR) of the response variable with regard to the regression independent variable, reseachers are interested in inference on *exp*(Î²). In order to perform such inference one nees to estimate the standard error of *exp*(Î²). Since b is a Maximum Likelihood Estimate for Î², it is approximately normal and its variance is estimated by se_bÂ², and the delta method can be applied.

The calculus in this case is easy: g(*x*)=*exp*(*x*), so gâ€™(*x*)=*exp*(*x*). Therefore, the standard error of *exp*(Î²) can be estimated by *exp*(b)â‹… se_b:

To use the deltamethod function, we will first use the vcov function to obtain the variance-covariance matrix of the resression coefficient estimates, and the variances will be the inputs of the deltamethod function:

Of course, we get the same results.
