**Applications of band-limited extrapolation to forecasting of weather and financial time series**

This paper describes the practical application of causal extrapolation of sequences for the purpose of forecasting. The methods and proofs have been applied to simulations to measure the range which data can be accurately extrapolated. Real world data from the Australian Stock exchange and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology have been tested and compared with simple linear extrapolation of the same data. In a majority of the tested scenarios casual extrapolation has been proved to be the more effective forecaster.

**A LoRaWAN Wireless Sensor Network for Data Center Temperature Monitoring**

High-performance computing installations, which are at the basis of web and cloud servers as well as supercomputers, are constrained by two main conflicting requirements: IT power consumption generated by the computing nodes and the heat that must be removed to avoid thermal hazards. In the worst cases, up to 60% of the energy consumed in a data center is used for cooling, often related to an over-designed cooling system. We propose a low-cost and battery-supplied wireless sensor network (WSN) for fine-grained, flexible and long-term data center temperature monitoring. The WSN has been operational collecting more than six million data points, with no losses, for six months without battery recharges. Our work reaches a 300x better energy efficiency than the previously reported WSNs for similar scenarios and on a 7x wider area. The data collected by the network can be used to optimize cooling effort while avoiding dangerous hot spots.

**Bayesian Anomaly Detection and Classification**

Statistical uncertainties are rarely incorporated in machine learning algorithms, especially for anomaly detection. Here we present the Bayesian Anomaly Detection And Classification (BADAC) formalism, which provides a unified statistical approach to classification and anomaly detection within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. BADAC deals with uncertainties by marginalising over the unknown, true, value of the data. Using simulated data with Gaussian noise, BADAC is shown to be superior to standard algorithms in both classification and anomaly detection performance in the presence of uncertainties, though with significantly increased computational cost. Additionally, BADAC provides well-calibrated classification probabilities, valuable for use in scientific pipelines. We show that BADAC can work in online mode and is fairly robust to model errors, which can be diagnosed through model-selection methods. In addition it can perform unsupervised new class detection and can naturally be extended to search for anomalous subsets of data. BADAC is therefore ideal where computational cost is not a limiting factor and statistical rigour is important. We discuss approximations to speed up BADAC, such as the use of Gaussian processes, and finally introduce a new metric, the Rank-Weighted Score (RWS), that is particularly suited to evaluating the ability of algorithms to detect anomalies.

**Trajectories of Blocked Community Members: Redemption, Recidivism and Departure**

Community norm violations can impair constructive communication and collaboration online. As a defense mechanism, community moderators often address such transgressions by temporarily blocking the perpetrator. Such actions, however, come with the cost of potentially alienating community members. Given this tradeoff, it is essential to understand to what extent, and in which situations, this common moderation practice is effective in reinforcing community rules. In this work, we introduce a computational framework for studying the future behavior of blocked users on Wikipedia. After their block expires, they can take several distinct paths: they can reform and adhere to the rules, but they can also recidivate, or straight-out abandon the community. We reveal that these trajectories are tied to factors rooted both in the characteristics of the blocked individual and in whether they perceived the block to be fair and justified. Based on these insights, we formulate a series of prediction tasks aiming to determine which of these paths a user is likely to take after being blocked for their first offense, and demonstrate the feasibility of these new tasks. Overall, this work builds towards a more nuanced approach to moderation by highlighting the tradeoffs that are in play.

**MPP: Model Performance Predictor**

Operations is a key challenge in the domain of machine learning pipeline deployments involving monitoring and management of real-time prediction quality. Typically, metrics like accuracy, RMSE etc., are used to track the performance of models in deployment. However, these metrics cannot be calculated in production due to the absence of labels. We propose using an ML algorithm, Model Performance Predictor (MPP), to track the performance of the models in deployment. We argue that an ensemble of such metrics can be used to create a score representing the prediction quality in production. This in turn facilitates formulation and customization of ML alerts, that can be escalated by an operations team to the data science team. Such a score automates monitoring and enables ML deployments at scale.

**Learning Hash Function through Codewords**

In this paper, we propose a novel hash learning approach that has the following main distinguishing features, when compared to past frameworks. First, the codewords are utilized in the Hamming space as ancillary techniques to accomplish its hash learning task. These codewords, which are inferred from the data, attempt to capture grouping aspects of the data’s hash codes. Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of addressing supervised, unsupervised and, even, semi-supervised hash learning scenarios. Additionally, the framework adopts a regularization term over the codewords, which automatically chooses the codewords for the problem. To efficiently solve the problem, one Block Coordinate Descent algorithm is showcased in the paper. We also show that one step of the algorithms can be casted into several Support Vector Machine problems which enables our algorithms to utilize efficient software package. For the regularization term, a closed form solution of the proximal operator is provided in the paper. A series of comparative experiments focused on content-based image retrieval highlights its performance advantages.

**Better Algorithms for Stochastic Bandits with Adversarial Corruptions**

We study the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem in the presence of adversarial corruption. We present a new algorithm for this problem whose regret is nearly optimal, substantially improving upon previous work. Our algorithm is agnostic to the level of adversarial contamination and can tolerate a significant amount of corruption with virtually no degradation in performance.

**Scalable Hyperbolic Recommender Systems**

We present a large scale hyperbolic recommender system. We discuss why hyperbolic geometry is a more suitable underlying geometry for many recommendation systems and cover the fundamental milestones and insights that we have gained from its development. In doing so, we demonstrate the viability of hyperbolic geometry for recommender systems, showing that they significantly outperform Euclidean models on datasets with the properties of complex networks. Key to the success of our approach are the novel choice of underlying hyperbolic model and the use of the Einstein midpoint to define an asymmetric recommender system in hyperbolic space. These choices allow us to scale to millions of users and hundreds of thousands of items.

**Saliency Learning: Teaching the Model Where to Pay Attention**

Deep learning has emerged as a compelling solution to many NLP tasks with remarkable performances. However, due to their opacity, such models are hard to interpret and trust. Recent work on explaining deep models has introduced approaches to provide insights toward the model’s behavior and predictions, which are helpful for determining the reliability of the model’s prediction. However, such methods do not fix and improve the model’s reliability. In this paper, we teach our models to make the right prediction for the right reason by providing explanation training signal and ensuring alignment of the models explanation with the ground truth explanation. Our experimental results on multiple tasks and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which produces more reliable predictions while delivering better results compared to traditionally trained models.

**What makes a good conversation? How controllable attributes affect human judgments**

A good conversation requires balance — between simplicity and detail; staying on topic and changing it; asking questions and answering them. Although dialogue agents are commonly evaluated via human judgments of overall quality, the relationship between quality and these individual factors is less well-studied. In this work, we examine two controllable neural text generation methods, conditional training and weighted decoding, in order to control four important attributes for chitchat dialogue: repetition, specificity, response-relatedness and question-asking. We conduct a large-scale human evaluation to measure the effect of these control parameters on multi-turn interactive conversations on the PersonaChat task. We provide a detailed analysis of their relationship to high-level aspects of conversation, and show that by controlling combinations of these variables our models obtain clear improvements in human quality judgments.

**Principal Component Projection with Low-Degree Polynomials**

In this paper, we consider approximations of principal component projection (PCP) without explicitly computing principal components. This problem has been studied in several recent works. The main feature of existing approaches is viewing the PCP matrix as a matrix function. This underlying function is the composition of a step function with a rational function. To find an approximate PCP, the step function is approximated by a polynomial while the rational function is evaluated by a fast ridge regression solver. In this work, we further improve this process by replacing the rational function with carefully constructed polynomials of low degree. We characterize the properties of polynomials that are suitable for approximating PCP, and establish an optimization problem to select the optimal one from those polynomials. We show theoretically and confirm numerically that the resulting approximate PCP approach with optimal polynomials is indeed effective for approximations of principal component projection.

**The Generalized Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square Algorithm**

We propose a novel adaptive kernel based regression method for complex-valued signals: the generalized complex-valued kernel least-mean-square (gCKLMS). We borrow from the new results on widely linear reproducing kernel Hilbert space (WL-RKHS) for nonlinear regression and complex-valued signals, recently proposed by the authors. This paper shows that in the adaptive version of the kernel regression for complex-valued signals we need to include another kernel term, the so-called pseudo-kernel. This new solution is endowed with better representation capabilities in complex-valued fields, since it can efficiently decouple the learning of the real and the imaginary part. Also, we review previous realizations of the complex KLMS algorithm and its augmented version to prove that they can be rewritten as particular cases of the gCKLMS. Furthermore, important conclusions on the kernels design are drawn that help to greatly improve the convergence of the algorithms. In the experiments, we revisit the nonlinear channel equalization problem to highlight the better convergence of the gCKLMS compared to previous solutions. Also, the flexibility of the proposed generalized approach is tested in a second experiment with non-independent real and imaginary parts. The results illustrate the significant performance improvements of the gCKLMS approach when the complex-valued signals have different properties for the real and imaginary parts.

**Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning**

Generalization to unknown/uncertain environments of reinforcement learning algorithms is crucial for real-world applications. In this work, we explicitly consider uncertainty associated with the test environment through an uncertainty set. We formulate the Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL) objective that consists in maximizing performance against a worst-case policy in uncertainty set centered at the reference policy. Based on this objective, we derive computationally efficient policy improvement algorithm that benefits from Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) guarantees. Further, we propose an iterative procedure that increases stability of learning, called Distributionally Robust Policy Iteration. Combined with maximum entropy framework, we derive a distributionally robust variant of Soft Q-learning that enjoys efficient practical implementation and produces policies with robust behaviour at test time. Our formulation provides a unified view on a number of safe RL algorithms and recent empirical successes.

**Unsupervised Visual Domain Adaptation: A Deep Max-Margin Gaussian Process Approach**

In unsupervised domain adaptation, it is widely known that the target domain error can be provably reduced by having a shared input representation that makes the source and target domains indistinguishable from each other. Very recently it has been studied that not just matching the marginal input distributions, but the alignment of output (class) distributions is also critical. The latter can be achieved by minimizing the maximum discrepancy of predictors (classifiers). In this paper, we adopt this principle, but propose a more systematic and effective way to achieve hypothesis consistency via Gaussian processes (GP). The GP allows us to define/induce a hypothesis space of the classifiers from the posterior distribution of the latent random functions, turning the learning into a simple large-margin posterior separation problem, far easier to solve than previous approaches based on adversarial minimax optimization. We formulate a learning objective that effectively pushes the posterior to minimize the maximum discrepancy. This is further shown to be equivalent to maximizing margins and minimizing uncertainty of the class predictions in the target domain, a well-established principle in classical (semi-)supervised learning. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach is comparable or superior to the existing methods on several benchmark domain adaptation datasets.

**AliGraph: A Comprehensive Graph Neural Network Platform**

An increasing number of machine learning tasks require dealing with large graph datasets, which capture rich and complex relationship among potentially billions of elements. Graph Neural Network (GNN) becomes an effective way to address the graph learning problem by converting the graph data into a low dimensional space while keeping both the structural and property information to the maximum extent and constructing a neural network for training and referencing. However, it is challenging to provide an efficient graph storage and computation capabilities to facilitate GNN training and enable development of new GNN algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive graph neural network system, namely AliGraph, which consists of distributed graph storage, optimized sampling operators and runtime to efficiently support not only existing popular GNNs but also a series of in-house developed ones for different scenarios. The system is currently deployed at Alibaba to support a variety of business scenarios, including product recommendation and personalized search at Alibaba’s E-Commerce platform. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with 492.90 million vertices, 6.82 billion edges and rich attributes, AliGraph performs an order of magnitude faster in terms of graph building (5 minutes vs hours reported from the state-of-the-art PowerGraph platform). At training, AliGraph runs 40%-50% faster with the novel caching strategy and demonstrates around 12 times speed up with the improved runtime. In addition, our in-house developed GNN models all showcase their statistically significant superiorities in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., 4.12%-17.19% lift by F1 scores).

**Robust Principal Components Analysis with Non-Sparse Errors**

We show that when a high-dimensional data matrix is the sum of a low-rank matrix and a random error matrix with independent entries, the low-rank component can be consistently estimated by solving a convex minimization problem. We develop a new theoretical argument to establish consistency without assuming sparsity or the existence of any moments of the error matrix, so that fat-tailed continuous random errors such as Cauchy are allowed. The results are illustrated by simulations.

**Linky: Visualizing User Identity Linkage Results For Multiple Online Social Networks**

User identity linkage across online social networks is an emerging research topic that has attracted attention in recent years. Many user identity linkage methods have been proposed so far and most of them utilize user profile, content and network information to determine if two social media accounts belong to the same person. In most cases, user identity linkage methods are evaluated by performing some prediction tasks with the results presented using some overall accuracy measures. However, the methods are rarely compared at the individual user level where a predicted matched (or linked) pair of user identities from different online social networks can be visually compared in terms of user profile (e.g. username), content and network information. Such a comparison is critical to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method. In this work, we present Linky, a visual analytical tool which extracts the results from different user identity linkage methods performed on multiple online social networks and visualizes the user profiles, content and ego networks of the linked user identities. Linky is designed to help researchers to (a) inspect the linked user identities at the individual user level, (b) compare results returned by different user linkage methods, and (c) provide a preliminary empirical understanding on which aspects of the user identities, e.g. profile, content or network, contributed to the user identity linkage results.

**Behavioral Petri Net Mining and Automated Analysis for Human-Computer Interaction Recommendations in Multi-Application Environments**

Process Mining is a famous technique which is frequently applied to Software Development Processes, while being neglected in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) recommendation applications. Organizations usually train employees to interact with required IT systems. Often, employees, or users in general, develop their own strategies for solving repetitive tasks and processes. However, organizations find it hard to detect whether employees interact efficiently with IT systems or not. Hence, we have developed a method which detects inefficient behavior assuming that at least one optimal HCI strategy is known. This method provides recommendations to gradually adapt users’ behavior towards the optimal way of interaction considering satisfaction of users. Based on users’ behavior logs tracked by a Java application suitable for multi-application and multi-instance environments, we demonstrate the applicability for a specific task in a common Windows environment utilizing realistic simulated behaviors of users.

**A visual encoding model based on deep neural networks and transfer learning**

Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals, visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also assume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity. However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve prediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e., V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy. Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings from visual features to brain activity.

**VCWE: Visual Character-Enhanced Word Embeddings**

Chinese is a logographic writing system, and the shape of Chinese characters contain rich syntactic and semantic information. In this paper, we propose a model to learn Chinese word embeddings via two-level composition: (1) a convolutional neural network to extract the intra-character compositionality from the visual shape of a character; (2) a recurrent neural network with self-attention to compose character representation into word embeddings. The word embeddings along with the network parameters are learned in the Skip-Gram framework. Evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our model on four tasks: word similarity, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.

**A Degeneracy Framework for Scalable Graph Autoencoders**

In this paper, we present a general framework to scale graph autoencoders (AE) and graph variational autoencoders (VAE). This framework leverages graph degeneracy concepts to train models only from a dense subset of nodes instead of using the entire graph. Together with a simple yet effective propagation mechanism, our approach significantly improves scalability and training speed while preserving performance. We evaluate and discuss our method on several variants of existing graph AE and VAE, providing the first application of these models to large graphs with up to millions of nodes and edges. We achieve empirically competitive results w.r.t. several popular scalable node embedding methods, which emphasizes the relevance of pursuing further research towards more scalable graph AE and VAE.

**Augmenting Neural Machine Translation with Knowledge Graphs**

While neural networks have been used extensively to make substantial progress in the machine translation task, they are known for being heavily dependent on the availability of large amounts of training data. Recent efforts have tried to alleviate the data sparsity problem by augmenting the training data using different strategies, such as back-translation. Along with the data scarcity, the out-of-vocabulary words, mostly entities and terminological expressions, pose a difficult challenge to Neural Machine Translation systems. In this paper, we hypothesize that knowledge graphs enhance the semantic feature extraction of neural models, thus optimizing the translation of entities and terminological expressions in texts and consequently leading to a better translation quality. We hence investigate two different strategies for incorporating knowledge graphs into neural models without modifying the neural network architectures. We also examine the effectiveness of our augmentation method to recurrent and non-recurrent (self-attentional) neural architectures. Our knowledge graph augmented neural translation model, dubbed KG-NMT, achieves significant and consistent improvements of +3 BLEU, METEOR and chrF3 on average on the newstest datasets between 2014 and 2018 for WMT English-German translation task.

**Accelerating Rescaled Gradient Descent**

The connection between continuous-time dynamics and discrete-time algorithms has led to the introduction of many methods in optimization. We add to this body of work by introducing a family of descent dynamics and descent algorithms with matching non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. We use this framework to introduce a new first-order algorithm, called rescaled gradient descent (RGD), and show that RGD achieves a faster convergence rate than gradient descent provided the function is strongly smooth – a natural generalization of the standard smoothness assumption on the objective function. When the objective function is convex, we present two frameworks for accelerating descent methods, one in the style of Nesterov and the other in the style of Monteiro and Svaiter. Rescaled gradient descent can be accelerated under the same strong smoothness assumption using both frameworks. We provide several examples of strongly smooth loss functions in machine learning and numerical experiments that verify our theoretical findings.

**Categorization in the Wild: Generalizing Cognitive Models to Naturalistic Data across Languages**

Categories such as animal or furniture are acquired at an early age and play an important role in processing, organizing, and communicating world knowledge. Categories exist across cultures: they allow to efficiently represent the complexity of the world, and members of a community strongly agree on their nature, revealing a shared mental representation. Models of category learning and representation, however, are typically tested on data from small-scale experiments involving small sets of concepts with artificially restricted features; and experiments predominantly involve participants of selected cultural and socio-economical groups (very often involving western native speakers of English such as U.S. college students) . This work investigates whether models of categorization generalize (a) to rich and noisy data approximating the environment humans live in; and (b) across languages and cultures. We present a Bayesian cognitive model designed to jointly learn categories and their structured representation from natural language text which allows us to (a) evaluate performance on a large scale, and (b) apply our model to a diverse set of languages. We show that meaningful categories comprising hundreds of concepts and richly structured featural representations emerge across languages. Our work illustrates the potential of recent advances in computational modeling and large scale naturalistic datasets for cognitive science research.

**Vector of Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE): A novel document-level embedding**

In this paper, we propose a novel representation for text documents based on aggregating word embedding vectors into document embeddings. Our approach is inspired by the Vector of Locally-Aggregated Descriptors used for image representation, and it works as follows. First, the word embeddings gathered from a collection of documents are clustered by k-means in order to learn a codebook of semnatically-related word embeddings. Each word embedding is then associated to its nearest cluster centroid (codeword). The Vector of Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE) representation of a document is then computed by accumulating the differences between each codeword vector and each word vector (from the document) associated to the respective codeword. We plug the VLAWE representation, which is learned in an unsupervised manner, into a classifier and show that it is useful for a diverse set of text classification tasks. We compare our approach with a broad range of recent state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we obtain a considerable improvement on the Movie Review data set, reporting an accuracy of 93.3%, which represents an absolute gain of 10% over the state-of-the-art approach.

**Evidence Sentence Extraction for Machine Reading Comprehension**

Recently remarkable success has been achieved in machine reading comprehension (MRC). However, it is still difficult to interpret the predictions of existing MRC models. In this paper, we focus on: extracting evidence sentences that can explain/support answer predictions for multiple-choice MRC tasks, where the majority of answer options cannot be directly extracted from reference documents; studying the impacts of using the extracted sentences as the input of MRC models. Due to the lack of ground truth evidence sentence labels in most cases, we apply distant supervision to generate imperfect labels and then use them to train a neural evidence extractor. To denoise the noisy labels, we treat labels as latent variables and define priors over these latent variables by incorporating rich linguistic knowledge under a recently proposed deep probabilistic logic learning framework. We feed the extracted evidence sentences into existing MRC models and evaluate the end-to-end performance on three challenging multiple-choice MRC datasets: MultiRC, DREAM, and RACE, achieving comparable or better performance than the same models that take the full context as input. Our evidence extractor also outperforms a state-of-the-art sentence selector by a large margin on two open-domain question answering datasets: Quasar-T and SearchQA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing evidence sentence extraction for multiple-choice MRC.

**Rethinking Action Spaces for Reinforcement Learning in End-to-end Dialog Agents with Latent Variable Models**

Defining action spaces for conversational agents and optimizing their decision-making process with reinforcement learning is an enduring challenge. Common practice has been to use handcrafted dialog acts, or the output vocabulary, e.g. in neural encoder decoders, as the action spaces. Both have their own limitations. This paper proposes a novel latent action framework that treats the action spaces of an end-to-end dialog agent as latent variables and develops unsupervised methods in order to induce its own action space from the data. Comprehensive experiments are conducted examining both continuous and discrete action types and two different optimization methods based on stochastic variational inference. Results show that the proposed latent actions achieve superior empirical performance improvement over previous word-level policy gradient methods on both DealOrNoDeal and MultiWoz dialogs. Our detailed analysis also provides insights about various latent variable approaches for policy learning and can serve as a foundation for developing better latent actions in future research.

**Aggregating E-commerce Search Results from Heterogeneous Sources via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**

In this paper, we investigate the task of aggregating search results from heterogeneous sources in an E-commerce environment. First, unlike traditional aggregated web search that merely presents multi-sourced results in the first page, this new task may present aggregated results in all pages and has to dynamically decide which source should be presented in the current page. Second, as pointed out by many existing studies, it is not trivial to rank items from heterogeneous sources because the relevance scores from different source systems are not directly comparable. To address these two issues, we decompose the task into two subtasks in a hierarchical structure: a high-level task for source selection where we model the sequential patterns of user behaviors onto aggregated results in different pages so as to understand user intents and select the relevant sources properly; and a low-level task for item presentation where we formulate a slot filling process to sequentially present the items instead of giving each item a relevance score when deciding the presentation order of heterogeneous items. Since both subtasks can be naturally formulated as sequential decision problems and learn from the future user feedback on search results, we build our model with hierarchical reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model obtains remarkable improvements in search performance metrics, and achieves a higher user satisfaction.
