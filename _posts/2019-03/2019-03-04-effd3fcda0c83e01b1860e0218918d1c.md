I ran the second iteration of my Successfully Delivering Data Science Projects course last Friday to this happy group, we had a lovely day and good conversation has continued in the teaching slack over the weekend:

Topics covered included the design and derisking of data projects (not just machine learning), building a project plan, communicating effectively with non-data science stakeholders, cost/benefits analysis, tooling, hiring and the process of actually getting R&D models shipped and supported. The conversation was both similar and nicely different to the Q&A topics that came up in the previous iteration.

I haven’t got a date yet for the next iteration, it’ll be in a couple of months. I may also run something on Software Engineer for Data Scientists and another on Higher Performance Python, possibly I’ll run one on NLP with a colleague. You can sign-up for notifications on my very low-volume mailing list if you’d like to hear when courses become available.

I’m doing research into which other topics might be most pressing in London – I’d be curious to know what *you’d like to learn* in the next 6 months if a course were run in London. The survey attached has 1 question with 1 choice and there’s no sign-up. There is a second question box to take your email (entirely optional) which will get you a discount code valid for the year.
