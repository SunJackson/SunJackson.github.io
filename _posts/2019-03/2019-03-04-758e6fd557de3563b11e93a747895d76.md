Students have the option to select the base program with coursework tightly focused on database design, large-scale data and warehouses, and data-driven decision making. However, the program can be customized by selecting an option in either business analytics or marketing analytics.

Penn State’s online curriculum is also integrated, so courses associated with these concentrations also meet the requirements for the Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics or the Graduate Certificate in Marketing Analytics.  This embedded structure allows students to earn a graduate certificate while in pursuit of their master’s degree.

Students can customize their program further by selecting elective courses that are most appropriate for their unique career goals. Elective topics include data visualization, deep learning, network and predictive analytics, advanced database design, large-scale databases for real-world analytics, regression methods, technical project management, and more.

Penn State currently has more than 300 part-time students in the online program, 75 percent of which reside outside of the state of Pennsylvania. Students have an average of 5 to 7 years of work experience and have some degree of quantitative skills in their background.
