When we TATVA AI visit our clients, often both data scientists and higher management ask us, how we deal with both  Python and R simultaneously for client requests; as there is no universal preference among clients.

Though solution is not straight forward, however, I suggest to exploit common libraries for quick deployments, such as, dfply (python) and dplyr (R). Below is a quick example:

## R Codelibrary(dplyr)testdata %>% filter(col.1==10)

## Python Codefrom dfply import *testdata >> filter_by(X.col.1==10)



Happy R and Python Programming!
