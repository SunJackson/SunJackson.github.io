Do you remember the days before Uber, Lyft, or Gett? Standing in the street trying to hail a taxi waiting for the moment a free cab might drive by and spot you? These days that world seems so far away. And you might often wonder: how do these apps work? After all, that set price is not a random guess.

*"I get out of the taxi and it’s probably the only city which in reality looks better than on the postcards, New York.’"― Milos Forman*

In the last few years, the number of for-hire vehicles operating in NY has grown from 63,000 to more than 100,000. However, while the number of trips in app-based vehicles has increased from 6 million to 17 million a year, taxi trips have fallen from 11 million to 8.5 million. Hence, the NY Yellow Cab organization decided to become more data-centric. 

Providing data from past rides, they asked the data scientist community on Kaggle to design the best machine learning (ML) model to predict the fare of their taxi rides. This post walks through how we  developed our ML model, deployed it in real time, and built a web application for anyone to use it.

## Data Discovery

When we first discovered the raw data, we were quite disappointed. It appeared to contain only a handful of features: the location and time of the pickup, the location of the drop-off point, and the number of passengers. But when we started digging deeper, we actually unveiled some interesting findings:

- Some people take round trips that can last for up to five hours and cost more than $800 (one could easily have rented a private limo with a driver for the same amount).

- A trip inside Manhattan might hurt your pocket a lot more than an airport ride (reaching up to $400, while a trip to an airport has a flat rate)


Initially, we expected distance to be the main factor impacting the fare. But as shown in the plot below, the relationship between the two is not so straightforward (read: linear).

*What are these rides above 300 kilometers?!*

 

As you can expect in real life, we discovered multiple cases of bad data. For instance, over five years of history, there were more than 100,000 cases of rides above 300 kilometers. We found funny outliers like rides costing $94,000 and rides to the bottom of the Hudson River, which is something that you don’t want your model to learn from, do you? You want to give it only good, reasonable examples to learn from. So we started by identifying and filtering out this dirty data.

## Feature Engineering

From then on, we thought about what features influence the taxi fare. All in all, the journey to spot the best features was not easy. If you don’t limit your imagination you’ll end up with hundreds of (usually) useless features. 

Indeed, after many iterations, we went from eight features in the raw data to more than 500! At that point, our models started to perform worse as models learned “spurious correlations.” Fortunately, we had the right tools to help us with that. Using the feature importance for manual selection and the automatic feature reduction tool built into Dataiku, we were able to reduce the number of features to around 100.

We started by building location-related features based on the raw data: geometrical distances between pickup and dropoff points, the direction of the trip (north/south/east/west), etc. We added features based on the date and the time in order to capture seasonality effects.

After some positive iterations, we decided to combine location-related and time-related features to describe the traffic conditions for a specific route at a given time. To do so, we needed to define a notion of “neighborhood,” which did not exist in the raw data.

We decided to put the data decide through clustering. Interestingly, a simple K-means clustering algorithm was able to identify New York neighborhoods quite accurately:

Then, we used the Window recipe to compute useful features such as the average fare for a ride for one cluster to another in the last 10 rides, the last 100 rides, etc. More importantly, using neighborhoods of pickup and dropoff as a unique route identifier, we added data from the HERE API to estimate driving conditions including traffic. We called this API to retrieve historical data on all possible routes for all hours at a given day of the week, and enrich our original dataset.

Finally, the “business rules” that taxi meters follow to make price calculations (check out this open data) were an excellent reference to create more features. Airport flat rates, peak time price raises, Manhattan traffic charges, tunnel charges, etc., were a few of the most significant features we fed into our model.

## Training

Along with our iterations of data cleaning, wrangling, and enriching, we did many iterations of machine learning model training. The main challenge we faced was the sheer size of the dataset - it wouldn’t fit in our server memory! 

We also had to tune the hyperparameters of this model quite a lot. Why? To defeat the archenemy of all data scientist: Overfitting!
