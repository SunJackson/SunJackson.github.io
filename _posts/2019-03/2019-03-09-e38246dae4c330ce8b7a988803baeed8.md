A minor RcppArmadillo bugfix release arrived on CRAN today. This version 0.9.200.7.1 has two local changes. R 3.6.0 will bring a change in `sample()` (to correct a subtle bug for large samples) meaning many tests will fail, so in one unit test file we reset the generator to the old behaviour to ensure we match the (old) test expectation. We also backported a prompt upstream fix for an issue with drawing Wishart-distributed random numbers via Armadillo which was uncovered this week. I also just uploaded the Debian version.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 559 other packages on CRAN.

Changed are listed below:

> 
Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.9.200.7.1 (2019-03-08)


Explicit setting of `RNGversion("3.5.0")` in one unit test to accomodate the change in `sample()` in R 3.6.0


Back-ported a fix to the Wishart RNG from upstream (Dirk in #248 fixing #247)




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
