```
love_verse <- function(w1, w2, w3){
 glue::glue(
 "Love is {b}, {b} is love
 Love is {y}, {y} love
 Love is {u} to be loved", 
 b = w1, y = w2, u = w3)
}
```

As a return, parameters sometimes gives echoes of poetry.

```
love_verse('real', 'feeling', 'wanting')
```

```
Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
```

```
love_verse('touch', 'reaching', 'asking')
```

```
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
```

```
## refrain
```

```
Love is you
You and me
Love is knowing
We can be
```

```
love_verse('free', 'living', 'needing')
```

```
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved
```

 list(w1 = 'touch', w2 = 'reaching', w3 = 'asking' ),
 list(w1 = 'free', w2 = 'living', w3 = 'needing')) %>% 
 purrr::map(function(x)do.call(love_verse, x))
```
