This post is part of a running series on Bayesian MCMC tutorials. For updates, follow @StableMarkets. Metropolis Review Metropolis-Hastings is an MCMC algorithm for drawing samples from a distribution known up to a constant of proportionality, ![](//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%5Ctheta+%7C+y%29+%5Cpropto+p%28y%7C%5Ctheta%29p%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0)
