**Generalizable Approaching Policy LEarning (GAPLE)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We study the problem of learning a generalizable action policy for an intelligent agent to actively approach an object of interest in indoor environment solely from its visual inputs. While scene-driven or recognition-driven visual navigation has been widely studied, prior efforts suffer severely from the limited generalization capability. In this paper, we first argue the object searching task is environment dependent while the approaching ability is general. To learn a generalizable approaching policy, we present a novel solution dubbed as GAPLE which adopts two channels of visual features: depth and semantic segmentation, as the inputs to the policy learning module. The empirical studies conducted on the House3D dataset as well as on a physical platform in a real world scenario validate our hypothesis, and we further provide in-depth qualitative analysis. … 

**Semantic Tagging** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Semantic Tagging is the process of associating an element from an ontology with some document, usually a computer file or website. Semantic tagging serves the goal of describing a document in order to facilitate better retrieval later on. Semantic tagging also helps to integrate the tagged document with other resources that are also related to the same ontology. Semantic tagging is a special kind of annotation.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)
 What can we learn from Semantic Tagging? … 

**Smirnov Tree** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We introduce a generalization of Smirnov words in the context of labeled binary trees, which we call Smirnov trees. We study the generating function for ascent-descent statistics on Smirnov trees and establish that it is $e$-positive, which is akin to the classical case of Smirnov words. Our proof relies on an intricate weight-preserving bijection. …
