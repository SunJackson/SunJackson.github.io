Content Expanded View – Improve discoverability with descriptions and images

## Updates

### Authentication Migration Tools

It is now possible to delete users, transfer content ownership, and changeauthentication mechanisms for users and groups in RStudio Connect. This enablesseveral workflows that were previously impossible:

- Migrate authentication providers when prompted by IT

- Transition a Proof-of-Concept environment with “starter” authentication into a production context

- Clean up and remove users who are no longer relevant for the system


All of this functionality is available with the usermanager CLItool. Aspecific walkthrough of these workflows is available in the RStudio ConnectAdminGuide.

### Group Support for PAM and Proxied Authentication

Group support has been enabled for all authentication providers in RStudioConnect. The following grid illustrates the type of group support available forthe different authentication providers:

|Authentication Provider|Local Groups|Remote Groups
|------
|Password|Yes||
|LDAP / Active Directory||Yes|
|SAML|Yes||
|Google OAuth2|Yes||
|PAM|Yes||
|Proxied Authentication|Yes|Yes|

LDAP and Active Directory groups are managed by the authentication provider(i.e., are configured and maintained in your LDAP or Active Directory server).For the other authentication providers, groups are stored and managed insideRStudio Connect. They can be managed in the groups UI (under People) or via theRStudio Connect Server API.

### SAML Authentication (Beta Release)

RStudio Connect now supports using SAML as an authentication provider tosupport single sign-on (SSO). If you use SAML as anauthentication provider, we encourage you to try this feature in your testenvironment by integrating with your SAML Identity Provider. Any feedback youhave to share will be appreciated.

> 
*SAML integration is a Beta feature of RStudio Connect. Beta features aresupported and unlikely to face breaking changes in a future release. Anyissues found in the feature will be addressed during the regular releaseschedule; they will not result in immediate patches or hotfixes. We encouragecustomers to try these features and welcome any feedback, but recommend thefeature not be used in production until it is in general availability.


### View Scheduled Content

Administrators can now review all scheduled content in the RStudio Connectdashboard. The Scheduled Content view helps you understand how server resourceswill be used over time. Scheduled content can be filtered by frequency ofexecution, letting you focus on the items that run most often.

### Usage Metrics Summaries

A summary of recent usage is shown to content owners and administrators withinthe “Info” settings panel in the RStudio Connect dashboard. Metrics aredisplayed for Shiny applications and rendered/static content; they are notavailable for other content types.

Usage data for the content item is summarized to show the last 30 days ofactivity across all associated versions and variants. Document content itemswill display a chart of the daily visit count and a total visit counter for thepast 30-day period. Shiny applications will have the same statistics displayed,plus a metric for total user interaction time.

### Python Support

In case you missed it, RStudio Connect1.7.0introduced support for publishing Jupyter Notebooks as well as Shinyapplications, R Markdown reports, and plumber APIs that combine R andPython.Today, we’re excited to share that publishing Jupyter Notebooks is easier thanever; start by downloading thersconnect-jupyter Notebookextension, now available on PyPi.

## Additional Updates

- **Generate Diagnostic Reports and Support Bundles** This diagnostic reportcan be used by administrators to verify the status and configuration of yourRStudio Connect instance. The report also helps you work with our support team by collecting information and logs from your environment to help us quickly identify common issues and reduce the amount of time required to resolve them.See the Getting Started section of the AdminGuidefor more information.

- **API Versioning Documentation** The versioning scheme of the Connect ServerAPI, including definitions for “experimental” endpoints and a deprecationstrategy, is now included in the APIReference documentation.

- **Expanded Content View** (Screenshot in introduction) Expanded view showscontent descriptions and images in addition to the information available inthe familiar compact view. It is available to all users who can view thecontent list. This expanded view can help viewers navigate and discover thevaluable data products your data science teams create.


## Security & Authentication Changes

- **Browser Configurations** Fixed an issue where certain browserconfigurations caused environment variable values to be stored in thebrowser’s autofill cache.

- **OAuth2 Usernames** Rules for generating OAuth2 usernames are documented inthe Admin Guide section forOAuth2.

- **LDAP Usernames** Login failures due to case-sensitivity handling in LDAPusernames have been fixed. This fix also applies to proxied authenticationwhen using a UniqueID distinct from the username.


## Deprecations, Breaking Changes & Bug Fixes

- **Breaking Change** Publishers can no longer create groups. The creation ofgroups by publishers without consent from an administrator made it harderto ensure limited access to content. All publisher-owned groups currently in existence will remain, but any new group creation by publishers will be blocked. To restore the previousbehavior and allow publishers to create groups, use the new setting:`Authorization.PublishersCanOwnGroups`

- **Breaking Change** API requests with a malformed GUID in a path segmentreturn a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code rather than a `404 Not Found`.

- **Bug Fix** Shiny App usage historical information had the `started` timestampstored in the local timezone while the `end` timestamp was in UTC. Now both arestored in UTC; existing records will be adjusted automatically during the course of the upgrade.


Please review the full release notes

Upgrade Planning
If you rely on publisher-created groups in RStudioConnect, please make note of the breaking changes described above and in therelease notes.
Due to the bug fix on historical timestamp information forShiny App usage, upgrades could take several minutes depending on the numberof records to be adjusted.
Aside from the breaking changes above, there areno other special considerations. If you are upgrading from an earlierversion, be sure to consult the release notes for the intermediate releases,as well.
