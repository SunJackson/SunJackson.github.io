“So we’ve defined that big data is big, comes from many sources, and is growing at a staggering rate. This is the problem that a data platform is trying to solve. It’s more than just a large storage pool, NoSQL database and map reduce. A data platform is a set of tools that is designed to solve the inherent problems of handling, analyzing and getting actionable intelligence from big data.” Kevin Daly ( 10.11.2014 )
