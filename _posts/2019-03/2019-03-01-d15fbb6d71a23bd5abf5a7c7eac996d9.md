The R Journal is the open access, refereed journal of the R project for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that should be of interest to users or developers of R.

Christoph Weiss, Gernot Roetzer and myself have joined forces to write an R package and the accompanied paper: **Forecast Combinations in R using the ForecastComb Package**, which is now published in the R journal. Below you can find a few of my thoughts about the journey towards publication in the R journal, and a few words about working with a small team of three, from three different locations. 

The road to publishing in the R journal is not easy. The journal is peer-reviewed, and peers chosen are very knowledgeable, which means there are valuable and valid comments to address. Apart from that, and unlike with other publications you may have already, given that it is a computing journal the code is also scrutinized for bugs and important possible extensions. That said, the quality at the end is undoubtedly improved. 

Communication and treatment from the R journal is excellent. You are assigned with associate editor who distributes the prospective publication to few referees. Then you get an email describing the next steps and associated (expected) time lines. The whole system can be described as *responsive*.

The R journal itself is growing in popularity, and in impact:
