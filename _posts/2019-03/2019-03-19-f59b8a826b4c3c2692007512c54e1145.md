From https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html:

> 
There are two important new features inspired by other R packages that have been advancing of reshaping in R:

- The reshaping operation can be specified with a data frame that describes precisely how metadata stored in column names becomes data variables (and vice versa). This is inspired by the `cdata` package by John Mount and Nina Zumel. For simple uses of `pivot_long()` and `pivot_wide()`, this specification is implicit, but for more complex cases it is useful to make it explicit, and operate on the specification data frame using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
- pivot_long() can work with multiple value variables that may have different types. This is inspired by the enhanced `melt()` and `dcast()` functions provided by the `data.table` package by Matt Dowle and Arun Srinivasan.



If you want to work in the above way we suggest giving our `cdata` package a try. We named the functions `pivot_to_rowrecs` and `unpivot_to_blocks`. The idea was: by emphasizing the record structure one might eventually internalize what the transforms are doing. On the way to that we have a lot of documentation and tutorials.
