**By Impetus.**Sponsored Post.Apache Spark, a fast in-memory data processing engine and a distributed computing framework, can handle all needs for batch and streaming data processing, analytics and machine learning. Large data-driven enterprises are using Spark for tasks ranging from ingestion, ETL, and data quality processing to advanced analytics and machine learning.

Despite its growing popularity, Spark is complex, and the learning curve is steep. Developing code, integrating and testing with Spark is often time-consuming.

StreamAnalytix, a visual big data analytics platform offers a low-code solution to the complexities of building enterprise-grade Spark applications.

StreamAnalytix is now available on the AWS Marketplace. StreamAnalytix allows users to **rapidly build and operationalize Apache Spark applications** (**up-to 10x faster vs. hand-coding), while working with single or multiple Spark nodes.** StreamAnalytix on AWS Marketplace further simplifies Spark development in the cloud, making it easy for existing enterprise teams to build applications instantly with basic Spark understanding and minimal set-up time.
