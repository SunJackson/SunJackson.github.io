Our next Community Call, on March 27th, aims to help people learn about using rOpenSciâ€™s R packages to access and analyze taxonomy and biodiversity data, and to recognize the breadth and depth of their applications. We also aim to learn from the discussion how we might improve these tools. Presentations will start with an introduction to the topic and details on some specific packages and weâ€™ll hear from several people about their â€œuse cases in the wildâ€�.

#### Agenda

1. Stefanie Butland â€“ welcome (5 min)

1. **Scott Chamberlain** â€“ introduction and `taxize`, `taxizedb`, `rgbif`, `spocc` (10 min)

1. **Zachary Foster** â€“ `taxa` and `metacoder` (10 min)

1. **Margaret Siple** â€“ using `taxize` to get IUCN statuses for species found via DNA barcoding of seafood samples and compare them among genera (4 min)

1. **Kathryn Turner** â€“ a use case for `taxize` and `rgbif` to get all available occurrence records from GBIF for a handful of species, and scaling up to several thousand (4 min)

1. **Kari Norman** â€“ learning lessons in building `taxadb`, a local database approach for working with taxonomic names (4 min)

1. **Ciera Martinez** â€“ exploring biodiversity data with undergraduate data scientists using `taxize` and database specific tools like `neotomoa`, `paleoDB`, and `rglobi` (4 min)

1. Q & A (20 min)

#### Tell us about your use cases

Weâ€™ve tried to make it easy for you to tell us about how you have used our packages. Go to the UseCases category in our public forum. Starting a â€œNew Topicâ€� opens a template that suggests what to provide, like the name of the rOpenSci tool or resource you used, a link to a post or code snippet, and a few other optional things. We might share your use case during the Call or tweet about it, so be sure to give your twitter handle.

#### Have a question for the speakers?

Add yours to the comments below. See a question youâ€™d like to have answered? Give it a â�¤ï¸�. The moderator may select some of these questions to ask during Q & A.
