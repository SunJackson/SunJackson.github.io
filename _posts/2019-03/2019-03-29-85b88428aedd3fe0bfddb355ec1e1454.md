**By Denitsa Yordanova**, Data Science Society.

After five successful editions of the**worldwide Data Science Hackathon**, organized by Data Science Society, it’s time to bring the global data science community together again and challenge them with interesting data cases. In April, participants from **more than 30 countries,** will explore real-world challenges and come up with **artificial intelligence models** to solve them.

### Datathon 2019

The Datathon is a weekend-long hackathon: **12-14 April**. People from all over the world will have the chance to team up virtually, or to gather physically in several locations, with the end goal to develop **machine learning algorithms** based on the provided **datasets**.

### The Data Science Cases

Some of the previous Datathon cases were focused on **propaganda identification, DNA analysis and social network analysis**. This time, all passionate data scientists, will be exposed to real **computer vision**and**predictive analytics**cases:

- One of the largest retailers in the world has prepared an **image recognition dataset**for the Datathon. The participants should apply skills in computer vision and successfully detect objects based on а set of drone images.

- Another interesting case aims at finding out what is affecting air pollution. The Municipality of an EU capital, together with data-driven companies, have collected data from a variety of sources, including meteorological data, traffic data and data about population’s heating choice, that might impact the quality of air.


### Data Science Society

Data Science Society is a volunteer organization providing challenges entirely focused on the **open source culture** of creating code and algorithms. The mission is to share practical knowledge for others to learn and grow in the domain. The society is building a global network of individuals, mentors, organizations and partners willing to make sense of data.

**Join the international Datathon -** **Book your physical or virtual place****before 8th of April!**
