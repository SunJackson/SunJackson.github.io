**AutoEncoder Feature Selector (AEFS)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
High-dimensional data in many areas such as computer vision and machine learning brings in computational and analytical difficulty. Feature selection which select a subset of features from original ones has been proven to be effective and efficient to deal with high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel AutoEncoder Feature Selector (AEFS) for unsupervised feature selection. AEFS is based on the autoencoder and the group lasso regularization. Compared to traditional feature selection methods, AEFS can select the most important features in spite of nonlinear and complex correlation among features. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method regularized self-representation (RSR) for unsupervised feature selection. In order to deal with noise and corruption, we also propose robust AEFS. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed for model optimization and experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. … 

**Functional Intrusive Load Monitor (FILM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an important application to monitor household appliance activities and provide related information to house owner or/and utility company via a single sensor installed at the electrical entry of the house. It can be used for different purposes in residential and industrial sectors. Thus, an increasing number of new algorithms have been developed in recent years. In these algorithms, researchers either use existing public datasets or collect their own data which causes such problems as insufficiency of electrical parameters, missing of ground-truth data, absence of many appliances, and lack of appliance information. To solve these problems, this paper presents a model-based platform for NILM system development, namely Functional Intrusive Load Monitor (FILM). By using this platform, the state transitions and activities of all the involved appliances can be preset by researchers, and multiple electrical parameters such as harmonics and power factor can be monitored or calculated. This platform will help researchers save the time of collecting experimental data, utilize precise control of individual appliance activities, and develop load signatures of devices. This paper describes the steps, structure, and requirements of building this platform. Case study is presented to help understand this platform. … 

**Quaternion Long-Short Term Memory (QLSTM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are at the core of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In particular, long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in many speech recognition tasks, due to their efficient representation of long and short term dependencies in sequences of inter-dependent features. Nonetheless, internal dependencies within the element composing multidimensional features are weakly considered by traditional real-valued representations. We propose a novel quaternion long-short term memory (QLSTM) recurrent neural network that takes into account both the external relations between the features composing a sequence, and these internal latent structural dependencies with the quaternion algebra. QLSTMs are compared to LSTMs during a memory copy-task and a realistic application of speech recognition on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset. QLSTM reaches better performances during the two experiments with up to $2.8$ times less learning parameters, leading to a more expressive representation of the information. …
