Motion has a powerful effect on memory. Manning's liveVideo courses kick your learning into high gear with live coding, engaging animations, and hands-on exercises guaranteed to light up your brain. 


We believe you'll love learning in liveVideo. Every liveVideo course includes several FREE preview modules. You'll be able to check out the course and also give the liveVideo platform a test drive. Go have a look for yourself!


We're also sure that you'll like what you see in the free modules and want to see more, but to make the decision (to purchase) even easier, you can try out our liveVideo platform this month and it won't weigh down your wallet too much -- 
**all liveVideo courses are just $25! **


That's right! All of them. For the entire month of March.
