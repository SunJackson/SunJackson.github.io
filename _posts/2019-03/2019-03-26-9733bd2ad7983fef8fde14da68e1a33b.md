**27.03.2019**

A new release of Bio7 is available which is built upon Eclipse 4.11 and the latest Java OpenJDK. This new version comes bundled with OpenJDK 12, supports the dynamic compilation of Java 11 and fixes several annoying bugs on MacOSX (e.g., shutdown crashes). 

The R interface has been improved and the R-Shell now updates the workspace display automatically after a R code evaluation or R data transfer.

In additon for Bio7 3.0 the themes have been improved (especially for MacOSX and the Mojave dark mode) and some Touch Bar actions for MacOSX are available, too (if the MacOSX device has a Touch Bar).

### **Download and Installation:**

### **Windows:**

Just download the *.zip distribution file from https://bio7.org and unzip it in your preferred location. Bio7 comes bundled with a Java Runtime Environment, R and Rserve distribution and works out of the box.

### **Linux:**

Download and extract the installation file from https://bio7.org.For Linux you have to install R and Rserve (see Rserve installation below!).

### MacOSX:

Download and extract the installation file from https://bio7.org.

**If you start Bio7 a warning or error can occur because of the changes how Apple treats signatures! To allow Bio7 to start see this instructions for Yosemite, Sierra and Mojave:**

Yosemite: Open an app from an unidentified developer

Sierra: Open an app from an unidentified developer

Moave and Sierra: How to fix “Application” is damaged and can’t be opened error in macOS Mojave and High Sierra.

In addition for MacOSX you have to install R and Rserve (see below!).

### Linux and MacOSX Rserve (compiled for cooperative mode) installation:

To install Rserve open the R shell and then execute the menu action “Options -> Install Rserve (coop. mode) for R …” for different R versions. This will download an install Rserve in your default R library location, see video below (please make sure that your default Linux R library install location has writing permissions!). In cooperative mode only one connection at a time is allowed (which we want for this Desktop appl.) and all subsequent connections share the same namespace (default on Windows)!

R packages which are useful in combination with Bio7 can easily be installed with the R-Shell context menu “Packages” action:

*R-Shell context menu->Packages->Install_Default_R_Packages*
