**Quantifying error contributions of computational steps, algorithms and hyperparameter choices in image classification pipelines**

Data science relies on pipelines that are organized in the form of interdependent computational steps. Each step consists of various candidate algorithms that maybe used for performing a particular function. Each algorithm consists of several hyperparameters. Algorithms and hyperparameters must be optimized as a whole to produce the best performance. Typical machine learning pipelines typically consist of complex algorithms in each of the steps. Not only is the selection process combinatorial, but it is also important to interpret and understand the pipelines. We propose a method to quantify the importance of different layers in the pipeline, by computing an error contribution relative to an agnostic choice of algorithms in that layer. We demonstrate our methodology on image classification pipelines. The agnostic methodology quantifies the error contributions from the computational steps, algorithms and hyperparameters in the image classification pipeline. We show that algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimization methods can be used to quantify the error contribution and that random search is able to quantify the contribution more accurately than Bayesian optimization. This methodology can be used by domain experts to understand machine learning and data analysis pipelines in terms of their individual components, which can help in prioritizing different components of the pipeline.

**A Grounded Interaction Protocol for Explainable Artificial Intelligence**

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems need to include an explanation model to communicate the internal decisions, behaviours and actions to the interacting humans. Successful explanation involves both cognitive and social processes. In this paper we focus on the challenge of meaningful interaction between an explainer and an explainee and investigate the structural aspects of an interactive explanation to propose an interaction protocol. We follow a bottom-up approach to derive the model by analysing transcripts of different explanation dialogue types with 398 explanation dialogues. We use grounded theory to code and identify key components of an explanation dialogue. We formalize the model using the agent dialogue framework (ADF) as a new dialogue type and then evaluate it in a human-agent interaction study with 101 dialogues from 14 participants. Our results show that the proposed model can closely follow the explanation dialogues of human-agent conversations.

**A Prediction Tournament Paradox**

In a prediction tournament, contestants ‘forecast’ by asserting a numerical probability for each of (say) 100 future real-world events. The scoring system is designed so that (regardless of the unknown true probabilities) more accurate forecasters will likely score better. This is true for one-on-one comparisons between contestants. But consider a realistic-size tournament with many contestants, with a range of accuracies. It may seem self-evident that the winner will likely be one of the most accurate forecasters. But, in the setting where the range extends to very accurate forecasters, simulations show this is mathematically false, within a somewhat plausible model. Even outside that setting the winner is less likely than intuition suggests to be one of the handful of best forecasters. Though implicit in recent technical papers, this paradox has apparently not been explicitly pointed out before, though is easily explained. It perhaps has implications for the ongoing IARPA-sponsored research programs involving forecasting.

**Implicit Regularization in Over-parameterized Neural Networks**

Over-parameterized neural networks generalize well in practice without any explicit regularization. Although it has not been proven yet, empirical evidence suggests that implicit regularization plays a crucial role in deep learning and prevents the network from overfitting. In this work, we introduce the gradient gap deviation and the gradient deflection as statistical measures corresponding to the network curvature and the Hessian matrix to analyze variations of network derivatives with respect to input parameters, and investigate how implicit regularization works in ReLU neural networks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our result reveals that the network output between each pair of input samples is properly controlled by random initialization and stochastic gradient descent to keep interpolating between samples almost straight, which results in low complexity of over-parameterized neural networks.

**PROPS: Probabilistic personalization of black-box sequence models**

**Payoff Dynamic Models and Evolutionary Dynamic Models: Feedback and Convergence to Equilibria**

We consider that at every instant each member of a population, which we refer to as an agent, selects one strategy out of a finite set. The agents are nondescript, and their strategy choices are described by the so-called population state vector, whose entries are the portions of the population selecting each strategy. Likewise, each entry constituting the so-called payoff vector is the reward attributed to a strategy. We consider that a general finite-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system, denoted as payoff dynamical model (PDM), describes a mechanism that determines the payoff as a causal map of the population state. A bounded-rationality protocol, inspired primarily on evolutionary biology principles, governs how each agent revises its strategy repeatedly based on complete or partial knowledge of the population state and payoff. The population is protocol-homogeneous but is otherwise strategy-heterogeneous considering that the agents are allowed to select distinct strategies concurrently. A stochastic mechanism determines the instants when agents revise their strategies, but we consider that the population is large enough that, with high probability, the population state can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy uniformly over any finite horizon by a so-called (deterministic) mean population state. We propose an approach that takes advantage of passivity principles to obtain sufficient conditions determining, for a given protocol and PDM, when the mean population state is guaranteed to converge to a meaningful set of equilibria, which could be either an appropriately defined extension of Nash’s for the PDM or a perturbed version of it. By generalizing and unifying previous work, our framework also provides a foundation for future work.

**Using Natural Language for Reward Shaping in Reinforcement Learning**

Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown strong performance in complex domains such as Atari games, but are often highly sample inefficient. A common approach to reduce interaction time with the environment is to use reward shaping, which involves carefully designing reward functions that provide the agent intermediate rewards for progress towards the goal. However, designing appropriate shaping rewards is known to be difficult as well as time-consuming. In this work, we address this problem by using natural language instructions to perform reward shaping. We propose the LanguagE-Action Reward Network (LEARN), a framework that maps free-form natural language instructions to intermediate rewards based on actions taken by the agent. These intermediate language-based rewards can seamlessly be integrated into any standard reinforcement learning algorithm. We experiment with Montezuma’s Revenge from the Atari Learning Environment, a popular benchmark in RL. Our experiments on a diverse set of 15 tasks demonstrate that, for the same number of interactions with the environment, language-based rewards lead to successful completion of the task 60% more often on average, compared to learning without language.

**Gaps in Information Access in Social Networks**

The study of influence maximization in social networks has largely ignored disparate effects these algorithms might have on the individuals contained in the social network. Individuals may place a high value on receiving information, e.g. job openings or advertisements for loans. While well-connected individuals at the center of the network are likely to receive the information that is being distributed through the network, poorly connected individuals are systematically less likely to receive the information, producing a gap in access to the information between individuals. In this work, we study how best to spread information in a social network while minimizing this access gap. We propose to use the maximin social welfare function as an objective function, where we maximize the minimum probability of receiving the information under an intervention. We prove that in this setting this welfare function constrains the access gap whereas maximizing the expected number of nodes reached does not. We also investigate the difficulties of using the maximin, and present hardness results and analysis for standard greedy strategies. Finally, we investigate practical ways of optimizing for the maximin, and give empirical evidence that a simple greedy-based strategy works well in practice.

**On the Quantization of Cellular Neural Networks for Cyber-Physical Systems**

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have been pervasive including smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, process control systems, robotics systems, and automatic pilot avionics. As usually implemented on embedded devices, CPS is typically constrained by computation capacity and energy consumption. In some CPS applications such as telemedicine and advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), data processing on the embedded devices is preferred due to security/safety and real-time requirement. Therefore, high efficiency is highly desirable for such CPS applications. In this paper we present CeNN quantization for high-efficient processing for CPS applications, particularly telemedicine and ADAS applications. We systematically put forward powers-of-two based incremental quantization of CeNNs for efficient hardware implementation. The incremental quantization contains iterative procedures including parameter partition, parameter quantization, and re-training. We propose five different strategies including random strategy, pruning inspired strategy, weighted pruning inspired strategy, nearest neighbor strategy, and weighted nearest neighbor strategy. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve a speedup up to 7.8x with no performance loss compared with the state-of-the-art FPGA solutions for CeNNs.

**Evaluation of Neural Network Uncertainty Estimation with Application to Resource-Constrained Platforms**

The ability to accurately estimate uncertainties in neural network predictions is of great importance in many critical tasks. In this paper, we first analyze the intrinsic relation between two main use cases of uncertainty estimation, i.e., selective prediction and confidence calibration. We then reveal the potential issues with the existing quality metrics for uncertainty estimation and propose new metrics to mitigate them. Finally, we apply these new metrics to resource-constrained platforms such as autonomous driver assistance systems where the quality of uncertainty estimation is critical. By exploring the trade-off between the model size and the estimation quality, a missing piece in the literature, some interesting trends are observed.

**Limitations of Pinned AUC for Measuring Unintended Bias**

This report examines the Pinned AUC metric introduced and highlights some of its limitations. Pinned AUC provides a threshold-agnostic measure of unintended bias in a classification model, inspired by the ROC-AUC metric. However, as we highlight in this report, there are ways that the metric can obscure different kinds of unintended biases when the underlying class distributions on which bias is being measured are not carefully controlled.

**Uncertainty-Aware Imitation Learning using Kernelized Movement Primitives**

During the past few years, probabilistic approaches to imitation learning have earned a relevant place in the literature. One of their most prominent features, in addition to extracting a mean trajectory from task demonstrations, is that they provide a variance estimation. The intuitive meaning of this variance, however, changes across different techniques, indicating either variability or uncertainty. In this paper we leverage kernelized movement primitives (KMP) to provide a new perspective on imitation learning by predicting variability, correlations and uncertainty about robot actions. This rich set of information is used in combination with optimal controller fusion to learn actions from data, with two main advantages: i) robots become safe when uncertain about their actions and ii) they are able to leverage partial demonstrations, given as elementary sub-tasks, to optimally perform a higher level, more complex task. We showcase our approach in a painting task, where a human user and a KUKA robot collaborate to paint a wooden board. The task is divided into two sub-tasks and we show that using our approach the robot becomes compliant (hence safe) outside the training regions and executes the two sub-tasks with optimal gains.

**Economic variable selection**

Regression plays a key role in many research areas and its variable selection is a classic and major problem. This study emphasizes cost of predictors to be purchased for future use, when we select a subset of them. Its economic aspect is naturally formalized by the decision-theoretic approach. In addition, two Bayesian approaches are proposed to address uncertainty about model parameters and models: the restricted and extended approaches, which lead us to rethink about model averaging. From objective, rule-based, or robust Bayes point of view, the former is preferred. Proposed method is applied to three popular datasets for illustration.

**Exploring Mixed Integer Programming Reformulations for Virtual Machine Placement with Disk Anti-Colocation Constraints**

One of the important problems for datacenter resource management is to place virtual machines (VMs) to physical machines (PMs) such that certain cost, profit or performance objective is optimized, subject to various constraints. In this paper, we consider an interesting and difficult VM placement problem with disk anti-colocation constraints: a VM’s virtual disks should be spread out across the physical disks of its assigned PM. For solutions, we use the mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations and algorithms. However, a challenge is the potentially long computation time of the MIP algorithms. In this paper, we explore how reformulation of the problem can help to reduce the computation time. We develop two reformulations, by redefining the variables, for our VM placement problem and evaluate the computation time of all three formulations. We show that they have vastly different computation time. All three formulations can be useful, but for different problem instances. They all should be kept in the toolbox for tackling the problem. Out of the three, formulation COMB is especially flexible and versatile, and it can solve large problem instances.

**Coupled CycleGAN: Unsupervised Hashing Network for Cross-Modal Retrieval**

In recent years, hashing has attracted more and more attention owing to its superior capacity of low storage cost and high query efficiency in large-scale cross-modal retrieval. Benefiting from deep leaning, continuously compelling results in cross-modal retrieval community have been achieved. However, existing deep cross-modal hashing methods either rely on amounts of labeled information or have no ability to learn an accuracy correlation between different modalities. In this paper, we proposed Unsupervised coupled Cycle generative adversarial Hashing networks (UCH), for cross-modal retrieval, where outer-cycle network is used to learn powerful common representation, and inner-cycle network is explained to generate reliable hash codes. Specifically, our proposed UCH seamlessly couples these two networks with generative adversarial mechanism, which can be optimized simultaneously to learn representation and hash codes. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets show that the proposed UCH outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods.

**Persona-Aware Tips Generation**

Tips, as a compacted and concise form of reviews, were paid less attention by researchers. In this paper, we investigate the task of tips generation by considering the `persona’ information which captures the intrinsic language style of the users or the different characteristics of the product items. In order to exploit the persona information, we propose a framework based on adversarial variational auto-encoders (aVAE) for persona modeling from the historical tips and reviews of users and items. The latent variables from aVAE are regarded as persona embeddings. Besides representing persona using the latent embeddings, we design a persona memory for storing the persona related words for users and items. Pointer Network is used to retrieve persona wordings from the memory when generating tips. Moreover, the persona embeddings are used as latent factors by a rating prediction component to predict the sentiment of a user over an item. Finally, the persona embeddings and the sentiment information are incorporated into a recurrent neural networks based tips generation component. Extensive experimental results are reported and discussed to elaborate the peculiarities of our framework.

**Representative Task Self-selection for Flexible Clustered Lifelong Learning**

Consider the lifelong learning paradigm whose objective is to learn a sequence of tasks depending on previous experiences, e.g., knowledge library or deep network weights. However, the knowledge libraries or deep networks for most recent lifelong learning models are with prescribed size, and can degenerate the performance for both learned tasks and coming ones when facing with a new task environment (cluster). To address this challenge, we propose a novel incremental clustered lifelong learning framework with two knowledge libraries: feature learning library and model knowledge library, called Flexible Clustered Lifelong Learning (FCL3). Specifically, the feature learning library modeled by an autoencoder architecture maintains a set of representation common across all the observed tasks, and the model knowledge library can be self-selected by identifying and adding new representative models (clusters). When a new task arrives, our proposed FCL3 model firstly transfers knowledge from these libraries to encode the new task, i.e., effectively and selectively soft-assigning this new task to multiple representative models over feature learning library. Then, 1) the new task with a higher outlier probability will then be judged as a new representative, and used to redefine both feature learning library and representative models over time; or 2) the new task with lower outlier probability will only refine the feature learning library. For model optimization, we cast this lifelong learning problem as an alternating direction minimization problem as a new task comes. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework by analyzing several multi-task datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our FCL3 model can achieve better performance than most lifelong learning frameworks, even batch clustered multi-task learning models.

**Graph Neural Networks for User Identity Linkage**

The increasing popularity and diversity of social media sites has encouraged more and more people to participate in multiple online social networks to enjoy their services. Each user may create a user identity to represent his or her unique public figure in every social network. User identity linkage across online social networks is an emerging task and has attracted increasing attention, which could potentially impact various domains such as recommendations and link predictions. The majority of existing work focuses on mining network proximity or user profile data for discovering user identity linkages. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), it provides great potential to advance user identity linkage since users are connected in social graphs, and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, predicting user identity linkages based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user social graphs encode both \textit{local} structure such as users’ neighborhood signals, and \textit{global} structure with community properties. To address these challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework ({\m}) for user identity linkage. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture local and global information in the user-user social graph and propose the framework {\m}, which jointly learning user representations for user identity linkage. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

**Bidirectional Attentive Memory Networks for Question Answering over Knowledge Bases**

When answering natural language questions over knowledge bases (KB), different question components and KB aspects play different roles. However, most existing embedding-based methods for knowledge base question answering (KBQA) ignore the subtle inter-relationships between the question and the KB (e.g., entity types, relation paths and context). In this work, we propose to directly model the two-way flow of interactions between the questions and the underlying KB via a novel two-layered bidirectional attention network, called BAMnet. Without requiring any external resources or hand-crafted features, on the WebQuestions benchmark, our method significantly outperforms existing information-retrieval based methods, and remains competitive with (hand-crafted) semantic parsing based methods. Also, since we use attention mechanisms, our method offers better interpretability compared to other baselines.

**Deep Transfer Learning for Multiple Class Novelty Detection**

We propose a transfer learning-based solution for the problem of multiple class novelty detection. In particular, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning based approach in which we investigate how the knowledge contained in an external, out-of-distributional dataset can be used to improve the performance of a deep network for visual novelty detection. Our solution differs from the standard deep classification networks on two accounts. First, we use a novel loss function, membership loss, in addition to the classical cross-entropy loss for training networks. Secondly, we use the knowledge from the external dataset more effectively to learn globally negative filters, filters that respond to generic objects outside the known class set. We show that thresholding the maximal activation of the proposed network can be used to identify novel objects effectively. Extensive experiments on four publicly available novelty detection datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

**Transfer feature generating networks with semantic classes structure for zero-shot learning**

Suffering from the generating feature inconsistence of seen classes training model for following the distribution of unseen classes , most of existing feature generating networks difficultly obtain satisfactory performance for the challenging generalization zero-shot learning (GZSL) by adversarial learning the distribution of semantic classes. To alleviate the negative influence of this inconsistence for zero-shot learning (ZSL), transfer feature generating networks with semantic classes structure (TFGNSCS) is proposed to construct networks model for improving the performance of ZSL and GZSL. TFGNSCS can not only consider the semantic structure relationship between seen and unseen classes but also learn the difference of generating features by balancing transfer information between seen and unseen classes in networks. The proposed method can integrate a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with classification loss and transfer loss to generate enough CNN feature, on which softmax classifiers are trained for ZSL and GZSL. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of TFGNSCS outperforms that of the state of the arts on four challenging datasets, which are CUB,FLO,SUN, AWA in GZSL.

**Training in Task Space to Speed Up and Guide Reinforcement Learning**

**Positively Scale-Invariant Flatness of ReLU Neural Networks**

It was empirically confirmed by Keskar et al.\cite{SharpMinima} that flatter minima generalize better. However, for the popular ReLU network, sharp minimum can also generalize well \cite{SharpMinimacan}. The conclusion demonstrates that the existing definitions of flatness fail to account for the complex geometry of ReLU neural networks because they can’t cover the Positively Scale-Invariant (PSI) property of ReLU network. In this paper, we formalize the PSI causes problem of existing definitions of flatness and propose a new description of flatness – \emph{PSI-flatness}. PSI-flatness is defined on the values of basis paths \cite{GSGD} instead of weights. Values of basis paths have been shown to be the PSI-variables and can sufficiently represent the ReLU neural networks which ensure the PSI property of PSI-flatness. Then we study the relation between PSI-flatness and generalization theoretically and empirically. First, we formulate a generalization bound based on PSI-flatness which shows generalization error decreasing with the ratio between the largest basis path value and the smallest basis path value. That is to say, the minimum with balanced values of basis paths will more likely to be flatter and generalize better. Finally. we visualize the PSI-flatness of loss surface around two learned models which indicates the minimum with smaller PSI-flatness can indeed generalize better.

**Visual Discourse Parsing**

Text-level discourse parsing aims to unmask how two segments (or sentences) in the text are related to each other. We propose the task of Visual Discourse Parsing, which requires understanding discourse relations among scenes in a video. Here we use the term scene to refer to a subset of video frames that can better summarize the video. In order to collect a dataset for learning discourse cues from videos, one needs to manually identify the scenes from a large pool of video frames and then annotate the discourse relations between them. This is clearly a time consuming, expensive and tedious task. In this work, we propose an approach to identify discourse cues from the videos without the need to explicitly identify and annotate the scenes. We also present a novel dataset containing 310 videos and the corresponding discourse cues to evaluate our approach. We believe that many of the multi-discipline Artificial Intelligence problems such as Visual Dialog and Visual Storytelling would greatly benefit from the use of visual discourse cues.

**MIND: Model Independent Neural Decoder**

Standard decoding approaches rely on model-based channel estimation methods to compensate for varying channel effects, which degrade in performance whenever there is a model mismatch. Recently proposed Deep learning based neural decoders address this problem by leveraging a model-free approach via gradient-based training. However, they require large amounts of data to retrain to achieve the desired adaptivity, which becomes intractable in practical systems. In this paper, we propose a new decoder: Model Independent Neural Decoder (MIND), which builds on the top of neural decoders and equips them with a fast adaptation capability to varying channels. This feature is achieved via the methodology of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Here the decoder: (a) learns a ‘good’ parameter initialization in the meta-training stage where the model is exposed to a set of archetypal channels and (b) updates the parameter with respect to the observed channel in the meta-testing phase using minimal adaptation data and pilot bits. Building on top of existing state-of-the-art neural Convolutional and Turbo decoders, MIND outperforms the static benchmarks by a large margin and shows minimal performance gap when compared to the neural (Convolutional or Turbo) decoders designed for that particular channel. In addition, MIND also shows strong learning capability for channels not exposed during the meta training phase.

**Bayesian techniques and applications to QCD**

Realizing the full potential of interconnecting the large amounts of data created in physics experiments, phenomenological models and theory simulations requires robust tools for statistical inference. Here I review a particularly promising branch, Bayesian statistics, which over the past decade has found manifold use in high-energy physics. After a brief introduction to Bayesian statistics I will present two concrete examples, where Bayesian thinking has led to progress in understanding strongly interacting matter: unfolding problems in the form of lattice QCD spectral functions (in spirit similar to detector corrections), as well as the efficient estimation of quark-gluon-plasma parameters from a systematic comparison of experimental heavy-ion collision data and phenomenological models.

**Learning from Higher-Layer Feature Visualizations**

Driven by the goal to enable sleep apnea monitoring and machine learning-based detection at home with small mobile devices, we investigate whether interpretation-based indirect knowledge transfer can be used to create classifiers with acceptable performance. Interpretation-based indirect knowledge transfer means that a classifier (student) learns from a synthetic dataset based on the knowledge representation from an already trained Deep Network (teacher). We use activation maximization to generate visualizations and create a synthetic dataset to train the student classifier. This approach has the advantage that student classifiers can be trained without access to the original training data. With experiments we investigate the feasibility of interpretation-based indirect knowledge transfer and its limitations. The student achieves an accuracy of 97.8% on MNIST (teacher accuracy: 99.3%) with a similar smaller architecture to that of the teacher. The student classifier achieves an accuracy of 86.1% and 89.5% for a subset of the Apnea-ECG dataset (teacher: 89.5% and 91.1%, respectively).

**Neural Empirical Bayes**

We formulate a novel framework that unifies kernel density estimation and empirical Bayes, where we address a broad set of problems in unsupervised learning with a geometric interpretation rooted in the concentration of measure phenomenon. We start by energy estimation based on a denoising objective which recovers the original/clean data X from its measured/noisy version Y with empirical Bayes least squares estimator. The setup is rooted in kernel density estimation, but the log-pdf in Y is parametrized with a neural network, and crucially, the learning objective is derived for any level of noise/kernel bandwidth. Learning is efficient with double backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. An elegant physical picture emerges of an interacting system of high-dimensional spheres around each data point, together with a globally-defined probability flow field. The picture is powerful: it leads to a novel sampling algorithm, a new notion of associative memory, and it is instrumental in designing experiments. We start with extreme denoising experiments. Walk-jump sampling is defined by Langevin MCMC walks in Y, along with asynchronous empirical Bayes jumps to X. Robbins associative memory is defined by a deterministic flow to attractors of the learned probability flow field. Finally, we observed the emergence of remarkably rich creative modes in the regime of highly overlapping spheres.

**Understanding the Artificial Intelligence Clinician and optimal treatment strategies for sepsis in intensive care**

In this document, we explore in more detail our published work (Komorowski, Celi, Badawi, Gordon, & Faisal, 2018) for the benefit of the AI in Healthcare research community. In the above paper, we developed the AI Clinician system, which demonstrated how reinforcement learning could be used to make useful recommendations towards optimal treatment decisions from intensive care data. Since publication a number of authors have reviewed our work (e.g. Abbasi, 2018; Bos, Azoulay, & Martin-Loeches, 2019; Saria, 2018). Given the difference of our framework to previous work, the fact that we are bridging two very different academic communities (intensive care and machine learning) and that our work has impact on a number of other areas with more traditional computer-based approaches (biosignal processing and control, biomedical engineering), we are providing here additional details on our recent publication.

**Compressing complex convolutional neural network based on an improved deep compression algorithm**

Although convolutional neural network (CNN) has made great progress, large redundant parameters restrict its deployment on embedded devices, especially mobile devices. The recent compression works are focused on real-value convolutional neural network (Real CNN), however, to our knowledge, there is no attempt for the compression of complex-value convolutional neural network (Complex CNN). Compared with the real-valued network, the complex-value neural network is easier to optimize, generalize, and has better learning potential. This paper extends the commonly used deep compression algorithm from real domain to complex domain and proposes an improved deep compression algorithm for the compression of Complex CNN. The proposed algorithm compresses the network about 8 times on CIFAR-10 dataset with less than 3% accuracy loss. On the ImageNet dataset, our method compresses the model about 16 times and the accuracy loss is about 2% without retraining.

**Detecting Overfitting via Adversarial Examples**

The repeated reuse of test sets in popular benchmark problems raises doubts about the credibility of reported test error rates. Verifying whether a learned model is overfitted to a test set is challenging as independent test sets drawn from the same data distribution are usually unavailable, while other test sets may introduce a distribution shift. We propose a new hypothesis test that uses only the original test data to detect overfitting. It utilizes a new unbiased error estimate that is based on adversarial examples generated from the test data and importance weighting. Overfitting is detected if this error estimate is sufficiently different from the original test error rate. The power of the method is illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations on a synthetic problem. We develop a specialized variant of our dependence detector for multiclass image classification, and apply it to testing overfitting of recent models to two popular real-world image classification benchmarks. In the case of ImageNet, our method was not able to detect overfitting to the test set for a state-of-the-art classifier, while on CIFAR-10 we found strong evidence of overfitting for the two recent model architectures we considered, and weak evidence of overfitting on the level of individual training runs.

**Explaining Anomalies Detected by Autoencoders Using SHAP**

Anomaly detection algorithms are often thought to be limited because they don’t facilitate the process of validating results performed by domain experts. In Contrast, deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection, such as autoencoders, point out the outliers, saving experts the time-consuming task of examining normal cases in order to find anomalies. Most outlier detection algorithms output a score for each instance in the database. The top-k most intense outliers are returned to the user for further inspection; however the manual validation of results becomes challenging without additional clues. An explanation of why an instance is anomalous enables the experts to focus their investigation on most important anomalies and may increase their trust in the algorithm. Recently, a game theory-based framework known as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) has been shown to be effective in explaining various supervised learning models. In this research, we extend SHAP to explain anomalies detected by an autoencoder, an unsupervised model. The proposed method extracts and visually depicts both the features that most contributed to the anomaly and those that offset it. A preliminary experimental study using real world data demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed method in assisting the domain experts to understand the anomaly and filtering out the uninteresting anomalies, aiming at minimizing the false positive rate of detected anomalies.

**SpykeTorch: Efficient Simulation of Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks with at most one Spike per Neuron**

Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or Multi-GPU platforms.

**Orthogonal Structure Search for Efficient Causal Discovery from Observational Data**

The problem of inferring the direct causal parents of a response variable among a large set of explanatory variables is of high practical importance in many disciplines. Recent work exploits stability of regression coefficients or invariance properties of models across different experimental conditions for reconstructing the full causal graph. These approaches generally do not scale well with the number of the explanatory variables and are difficult to extend to nonlinear relationships. Contrary to existing work, we propose an approach which even works for observational data alone, while still offering theoretical guarantees including the case of partially nonlinear relationships. Our algorithm requires only one estimation for each variable and in our experiments we apply our causal discovery algorithm even to large graphs, demonstrating significant improvements compared to well established approaches.

**LF-PPL: A Low-Level First Order Probabilistic Programming Language for Non-Differentiable Models**

We develop a new Low-level, First-order Probabilistic Programming Language (LF-PPL) suited for models containing a mix of continuous, discrete, and/or piecewise-continuous variables. The key success of this language and its compilation scheme is in its ability to automatically distinguish parameters the density function is discontinuous with respect to, while further providing runtime checks for boundary crossings. This enables the introduction of new inference engines that are able to exploit gradient information, while remaining efficient for models which are not everywhere differentiable. We demonstrate this ability by incorporating a discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DHMC) inference engine that is able to deliver automated and efficient inference for non-differentiable models. Our system is backed up by a mathematical formalism that ensures that any model expressed in this language has a density with measure zero discontinuities to maintain the validity of the inference engine.

**GQ-STN: Optimizing One-Shot Grasp Detection based on Robustness Classifier**

Grasping is a fundamental robotic task needed for the deployment of household robots or furthering warehouse automation. However, few approaches are able to perform grasp detection in real time (frame rate). To this effect, we present Grasp Quality Spatial Transformer Network (GQ-STN), a one-shot grasp detection network. Being based on the Spatial Transformer Network (STN), it produces not only a grasp configuration, but also directly outputs a depth image centered at this configuration. By connecting our architecture to an externally-trained grasp robustness evaluation network, we can train efficiently to satisfy a robustness metric via the backpropagation of the gradient emanating from the evaluation network. This removes the difficulty of training detection networks on sparsely annotated databases, a common issue in grasping. We further propose to use this robustness classifier to compare approaches, being more reliable than the traditional rectangle metric. Our GQ-STN is able to detect robust grasps on the depth images of the Dex-Net 2.0 dataset with 92.4 % accuracy in a single pass of the network. We finally demonstrate in a physical benchmark that our method can propose robust grasps more often than previous sampling-based methods, while being more than 60 times faster.

**Understanding and Visualizing Deep Visual Saliency Models**

Recently, data-driven deep saliency models have achieved high performance and have outperformed classical saliency models, as demonstrated by results on datasets such as the MIT300 and SALICON. Yet, there remains a large gap between the performance of these models and the inter-human baseline. Some outstanding questions include what have these models learned, how and where they fail, and how they can be improved. This article attempts to answer these questions by analyzing the representations learned by individual neurons located at the intermediate layers of deep saliency models. To this end, we follow the steps of existing deep saliency models, that is borrowing a pre-trained model of object recognition to encode the visual features and learning a decoder to infer the saliency. We consider two cases when the encoder is used as a fixed feature extractor and when it is fine-tuned, and compare the inner representations of the network. To study how the learned representations depend on the task, we fine-tune the same network using the same image set but for two different tasks: saliency prediction versus scene classification. Our analyses reveal that: 1) some visual regions (e.g. head, text, symbol, vehicle) are already encoded within various layers of the network pre-trained for object recognition, 2) using modern datasets, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained models for saliency prediction makes them favor some categories (e.g. head) over some others (e.g. text), 3) although deep models of saliency outperform classical models on natural images, the converse is true for synthetic stimuli (e.g. pop-out search arrays), an evidence of significant difference between human and data-driven saliency models, and 4) we confirm that, after-fine tuning, the change in inner-representations is mostly due to the task and not the domain shift in the data.

**Threshold Selection in Univariate Extreme Value Analysis**

Threshold selection plays a key role for various aspects of statistical inference of rare events. Most classical approaches tackling this problem for heavy-tailed distributions crucially depend on tuning parameters or critical values to be chosen by the practitioner. To simplify the use of automated, data-driven threshold selection methods, we introduce two new procedures not requiring the manual choice of any parameters. The first method measures the deviation of the log-spacings from the exponential distribution and achieves good performance in simulations for estimating high quantiles. The second approach smoothly estimates the asymptotic mean square error of the Hill estimator and performs consistently well over a wide range of distributions. The methods are compared to existing procedures in an extensive simulation study and applied to a dataset of financial losses, where the underlying extreme value index is assumed to vary over time. This application strongly emphasizes the importance of solid automated threshold selection.

**Safety-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning via Online Gaussian Process Estimation**

An important facet of reinforcement learning (RL) has to do with how the agent goes about exploring the environment. Traditional exploration strategies typically focus on efficiency and ignore safety. However, for practical applications, ensuring safety of the agent during exploration is crucial since performing an unsafe action or reaching an unsafe state could result in irreversible damage to the agent. The main challenge of safe exploration is that characterizing the unsafe states and actions is difficult for large continuous state or action spaces and unknown environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to incorporate estimations of safety to guide exploration and policy search in deep reinforcement learning. By using a cost function to capture trajectory-based safety, our key idea is to formulate the state-action value function of this safety cost as a candidate Lyapunov function and extend control-theoretic results to approximate its derivative using online Gaussian Process (GP) estimation. We show how to use these statistical models to guide the agent in unknown environments to obtain high-performance control policies with provable stability certificates.
