I promised the audience at the RVATech Summit yesterday that I’d post the updated slides for my “Can a Machine be Racist or Sexist?” talk, so here they are!

Here is the link to the previous post, which has a pdf version of the slides that’s almost identical, and a video from when I gave this talk at Tom Tom Fest Applied Machine Learning Conference in 2018.

Here’s the blog post that was the start of researching this topic, for me.

Here’s the twitter list of people who talk about Ethics & Law in AI/ML.

And here’s the flipboard magazine where I collect articles on this topic.

Enjoy!
