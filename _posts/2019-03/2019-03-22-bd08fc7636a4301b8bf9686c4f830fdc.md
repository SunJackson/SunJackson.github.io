 Mode is the data science platform that helps you get data in every corner of your business and create a single source of truth.

 



**Free your data science team**Data scientists spend lots of time answering follow-up questions that require small tweaks to existing work. Mode's interactive features, from filters and parameters to drilldowns, let stakeholders answer their own questionsâ€”leaving analysts more time for other valuable work.



 



**Automate everything**Every Mode report lives at a unique URL for sharing, iterating, and building upon. Get vital data to business leaders, where and when they want to see it, with scheduled email and Slack deliveries. Or, use the Mode API to set up alerts, run or edit queries, and programatically manage your organization.



 



**Create a single source of truth**Mode Business is designed to help you build a data culture that teams across your business can trust. Features like version control, advanced permissions, and Definitions (reusable company-wide SQL logic) make it easy to audit and govern your data.
