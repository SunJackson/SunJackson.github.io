[Festival Chatter (Part 2) - Evaluating Band Popularity from Bonnaroo Tweets](http://blog.ethanrosenthal.com/2014/09/09/festival-chatter-part2)


In my previous [post](http://blog.ethanrosenthal.com/2014/08/31/festival-chatter-part1), I wrote about how I collected tweets about the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival during the entirety of the festival. There are a wide range of questions that could be answered by this dataset, like

- Do people spell worse as they become more intoxicated throughout the night?

- Does text [sentiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) decline as people go more days without bathing?

- Who in the world tweets from a laptop during a music festival?


I would honestly love to answer the above questions (and plan to), but I will focus on the most obvious question for this post:

**Which band was most [popular](http://youtu.be/RNc45FTenhg)?**

And while this question seems simple to answer, there are many reasons this blog post is so long. To start, we do not even have a decent definition of the question!

What does it mean for an artist to be the most popular as measured by tweets? For now, let's work off of the oldest rule of PR: "Any publicity is good publicity". In that case, we shall rank band popularity simply by the number of tweets that mention each artist. Let's try to do this and see what happens.

## Of Pythons and Pandas

From the previous post, I have my dataset of Bonnaroo tweets sitting in a MongoDB database. I would like to get these tweets out of the database and into [IPython](http://ipython.org/), a software package for interactive computing in Python. I exported the database as a giant JSON file and then loaded it into IPython with a list comprehension.

The next step is to get the JSON record into [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a Python library used mainly for manipulating tabular data. The main object for dealing with tabular data, the DataFrame, nicely reads in such a JSON record.

If I type `df.count()` I see that, sure enough, all 157,600 tweets are present and that 8,656 of them contain location data.

While watching the tweets stream in, I noticed that there are a lot of retweets. To me, these do not seem as "organic" as a bona-fide, original tweet. People and software can spam twitter all they want with retweets, but it is more difficult to spam with original tweets. So, I think a more robust measure of band popularity is *unique* tweets. Pandas allows us to easily investigate this:

Of the 157,600 original tweets, only about two-thirds of them are unique tweets. And wait, what's that most popular tweet that is repeated 1,938 times?

Wow. Sure enough, if you go to the twitter page for [@502michael502](https://twitter.com/502michael502), you will see that random pro-Islam messages are tweeted and retweeted thousands of times with an assorted collection of hashtags containing trending and religious words. I guess Bonnaroo was popular enough to make it onto @502michael502's trending hashtags! And here I thought he was just a big jam band fan.

Ok, now we can try to remove retweets. We start by grabbing only unique tweets.

There we go: we have gone from 157,600 total tweets to 93,311 "organic" tweets. There is still more work that we could do to get more organic tweets. For example, I would argue that news media sources tweeting about artists at Bonnaroo are not a good measure of band popularity. Such tweets are more difficult to detect, though. One method could be to look at the source of the tweet - maybe tweets from cell phones are more likely to be individuals than media organizations? I will save this for another post because we still have a lot of work to do!

## Most BeautifulSoup in the [Room](http://youtu.be/5YIxpNPhAQE)

Now that I have grouped together all of the tweets that we care to investigate, we must search for mentions of each Bonnaroo artist. But I am lazy. There are *189* different artists performing at Bonnaroo, and by no means do I feel like typing them all out.

Enter [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup), a Python library for scraping websites. All I have to do is check out the band lineup on the Bonnaroo website, figure out which `div` elements correspond to the listed bands, and *BeautifulSoup* will grab the contents.

## With a Little Help from my (API) Friends

When I wrote the above script, I thought I was done. Later on, I thought about the fact that people do not always call bands by their full name. For example, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are often abbreviated RHCP. I was amazed when I found that [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/), an online music encyclopedia, not only keeps track of bands' aliases and mispellings, but MusicBrainz actually has an API for accessing this information. Even better, somebody created a [Python wrapper](http://python-musicbrainzngs.readthedocs.org/en/latest) for the API.

I also had to perform some "scrubbing" of the aliases that are retrieved from the MusicBrainz API. I consider that a band is "mentioned" in a tweet if all words in any of the band's aliases are present in the tweet text. For example, a match for both "arctic" and "monkeys" in the text would be a mention of "Arctic Monkeys". However, I do not want to miss a mention of "The Flaming Lips" because "the" is not included.

I ameliorated this issue by using [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/), a Natural Language Processing library. The library contains a list of English stopwords (common words like "the") which I used as a filter. **Note**: This may be an issue for bands like "The Head and the Heart" where the filter would leave behind "head" and "heart". Both these words could easily be in a tweet and not relate to the band.

The code below shows how I used the public API's and *nltk* in order to get searchable aliases.

## The Final Histogram

Ok, so we now have a dictionary of *easily searchable* aliases for all artists that performed at Bonnaroo. All we have to do now is go through each tweet and see if any of the aliases for any of the artists are mentioned. We can then build a histogram of "mentions" for each artist by adding up all of the mentions in all of the tweets for a given artist.

In the code below, I do just this. By running the function at the bottom, `get_bandPop`, we get a *pandas* Series in return that contains each artist and the number of times they were mentioned in all of the tweets.

And now, finally, all we have to do is type `bandPop[:10].plot(kind='bar')` (and maybe fiddle around in *matplotlib* for an hour adjusting properties of the figure) and we get a histogram of mentions for the top ten most popular bands at Bonnaroo:

And of course it's Kanye! Is anybody surprised?

Wow, that was a lot of work for one, measly histogram! However, we now have a bunch of data analytical machinery that we can use to delve deeper into this dataset. In my [next post](http://blog.ethanrosenthal.com/2014/10/06/festival-chatter-part3), I'll do just that!
