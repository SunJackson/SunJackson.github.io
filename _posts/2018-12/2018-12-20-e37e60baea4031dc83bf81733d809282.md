R 3.5.2, the latest version of the R language for statistical computation and graphics from the R Foundation, was released today. (This release is codenamed "Eggshell Igloo", likely in reference to this or this *Peanuts* cartoon.) Compared to R 3.5.1, this update includes only bug fixes, so R scripts and packages compatible with R 3.5.0 or R 3.5.1 should work without modification.

Installers for R on Windows and Debian Linux are available now; other platforms should be available from CRAN within the next few days. If you want to see the full list of fixes, check out the announcement from the R Core Group at the link below.
