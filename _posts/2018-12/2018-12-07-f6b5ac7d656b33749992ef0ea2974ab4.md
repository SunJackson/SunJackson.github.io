Time really does fly. It’s been 5 months since Delhi NCR useR group had come into being and our first meetup. It was a successful event which included sessions featuring an R-core member and a veteran data scientist. More importantly, the 50+ community members who’d turned up took part in stimulating discussions and got to know about each other’s work. You can find videos from the session here.
