This is code that accompanies a book chapter on customer churn that I have written for the German dpunkt Verlag. The book is in German and will probably appear in February: https://www.dpunkt.de/buecher/13208/9783864906107-data-science.html.

The code you find below can be used to recreate all figures and analyses from this book chapter. Because the content is exclusively for the book, my descriptions around the code had to be minimal. But Iâ€™m sure, you can get the gist, even without the book. ğŸ˜‰

Thank you to the following people for providing excellent code examples about customer churn:

All analyses are done in R using RStudio. For detailed session information including R version, operating system and package versions, see the `sessionInfo()` output at the end of this document.

All figures are produced with ggplot2.
