**Kernel Regression With Sparse Metric Learning (KR-SML)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Kernel regression is a popular non-parametric fitting technique. It aims at learning a function which estimates the targets for test inputs as precise as possible. Generally, the function value for a test input is estimated by a weighted average of the surrounding training examples. The weights are typically computed by a distance-based kernel function and they strongly depend on the distances between examples. In this paper, we first review the latest developments of sparse metric learning and kernel regression. Then a novel kernel regression method involving sparse metric learning, which is called kernel regression with sparse metric learning (KR$\_$SML), is proposed. The sparse kernel regression model is established by enforcing a mixed $(2,1)$-norm regularization over the metric matrix. It learns a Mahalanobis distance metric by a gradient descent procedure, which can simultaneously conduct dimensionality reduction and lead to good prediction results. Our work is the first to combine kernel regression with sparse metric learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is evaluated on 19 data sets for regression. Furthermore, the new method is also applied to solving practical problems of forecasting short-term traffic flows. In the end, we compare the proposed method with other three related kernel regression methods on all test data sets under two criterions. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much more competitive. … 

**Provenance Unification through Graph (PUG)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Explaining why an answer is (or is not) returned by a query is important for many applications including auditing, debugging data and queries, and answering hypothetical questions about data. In this work, we present the first practical approach for answering such questions for queries with negation (first- order queries). Specifically, we introduce a graph-based provenance model that, while syntactic in nature, supports reverse reasoning and is proven to encode a wide range of provenance models from the literature. The implementation of this model in our PUG (Provenance Unification through Graphs) system takes a provenance question and Datalog query as an input and generates a Datalog program that computes an explanation, i.e., the part of the provenance that is relevant to answer the question. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a desirable factorization of provenance can be achieved by rewriting an input query. We experimentally evaluate our approach demonstrating its efficiency. … 

**Deep Hashing Neural Network (HNN)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper we propose a synergistic melting of neural networks and decision trees into a deep hashing neural network (HNN) having a modeling capability exponential with respect to its number of neurons. We first derive a soft decision tree named neural decision tree allowing the optimization of arbitrary decision function at each split node. We then rewrite this soft space partitioning as a new kind of neural network layer, namely the hashing layer (HL), which can be seen as a generalization of the known soft-max layer. This HL can easily replace the standard last layer of ANN in any known network topology and thus can be used after a convolutional or recurrent neural network for example. We present the modeling capacity of this deep hashing function on small datasets where one can reach at least equally good results as standard neural networks by diminishing the number of output neurons. Finally, we show that for the case where the number of output neurons is large, the neural network can mitigate the absence of linear decision boundaries by learning for each difficult class a collection of not necessarily connected sub-regions of the space leading to more flexible decision surfaces. Finally, the HNN can be seen as a deep locality sensitive hashing function which can be trained in a supervised or unsupervised setting as we will demonstrate for classification and regression problems. …
