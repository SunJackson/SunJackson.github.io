So, after having held workshops introducing Bayes for a couple of years now, I finally pulled myself together and completed my DataCamp course: Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R! ðŸ˜�

While itâ€™s called a course, itâ€™s more like a 4 hour workshop and â€” without requiring anything but basic R skills and a vague notion of probability â€” it introduces Bayesian data analysis from scratch. The whole course is done *online*, coding and all, using DataCampâ€™s interactive course interface (like Rstudio, but in the browser) and, while you need a DataCamp subscription to do the full course, you can *do the first part for free* by just signing into DataCamp! If you feel thatâ€™s too much of a commitment you have the first two videos in the course right here: 



Please try it out and let me know what you think! 

### Where to go after the course?

As always I recomend either of the following two excelent introductions to Bayesia data analysis:

My DataCamp course roughly covers chapters 1-3 in *Statistical Rethinking* so youâ€™ll already have a headstart on that one.
