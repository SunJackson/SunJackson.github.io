We try to keep this blog mostly technical and business (as we assume that is what our readers are here for).

However, this post is going to be an exception.

I’ve just got back from photographing the Rotary Club of San Francisco‘s 2018 Holiday Party. We had a special guest SF Mayor London Breed (shown here with Rotary Club of San Francisco President Rhonda Poppen).

I am proud to say I have been a member of this organization for over 10 years. It is where I do my volunteer work both in San Francisco and internationally.

In particular I am thrilled to be supporting the efforts of a number of Rotarians and Roots of Peace in their latest effort to remediate farmland in Vietnam (with the help and permission of the Vietnamese government). These people are working hard to undo some of the pain and misery of unexploded ordinance (UXO). I’ll be helping with some administrative tasks and these people will be training hundreds of farmers to move into profitable world market crops.
