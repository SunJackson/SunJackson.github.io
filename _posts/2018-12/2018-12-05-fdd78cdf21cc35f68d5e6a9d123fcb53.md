As of today, Kaggle is now officially integrated with Data Studio, Google’s serverless business intelligence and data visualization platform. You’ll be able to connect to and visualize Kaggle datasets directly from Data Studio using the Kaggle Community Connector.

Kaggle is the world's largest online community of data scientists. Its two million users come to the platform to explore, create, and share data projects using Kernels, a free hosted notebook IDE. Over 10,000 public datasets can be analyzed using Kernels, accessed via the web or Kaggle's public API. This new integration, users can analyze these datasets in Kaggle; and then visualize findings and publish their data stories using Data Studio.

Here’s an example dashboard in Data Studio using a Kaggle dataset:


As a free-to-use reporting solution, Data Studio makes it easier for users to understand their data, derive key insights, and effectively communicate findings using compelling interactive dashboards. Data Studio is creating an innovative landscape where users can spend less time building their data pipeline and more time on creating data stories and sharing them with the right audience.

With this integration, users can browse to a dataset in Kaggle, pick a file, and use the one-click integration button to launch Data Studio with the selected data. From there, users can create and publish their own interactive dashboard, which can be embedded in websites and blogs. Since there is no cost to use Data Studio and the infrastructure is handled by Google, users don't have to worry about scalability, even if millions of people view the dashboard.

Here’s a quick clip showing how easy it is to use this integration to build dashboards in Data Studio:

See Connecting Kaggle Datasets to Data Studio to learn more.

Data Studio helps data professionals bring the power of visual analytics to their data. The hassle-free publishing process means everyone can tell engaging stories, open up dashboards for others to interact with, and make better-informed decisions. We're also releasing the connector code for this integration in the Data Studio Open Source Repository. This should help both Data Studio developers and Kaggle users to build newer and better solutions.

To get started, try out a Kaggle maintained dataset and launch the Kaggle connector for Data Studio. Let’s analyze more data and build awesome dashboards!
