Yet another boring barplot?No!I’ve asked my students from MiNI WUT to visualize some data about their favorite movies or series.Results are pretty awesome.Believe me or not, but charts in these posters are created with ggplot2 (most of them)!

**Star Wars**

Fan of StaR WaRs? Find out which color is the most popular for lightsabers!Yes, these lightsabers are created with ggplot2.Would you guess which characters are overweighed?Find the R code and the data on the GitHub.

**Harry Pixel**

Take fames from Harry Potter movies, use k-means to extract dominant colors for each frame, calculate derivative for color changes and here you are.The R code and the poster are here.(steep derivatives in color space is a nice proxy for dynamic scenes).

**Social Network for Super Heroes**

Have you ever wondered how the distribution of super powers looks like among Avengers?Check put this poster or dive in the data.

**Pardon my French, but…**

Scrap transcripts from over 100k movies, find out how many curse words you may find in these movies, plot these statistics.Here are sources and the poster.(Bonus Question 1: how curse words are related to Obama/Trump presidency?Bonus Question 2: is the number of hard curse words increasing or not?)

**Rick and Morty**

Interested in the demography of characters from Rick and Morty?Here is the R code and the poster.(Tricky question: what is happening with season 3?)

**Twin Peaks**

Transcripts from Twin Peaks are full of references to coffee and donuts.Except the episode in which the Laura’s murdered is revealed (ups, spoiler alert).Check out this by yourself with these scripts.

**The Lion King**

Which Disney’s movie is the most popular?It wasn’t hard to guess.

Next time I will ask my students to visualize data about R packages…Or maybe you have some other ideas?
