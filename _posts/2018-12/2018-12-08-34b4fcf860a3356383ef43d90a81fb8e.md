**Interpretable Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Inference on Noisy Knowledge Graphs**

In this work, we provide a new formulation for Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) for link prediction on graph data that addresses common challenges for biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs). We introduce a regularized attention mechanism to GCNNs that not only improves performance on clean datasets, but also favorably accommodates noise in KGs, a pervasive issue in real-world applications. Further, we explore new visualization methods for interpretable modelling and to illustrate how the learned representation can be exploited to automate dataset denoising. The results are demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, the common benchmark dataset FB15k-237, and a large biomedical knowledge graph derived from a combination of noisy and clean data sources. Using these improvements, we visualize a learned model’s representation of the disease cystic fibrosis and demonstrate how to interrogate a neural network to show the potential of PPARG as a candidate therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis.

**Learning Curriculum Policies for Reinforcement Learning**

Curriculum learning in reinforcement learning is a training methodology that seeks to speed up learning of a difficult target task, by first training on a series of simpler tasks and transferring the knowledge acquired to the target task. Automatically choosing a sequence of such tasks (i.e. a curriculum) is an open problem that has been the subject of much recent work in this area. In this paper, we build upon a recent method for curriculum design, which formulates the curriculum sequencing problem as a Markov Decision Process. We extend this model to handle multiple transfer learning algorithms, and show for the first time that a curriculum policy over this MDP can be learned from experience. We explore various representations that make this possible, and evaluate our approach by learning curriculum policies for multiple agents in two different domains. The results show that our method produces curricula that can train agents to perform on a target task as fast or faster than existing methods.

**On variation of gradients of deep neural networks**

We provide a theoretical explanation of the role of the number of nodes at each layer in deep neural networks. We prove that the largest variation of a deep neural network with ReLU activation function arises when the layer with the fewest nodes changes its activation pattern. An important implication is that deep neural network is a useful tool to generate functions most of whose variations are concentrated on a smaller area of the input space near the boundaries corresponding to the layer with the fewest nodes. In turn, this property makes the function more invariant to input transformation. That is, our theoretical result gives a clue about how to design the architecture of a deep neural network to increase complexity and transformation invariancy simultaneously.

**Fake News: A Survey of Research, Detection Methods, and Opportunities**

The explosive growth in fake news and its erosion to democracy, justice, and public trust has increased the demand for fake news analysis, detection and intervention. This survey comprehensively and systematically reviews fake news research. The survey identifies and specifies fundamental theories across various disciplines, e.g., psychology and social science, to facilitate and enhance the interdisciplinary research of fake news. Current fake news research is reviewed, summarized and evaluated. These studies focus on fake news from four perspective: (1) the false knowledge it carries, (2) its writing style, (3) its propagation patterns, and (4) the credibility of its creators and spreaders. We characterize each perspective with various analyzable and utilizable information provided by news and its spreaders, various strategies and frameworks that are adaptable, and techniques that are applicable. By reviewing the characteristics of fake news and open issues in fake news studies, we highlight some potential research tasks at the end of this survey.

**Image Score: How to Select Useful Samples**

There has long been debates on how we could interpret neural networks and understand the decisions our models make. Specifically, why deep neural networks tend to be error-prone when dealing with samples that output low softmax scores. We present an efficient approach to measure the confidence of decision-making steps by statistically investigating each unit’s contribution to that decision. Instead of focusing on how the models react on datasets, we study the datasets themselves given a pre-trained model. Our approach is capable of assigning a score to each sample within a dataset that measures the frequency of occurrence of that sample’s chain of activation. We demonstrate with experiments that our method could select useful samples to improve deep neural networks in a semi-supervised leaning setting.

**Network Compression via Recursive Bayesian Pruning**

Recently, compression and acceleration of deep neural networks are in critic need. Bayesian generalization of structured pruning represents an important research direction to solve the above problem. However, the existing Bayesian methods ignore the dependency among neurons and filters for computational simplicity. In this study, we explore, under Bayesian framework, a structured pruning method with layer-wise sequential dependency assumed, a more general learning setting. Based on the property of Dirac distribution, we further derive a new dropout noise, which makes it possible to approximate the posterior of dropout noise knowing that of the previous layer. With the Dirac-like dropout noise, we further propose a recursive strategy, named \emph{Recursive Bayesian Pruning} (RBP), to train and prune networks in a layer-by-layer fashion. The unimportant neurons and filters are directly targeted and removed, taking the influence from the previous layer. Experiments on typical neural networks LeNet-300-100, LeNet-5 and VGG-16 have demonstrated the proposed method are competitive with or even outperform the state-of-the-art methods in several compression and acceleration metrics.

**Feature Selection Based on Unique Relevant Information for Health Data**

Feature selection, which searches for the most representative features in observed data, is critical for health data analysis. Unlike feature extraction, such as PCA and autoencoder based methods, feature selection preserves interpretability, meaning that the selected features provide direct information about certain health conditions (i.e., the label). Thus, feature selection allows domain experts, such as clinicians, to understand the predictions made by machine learning based systems, as well as improve their own diagnostic skills. Mutual information is often used as a basis for feature selection since it measures dependencies between features and labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel mutual information based feature selection (MIBFS) method called SURI, which boosts features with high unique relevant information. We compare SURI to existing MIBFS methods using 3 different classifiers on 6 publicly available healthcare data sets. The results indicate that, in addition to preserving interpretability, SURI selects more relevant feature subsets which lead to higher classification performance. More importantly, we explore the dynamics of mutual information on a public low-dimensional health data set via exhaustive search. The results suggest the important role of unique relevant information in feature selection and verify the principles behind SURI.

**Efficient Lifelong Learning with A-GEM**

In lifelong learning, the learner is presented with a sequence of tasks, incrementally building a data-driven prior which may be leveraged to speed up learning of a new task. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of current lifelong approaches, in terms of sample complexity, computational and memory cost. Towards this end, we first introduce a new and a more realistic evaluation protocol, whereby learners observe each example only once and hyper-parameter selection is done on a small and disjoint set of tasks, which is not used for the actual learning experience and evaluation. Second, we introduce a new metric measuring how quickly a learner acquires a new skill. Third, we propose an improved version of GEM (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017), dubbed Averaged GEM (A-GEM), which enjoys the same or even better performance as GEM, while being almost as computationally and memory efficient as EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016) and other regularization-based methods. Finally, we show that all algorithms including A-GEM can learn even more quickly if they are provided with task descriptors specifying the classification tasks under consideration. Our experiments on several standard lifelong learning benchmarks demonstrate that A-GEM has the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

**Towards a More Practice-Aware Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms**

Theory of evolutionary computation (EC) aims at providing mathematically founded statements about the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The predominant topic in this research domain is runtime analysis, which studies the time it takes a given EA to solve a given optimization problem. Runtime analysis has witnessed significant advances in the last couple of years, allowing us to compute precise runtime estimates for several EAs and several problems. Runtime analysis is, however (and unfortunately!), often judged by practitioners to be of little relevance for real applications of EAs. Several reasons for this claim exist. We address two of them in this present work: (1) EA implementations often differ from their vanilla pseudocode description, which, in turn, typically form the basis for runtime analysis. To close the resulting gap between empirically observed and theoretically derived performance estimates, we therefore suggest to take this discrepancy into account in the mathematical analysis and to adjust, for example, the cost assigned to the evaluation of search points that equal one of their direct parents (provided that this is easy to verify as is the case in almost all standard EAs). (2) Most runtime analysis results make statements about the expected time to reach an optimal solution (and possibly the distribution of this optimization time) only, thus explicitly or implicitly neglecting the importance of understanding how the function values evolve over time. We suggest to extend runtime statements to runtime profiles, covering the expected time needed to reach points of intermediate fitness values. As a direct consequence, we obtain a result showing that the greedy (2+1) GA of Sudholt [GECCO 2012] outperforms any unary unbiased black-box algorithm on OneMax.

**Generalization in anti-causal learning**

The ability to learn and act in novel situations is still a prerogative of animate intelligence, as current machine learning methods mostly fail when moving beyond the standard i.i.d. setting. What is the reason for this discrepancy? Most machine learning tasks are anti-causal, i.e., we infer causes (labels) from effects (observations). Typically, in supervised learning we build systems that try to directly invert causal mechanisms. Instead, in this paper we argue that strong generalization capabilities crucially hinge on searching and validating meaningful hypotheses, requiring access to a causal model. In such a framework, we want to find a cause that leads to the observed effect. Anti-causal models are used to drive this search, but a causal model is required for validation. We investigate the fundamental differences between causal and anti-causal tasks, discuss implications for topics ranging from adversarial attacks to disentangling factors of variation, and provide extensive evidence from the literature to substantiate our view. We advocate for incorporating causal models in supervised learning to shift the paradigm from inference only, to search and validation.

**Modeling Irregularly Sampled Clinical Time Series**

While the volume of electronic health records (EHR) data continues to grow, it remains rare for hospital systems to capture dense physiological data streams, even in the data-rich intensive care unit setting. Instead, typical EHR records consist of sparse and irregularly observed multivariate time series, which are well understood to present particularly challenging problems for machine learning methods. In this paper, we present a new deep learning architecture for addressing this problem based on the use of a semi-parametric interpolation network followed by the application of a prediction network. The interpolation network allows for information to be shared across multiple dimensions during the interpolation stage, while any standard deep learning model can be used for the prediction network. We investigate the performance of this architecture on the problems of mortality and length of stay prediction.
