“Be the Google of Your Organization: Everybody understands that data is key to Google’s dominance. Companies across every industry are trying to establish themselves as the owners and users of the best data available. Watching this data gold rush, it can be easy to forget about the opportunities much closer to home. Within your company, some people are using data to create and advocate effective strategic arguments. How do you ensure that you are a Google within your company, instead of an Alta Vista?” Matt Ritter ( January 5, 2016 )
