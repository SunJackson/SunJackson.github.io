The countdown to year's end is on, and we've begun collecting expert opinions on 2018's main developments and 2019's key trend predictions. We also share a great set of deep learning cheat sheets, a collection of the best tools, languages, and frameworks, see how to build a machine learning team when you aren't a tech giant, and get schooled on how to choose the best machine learning course. Enjoy!
