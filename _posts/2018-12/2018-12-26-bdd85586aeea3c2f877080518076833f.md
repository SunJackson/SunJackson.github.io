**Task Embedded Coordinate Update (TECU)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We in this paper propose a realizable framework TECU, which embeds task-specific strategies into update schemes of coordinate descent, for optimizing multivariate non-convex problems with coupled objective functions. On one hand, TECU is capable of improving algorithm efficiencies through embedding productive numerical algorithms, for optimizing univariate sub-problems with nice properties. From the other side, it also augments probabilities to receive desired results, by embedding advanced techniques in optimizations of realistic tasks. Integrating both numerical algorithms and advanced techniques together, TECU is proposed in a unified framework for solving a class of non-convex problems. Although the task embedded strategies bring inaccuracies in sub-problem optimizations, we provide a realizable criterion to control the errors, meanwhile, to ensure robust performances with rigid theoretical analyses. By respectively embedding ADMM and a residual-type CNN in our algorithm framework, the experimental results verify both efficiency and effectiveness of embedding task-oriented strategies in coordinate descent for solving practical problems. … 

**SlimNet** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Deep neural networks have achieved increasingly accurate results on a wide variety of complex tasks. However, much of this improvement is due to the growing use and availability of computational resources (e.g use of GPUs, more layers, more parameters, etc). Most state-of-the-art deep networks, despite performing well, over-parameterize approximate functions and take a significant amount of time to train. With increased focus on deploying deep neural networks on resource constrained devices like smart phones, there has been a push to evaluate why these models are so resource hungry and how they can be made more efficient. This work evaluates and compares three distinct methods for deep model compression and acceleration: weight pruning, low rank factorization, and knowledge distillation. Comparisons on VGG nets trained on CIFAR10 show that each of the models on their own are effective, but that the true power lies in combining them. We show that by combining pruning and knowledge distillation methods we can create a compressed network 85 times smaller than the original, all while retaining 96% of the original model’s accuracy. … 

**Channel Gating Neural Network** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Employing deep neural networks to obtain state-of-the-art performance on computer vision tasks can consume billions of floating point operations and several Joules of energy per evaluation. Network pruning, which statically removes unnecessary features and weights, has emerged as a promising way to reduce this computation cost. In this paper, we propose channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, training-based computation-cost-reduction scheme. Channel gating works by identifying the regions in the features which contribute less to the classification result and turning off a subset of the channels for computing the pixels within these uninteresting regions. Unlike static network pruning, the channel gating optimizes computations exploiting characteristics specific to each input at run-time. We show experimentally that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks can achieve 66% and 60% reduction in FLOPs with 0.22% and 0.29% accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively. …
