**Twin Sort Technique** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The objective behind the Twin Sort technique is to sort the list of unordered data elements efficiently and to allow efficient and simple arrangement of data elements within the data structure with optimization of comparisons and iterations in the sorting method. This sorting technique effectively terminates the iterations when there is no need of comparison if the elements are all sorted in between the iterations. Unlike Quick sort, Merge sorting technique, this new sorting technique is based on the iterative method of sorting elements within the data structure. So it will be advantageous for optimization of iterations when there is no need for sorting elements. Finally, the Twin Sort technique is more efficient and simple method of arranging elements within a data structure and it is easy to implement when comparing to the other sorting technique. By the introduction of optimization of comparison and iterations, it will never allow the arranging task on the ordered elements. … 

**Model Average Double Robust (MA-DR)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Estimates average treatment effects using model average double robust (MA-DR) estimation. The MA-DR estimator is defined as weighted average of double robust estimators, where each double robust estimator corresponds to a specific choice of the outcome model and the propensity score model. The MA-DR estimator extend the desirable double robustness property by achieving consistency under the much weaker assumption that either the true propensity score model or the true outcome model be within a specified, possibly large, class of models. … 

**Universal Planning Network (UPN)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A key challenge in complex visuomotor control is learning abstract representations that are effective for specifying goals, planning, and generalization. To this end, we introduce universal planning networks (UPN). UPNs embed differentiable planning within a goal-directed policy. This planning computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal action plan through gradient descent trajectory optimization. The plan-by-gradient-descent process and its underlying representations are learned end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed visual imitation via gradient-based trajectory optimization, but can also provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more effective learning when solving new tasks described via image-based goals. We were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies across robots with significantly different morphologies and actuation capabilities. …
