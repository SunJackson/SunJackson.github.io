**Apache Hadoop** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storage and large-scale processing of data-sets on clusters of commodity hardware. Hadoop is an Apache top-level project being built and used by a global community of contributors and users. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.<BR/>The Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules:<BR/>· Hadoop Common – contains libraries and utilities needed by other Hadoop modules<BR/>· Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) – a distributed file-system that stores data on commodity machines, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.<BR/>· Hadoop YARN – a resource-management platform responsible for managing compute resources in clusters and using them for scheduling of users’ applications.<BR/>· Hadoop MapReduce – a programming model for large scale data processing.<BR/>Hadoop is being regarded as one of the best platforms for storing and managing big data. It owes its success to its high data storage and processing scalability, low price/performance ratio, high performance, high availability, high schema flexibility, and its capability to handle all types of data. … 

**DOPING** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Recently, the introduction of the generative adversarial network (GAN) and its variants has enabled the generation of realistic synthetic samples, which has been used for enlarging training sets. Previous work primarily focused on data augmentation for semi-supervised and supervised tasks. In this paper, we instead focus on unsupervised anomaly detection and propose a novel generative data augmentation framework optimized for this task. In particular, we propose to oversample infrequent normal samples – normal samples that occur with small probability, e.g., rare normal events. We show that these samples are responsible for false positives in anomaly detection. However, oversampling of infrequent normal samples is challenging for real-world high-dimensional data with multimodal distributions. To address this challenge, we propose to use a GAN variant known as the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to transform the high-dimensional multimodal data distributions into low-dimensional unimodal latent distributions with well-defined tail probability. Then, we systematically oversample at the `edge’ of the latent distributions to increase the density of infrequent normal samples. We show that our oversampling pipeline is a unified one: it is generally applicable to datasets with different complex data distributions. … 

**LOKI** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Imitation learning (IL) consists of a set of tools that leverage expert demonstrations to quickly learn policies. However, if the expert is suboptimal, IL can yield policies with inferior performance compared to reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we aim to provide an algorithm that combines the best aspects of RL and IL. We accomplish this by formulating several popular RL and IL algorithms in a common mirror descent framework, showing that these algorithms can be viewed as a variation on a single approach. We then propose LOKI, a strategy for policy learning that first performs a small but random number of IL iterations before switching to a policy gradient RL method. We show that if the switching time is properly randomized, LOKI can learn to outperform a suboptimal expert and converge faster than running policy gradient from scratch. Finally, we evaluate the performance of LOKI experimentally in several simulated environments. …
