**Compositional GAN** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce images of surprising complexity and realism, but are generally modeled to sample from a single latent source ignoring the explicit spatial interaction between multiple entities that could be present in a scene. Capturing such complex interactions between different objects in the world, including their relative scaling, spatial layout, occlusion, or viewpoint transformation is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose to model object composition in a GAN framework as a self-consistent composition-decomposition network. Our model is conditioned on the object images from their marginal distributions to generate a realistic image from their joint distribution by explicitly learning the possible interactions. We evaluate our model through qualitative experiments and user evaluations in both the scenarios when either paired or unpaired examples for the individual object images and the joint scenes are given during training. Our results reveal that the learned model captures potential interactions between the two object domains given as input to output new instances of composed scene at test time in a reasonable fashion. … 

**Polypus** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper we propose a new parallel architecture based on Big Data technologies for real-time sentiment analysis on microblogging posts. Polypus is a modular framework that provides the following functionalities: (1) massive text extraction from Twitter, (2) distributed non-relational storage optimized for time range queries, (3) memory-based intermodule buffering, (4) real-time sentiment classification, (5) near real-time keyword sentiment aggregation in time series, (6) a HTTP API to interact with the Polypus cluster and (7) a web interface to analyze results visually. The whole architecture is self-deployable and based on Docker containers. … 

**Generalized Dynamic Principal Components (GDPC)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Brillinger defined dynamic principal components (DPC) for time series based on a reconstruction criterion. He gave a very elegant theoretical solution and proposed an estimator which is consistent under stationarity. Here, we propose a new enterally empirical approach to DPC. The main differences with the existing methods-mainly Brillinger procedure-are (1) the DPC we propose need not be a linear combination of the observations and (2) it can be based on a variety of loss functions including robust ones. Unlike Brillinger, we do not establish any consistency results; however, contrary to Brillinger’s, which has a very strong stationarity flavor, our concept aims at a better adaptation to possible nonstationary features of the series. We also present a robust version of our procedure that allows to estimate the DPC when the series have outlier contamination. We give iterative algorithms to compute the proposed procedures that can be used with a large number of variables. Our nonrobust and robust procedures are illustrated with real datasets. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)
