Tableau has chart type called “Packed Bubble Chart”, while I haven’t really utilized packed bubble chart much, I always thought they are fun and beautiful. I wanted to try creating same chart using R, and I came across package called packcircles.

Reading vignettes was really helpful to figure out how to use the package!!– introduction vignettes – Progressive packing vignettes to get started on using this package.

Just few more of these…

Good image to use is square image with above, but it’s fun turning into logo & images!!!

Below are just few more things I’ve experimented with circle packing technique…
