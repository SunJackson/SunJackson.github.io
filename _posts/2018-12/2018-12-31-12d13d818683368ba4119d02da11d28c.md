We seek a highly talented scientist/engineer to join our collegial and diverse multidisciplinary team. Our goal is to transform medical ultrasound diagnosis through work that spans hardware and algorithm development focused on image reconstruction and analysis, all with an integrated clinical translational component. This is a unique opportunity to be part of a highly energetic group working to translate research into clinical care.

The successful candidate will be expected to proactively develop his/her research interests and to work effectively with others toward shared goals. Candidates who seek creative academic careers will have excellent growth opportunities, access to committed mentors, assistance with defining an early career trajectory, and mentored opportunities to apply for career development and research grants. There will be opportunities for co-supervision and mentorship from MIT and Harvard scientists working in close collaboration with CURT physicians and scientists.

Work collaboratively with a highly motivated and collegial team of physicians, clinical researchers, computer scientists, and engineers to solve important medical problems in a world-class research facility.
Have access to a vast amount of high-quality medical imaging and pathologic data, advanced computing facilities, a friendly environment, and an unparalleled community of basic and clinical scientists.
Gain a deep understanding of key problems in medical imaging.
Gain knowledge and understanding of important disease processes, including cancer, fibrosis, and inflammation.

**Requirements:**

The ideal candidate will have a PhD in Applied Mathematics, Computational Statistics, Computer Science, Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related discipline.
Strong communication skills in written and verbal English are required.
Proficiency in one or more programming language, especially C++, MATLAB, Python, or R, is required.
Experience with machine learning is required, experience with Linux and image analysis skills are desirable.
