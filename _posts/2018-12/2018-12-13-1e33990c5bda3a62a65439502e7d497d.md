- **Approach A**:​ 5 categorical variables and 7 numerical variables. This led to addition of 7*5=35 variables which gave a new dataset of 35+12=47 features.
- **Approach B**:  9 categorical variables and 3 numerical variables. This led to addition of 9*3=27 variables which gave a new dataset of 27+12=39 features.
- **Approach C**: 5 categorical variables and 4 numerical variables. This led to additionof 5*4=20 variables which gave a new dataset of 20+12=32 features



**Model Building:**

The final model was an ensemble of 29 models consisting of:

The optimum threshold was the one which was maximizing the f1 score for the CV predictions. 5 thresholds, 2 lower than the optimum threshold and 2 higher than the optimum threshold and the optimum threshold were chosen to give more robust predictions.

- 5 catboost models with 5 different thresholds on the raw dataset of 12 features.

- 5 catboost models with 5 different thresholds on the raw dataset of 39 features (Approach B)


- 4 xgboost models on Approach A

- 5 xgboost models on Approach B

- 5 lightgbm models on Approach C

- 5 lightgbm models on Approach A

## End Notes

The solutions shared above is a proof that the winners have put in great efforts and truly deserve the rewards for the same. They came up with some innovative solutions and had a well structured approach.

I hope you find these solutions useful and have learnt some key takeaways which you can implement in the upcoming hackathons! Register yourself in the upcoming hackathons at DataHack Platform.
