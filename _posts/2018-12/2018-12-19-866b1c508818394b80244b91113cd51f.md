### Statistics

#### 1. Name and explain few methods/techniques used in Statistics for analyzing the data?

Answer:

**Arithmetic Mean:**It is an important technique in statistics Arithmetic Mean can also be called an average. It is the number or the quantity obtained by summing two or more numbers/variables and then dividing the sum by the number of numbers/variables.

**Median**:Median is also a way of finding the average of a group of data points. It’s the middle number of a set of numbers. There are two possibilities, the data points can be an odd number group or it can be en even number group.If the group is odd, arrange the numbers in the group from smallest to largest. The median will be the one which is exactly sitting in the middle, with an equal number on either side of it. If the group is even, arrange the numbers in order and pick the two middle numbers and add them then divide by 2. It will be the median number of that set.

**Mode:**The mode is also one of the types for finding the average. A mode is a number, which occurs most frequently in a group of numbers. Some series might not have any mode; some might have two modes which is called bimodal series.

In the study of statistics, the three most common ‘averages’ in statistics are Mean, Median and Mode.

**Standard Deviation (Sigma):**Standard Deviation is a measure of how much your data is spread out in statistics.

**Regression:**Regression is an analysis in statistical modelling. It’s a statistical process for measuring the relationships among the variables; it determines the strength of the relationship between one variable and a series of other changing independent variables.

#### 2. Explain about statistics branches?

Answer:The two main branches of statistics are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

**Descriptive statistics**: Descriptive statistics summarizes the data from a sample using indexes such as mean or standard deviation.

**Descriptive Statistics**, methods include displaying, organizing and describing the data.

Inferential Statistics: Inferential Statistics draws the conclusions from data that are subject to random variation such as observation errors and sample variation.

#### 3. List all the other models work with statistics to analyze the data?

#### 6. What is a Sample in Statistics and list the sampling methods?

Answer:In a Statistical study, a Sample is nothing but a set of or a portion of collected or processed data from a statistical population by a structured and defined procedure and the elements within the sample are known as a sample point.

Below are the 4 sampling methods:

- Cluster Sampling: IN cluster sampling method the population will be divided into groups or clusters.

- Simple Random: This sampling method simply follows the pure random division.

- Stratified: In stratified sampling, the data will be divided into groups or strata.

- Systematical: Systematical sampling method picks every kth member of the population.


#### 7. What is P- value and explain it?

Answer:When we execute a hypothesis test in statistics, a p-value helps us in determine the significance of our results. These Hypothesis tests are nothing but to test the validity of a claim that is made about a population. A null hypothesis is a situation when the hypothesis and the specified population is with no significant difference due to sampling or experimental error.

#### 8. What is Data Science and what is the relationship between Data science and Statistics?

Answer:Data Science is simply data-driven science, also, it involves the interdisciplinary field of automated scientific methods, algorithms, systems, and process to extracts the insights and knowledge from data in any form, either structured or unstructured. Furthermore, It has similarities with data mining, both abstracts the useful information from data.

Data Sciences include Mathematical Statistics along with Computer science and Applications. Also by combing aspects of statistics, visualization, applied mathematics, computer science Data Science is turning the vast amount of data into insights and knowledge.

Similarly, Statistics is one of the main components of Data Science. Statistics is a branch of mathematics commerce with the collection, analysis, interpretation, organization, and presentation of data.

#### 9. What is correlation and covariance in statistics?

Answer:Covariance and Correlation are two mathematical concepts; these two approaches are widely used in statistics. Both Correlation and Covariance establish the relationship and also measure the dependency between two random variables. Though the work is similar between these two in mathematical terms, they are different from each other.

**Correlation**: Correlation is considered or described as the best technique for measuring and also for estimating the quantitative relationship between two variables. Correlation measures how strongly two variables are related.

**Covariance**: In covariance two items vary together and it’s a measure that indicates the extent to which two random variables change in cycle. It is a statistical term; it explains the systematic relation between a pair of random variables, wherein changes in one variable reciprocal by a corresponding change in another variable.

#### 3. What is a cost function?

Answer:A cost function is a measure of the accuracy of the neural network with respect to given training sample and expected output. It is a single value, nonvector as it gives the performance of the neural network as a whole. It can be calculated as below Mean Squared Error function:-MSE=1n∑i=0n(Y^i–Yi)²Where Y^ and desired value Y is what we want to minimize.

#### 4. What is a gradient descent?

Answer:Gradient descent is basically an optimization algorithm, which is used to learn the value of parameters that minimizes the cost function. Furthermore, It is an iterative algorithm which moves in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. We compute the gradient descent of the cost function for a given parameter and update the parameter by the below formula:-Θ:=Θ–αd∂ΘJ(Θ)Where Θ — is the parameter vector, α — learning rate, J(Θ) — is a cost function.

#### 5. What is a backpropagation?

Answer:Backpropagation is a training algorithm used for multilayer neural network. In this method, we move the error from an end of the network to all weights inside the network and thus allowing efficient computation of the gradient. It consists of several steps as follows:-

1. Forward propagation of training data in order to generate output.

1. Then using the target value and output value error derivative can be computed with respect to output activation.

1. Then we back propagate for computing derivative of error with respect to output activation on previous and continue this for all the hidden layers.

1. Using previously calculated derivatives for output and all hidden layers we calculate error derivatives with respect to weights.

1. And then we update the weights.


#### 6. Explain the following three variants of gradient descent: batch, stochastic and mini-batch?

Answer:Stochastic Gradient Descent: Here we use only single training example for calculation of gradient and update parameters.Batch Gradient Descent: Here we calculate the gradient for the whole dataset and perform the update at each iteration.Mini-batch Gradient Descent: It’s one of the most popular optimization algorithms. It’s a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent and here instead of single training example, mini-batch of samples is used.

#### 7. What are the benefits of mini-batch gradient descent?

Answer:Below are the benefits of mini-batch gradient descent•This is more efficient compared to stochastic gradient descent.•The generalization by finding the flat minima.•Mini-batches allows help to approximate the gradient of the entire training set which helps us to avoid local minima.

#### 8. What is data normalization and why do we need it?

Answer:Data normalization is used during backpropagation. The main motive behind data normalization is to reduce or eliminate data redundancy. Here we rescale values to fit into a specific range to achieve better convergence.

#### 9. What is weight initialization in neural networks?

Answer:Weight initialization is one of the very important steps. A bad weight initialization can prevent a network from learning but good weight initialization helps in giving a quicker convergence and a better overall error. Biases can be generally initialized to zero. The rule for setting the weights is to be close to zero without being too small.

#### 10. What is an auto-encoder?

Answer:An autoencoder is an autonomous Machine learning algorithm that uses backpropagation principle, where the target values are set to be equal to the inputs provided. Internally, it has a hidden layer that describes a code used to represent the input.Some Key Facts about the autoencoder are as follows:-

•It is an unsupervised ML algorithm similar to Principal Component Analysis•Minimizes the same objective function as Principal Component Analysis•It is a neural network•The neural network’s target output is its input

#### 11. Is it OK to connect from a Layer 4 output back to a Layer 2 input?

Answer:Yes, this can be done considering that layer 4 output is from previous time step like in RNN. Also, we need to assume that previous input batch is sometimes- correlated with the current batch.

#### 12. What is a Boltzmann Machine?

Answer:Boltzmann Machine is a method to optimize the solution of a problem. The work of the Boltzmann machine is basically to optimize the weights and the quantity for the given problem.Some important points about Boltzmann Machine −•It uses recurrent structure.•Consists of stochastic neurons, which consist one of the two possible states, either 1 or 0.•The neurons in this are either in adaptive (free state) or clamped (frozen state).•If we apply simulated annealing on discrete Hopfield network, then it would become Boltzmann Machine.

#### 13. What is the role of the activation function?

Answer:The activation function is a method to introduce non-linearity into the neural network helping it to learn more complex function. Furthermore, without which the neural network would be only able to learn linear function which is a linear combination of its input data.
