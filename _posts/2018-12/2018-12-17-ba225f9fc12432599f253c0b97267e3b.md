At Figure Eight, we're big believers in active learning. We think it holds the promise to better models trained on less data, reducing cost and time-to-production for machine learning practitioners. And it's just about to go mainstream.


In our new eBook, An Introduction to Active Learning, we cover the essentials including:


- The pros and cons of active learning as an approach

- The three major categories of active learning

- How your active learner should decide which rows need labeling

- How to tell if active learning is appropriate for your ML project
