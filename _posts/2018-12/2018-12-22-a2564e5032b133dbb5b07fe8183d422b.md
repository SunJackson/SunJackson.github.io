We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper functions within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 22th day of Christmas my true love gave to me…

## What can it do?

This little helper does the same thing as the *"Find in files"* search within RStudio. It returns a vector with all files in a given folder that contain the search pattern. In your daily workflow, you would usually use the shortcut key *SHIFT+CTRL+F*. With `get_files()` you can use this functionality within your scripts.

## Overview

To see all the other functions you can either check out our GitHub or you can read about them here.

Have a merry advent season!
