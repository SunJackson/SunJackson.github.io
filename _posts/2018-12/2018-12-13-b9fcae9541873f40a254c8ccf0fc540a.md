**Agnostic Disambiguation of Named Entities Using Linked Open Data (AGDISTIS)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
AGDISTIS is an Open Source Named Entity Disambiguation Framework able to link entities against every Linked Data Knowledge Base. The ongoing transition from the current Web of unstructured data to the Data Web yet requires scalable and accurate approaches for the extraction of structured data in RDF (Resource Description Framework). One of the key steps towards extracting RDF from natural-language corpora is the disambiguation of named entities. AGDISTIS combines the HITS algorithm with label expansion strategies and string similarity measures. Based on this combination, it can efficiently detect the correct URIs for a given set of named entities within an input text. Furthermore, AGDISTIS is agnostic of the underlying knowledge base. AGDISTIS has been evaluated on different datasets against state-of-the-art named entity disambiguation frameworks.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Deep Reinforcement One-shot Learning (DeROL)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In recent years there has been a sharp rise in networking applications, in which significant events need to be classified but only a few training instances are available. These are known as cases of one-shot learning. Examples include analyzing network traffic under zero-day attacks, and computer vision tasks by sensor networks deployed in the field. To handle this challenging task, organizations often use human analysts to classify events under high uncertainty. Existing algorithms use a threshold-based mechanism to decide whether to classify an object automatically or send it to an analyst for deeper inspection. However, this approach leads to a significant waste of resources since it does not take the practical temporal constraints of system resources into account. Our contribution is threefold. First, we develop a novel Deep Reinforcement One-shot Learning (DeROL) framework to address this challenge. The basic idea of the DeROL algorithm is to train a deep-Q network to obtain a policy which is oblivious to the unseen classes in the testing data. Then, in real-time, DeROL maps the current state of the one-shot learning process to operational actions based on the trained deep-Q network, to maximize the objective function. Second, we develop the first open-source software for practical artificially intelligent one-shot classification systems with limited resources for the benefit of researchers in related fields. Third, we present an extensive experimental study using the OMNIGLOT dataset for computer vision tasks and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for intrusion detection tasks that demonstrates the versatility and efficiency of the DeROL framework. … 

**Poisson Regression** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In statistics, Poisson regression is a form of regression analysis used to model count data and contingency tables. Poisson regression assumes the response variable Y has a Poisson distribution, and assumes the logarithm of its expected value can be modeled by a linear combination of unknown parameters. A Poisson regression model is sometimes known as a log-linear model, especially when used to model contingency tables. …
