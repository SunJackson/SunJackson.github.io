**Principal Parameterization** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Insightful visualization of multidimensional scalar fields, in particular parameter spaces, is key to many fields in computational science and engineering. We propose a principal component-based approach to visualize such fields that accurately reflects their sensitivity to input parameters. The method performs dimensionality reduction on the vast $L^2$ Hilbert space formed by all possible partial functions (i.e., those defined by fixing one or more input parameters to specific values), which are projected to low-dimensional parameterized manifolds such as 3D curves, surfaces, and ensembles thereof. Our mapping provides a direct geometrical and visual interpretation in terms of Sobol’s celebrated method for variance-based sensitivity analysis. We furthermore contribute a practical realization of the proposed method by means of tensor decomposition, which enables accurate yet interactive integration and multilinear principal component analysis of high-dimensional models. … 

**Computation Tree Logic** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Computation tree logic (CTL) is a branching-time logic, meaning that its model of time is a tree-like structure in which the future is not determined; there are different paths in the future, any one of which might be an actual path that is realized. It is used in formal verification of software or hardware artifacts, typically by software applications known as model checkers which determine if a given artifact possesses safety or liveness properties. For example, CTL can specify that when some initial condition is satisfied (e.g., all program variables are positive or no cars on a highway straddle two lanes), then all possible executions of a program avoid some undesirable condition (e.g., dividing a number by zero or two cars colliding on a highway). In this example, the safety property could be verified by a model checker that explores all possible transitions out of program states satisfying the initial condition and ensures that all such executions satisfy the property. Computation tree logic is in a class of temporal logics that includes linear temporal logic (LTL). Although there are properties expressible only in CTL and properties expressible only in LTL, all properties expressible in either logic can also be expressed in CTL*. … 

**Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We extend two general methods of moment estimators to panel vector autoregression models (PVAR) with p lags of endogenous variables, predetermined and strictly exogenous variables. This general PVAR model contains the first difference GMM estimator by Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) <doi:10.2307/1913103>, Arellano and Bond (1991) <doi:10.2307/2297968> and the system GMM estimator by Blundell and Bond (1998) <doi:10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8>. We also provide specification tests (Hansen overidentification test, lag selection criterion and stability test of the PVAR polynomial) and classical structural analysis for PVAR models such as orthogonal and generalized impulse response functions, bootstrapped confidence intervals for impulse response analysis and forecast error variance decompositions. …
