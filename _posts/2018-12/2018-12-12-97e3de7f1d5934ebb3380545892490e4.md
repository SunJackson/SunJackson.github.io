**Sequential Adaptive Nonlinear Modeling of Vector Time Series (SLANTS)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose a method for adaptive nonlinear sequential modeling of vector-time series data. Data is modeled as a nonlinear function of past values corrupted by noise, and the underlying non-linear function is assumed to be approximately expandable in a spline basis. We cast the modeling of data as finding a good fit representation in the linear span of multi-dimensional spline basis, and use a variant of l1-penalty regularization in order to reduce the dimensionality of representation. Using adaptive filtering techniques, we design our online algorithm to automatically tune the underlying parameters based on the minimization of the regularized sequential prediction error. We demonstrate the generality and flexibility of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Moreover, we analytically investigate the performance of our algorithm by obtaining both bounds of the prediction errors, and consistency results for variable selection. … 

**Artificial Stupidity** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
And artificial stupidity’s most valid usage relates to examples of the obvious faultiness of AI technologies and systems. Finally within the field of computer science, artificial stupidity has one other significant application: it refers to a technique of deliberately dumbing down computer programs in order to introduce errors in their responses.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Adversarial Graphical Model (AGM)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In many structured prediction problems, complex relationships between variables are compactly defined using graphical structures. The most prevalent graphical prediction methods—probabilistic graphical models and large margin methods—have their own distinct strengths but also possess significant drawbacks. Conditional random fields (CRFs) are Fisher consistent, but they do not permit integration of customized loss metrics into their learning process. Large-margin models, such as structured support vector machines (SSVMs), have the flexibility to incorporate customized loss metrics, but lack Fisher consistency guarantees. We present adversarial graphical models (AGM), a distributionally robust approach for constructing a predictor that performs robustly for a class of data distributions defined using a graphical structure. Our approach enjoys both the flexibility of incorporating customized loss metrics into its design as well as the statistical guarantee of Fisher consistency. We present exact learning and prediction algorithms for AGM with time complexity similar to existing graphical models and show the practical benefits of our approach with experiments. …
