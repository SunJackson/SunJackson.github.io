**After living for more than a year on GitHub, we are pleased to announce that the `{remedy}` package is now on CRAN.**

Have you ever been frustrated about having to manually add markdown tags to your Rmd? If you are an avid markdown user, no doubt you’ve been complaining about what should be an easy task: adding bold, creating lists, urls, italics…

Good news, we’ve got the cure! `{remedy}` is a package designed to facilitate writing markdown documents in RStudio. The idea is to provide a series of keyboard shortcuts that will make you more efficient with markdown.

In other words, this package brings to markdown a “word processor like” experience when it comes to formatting — that is to say that putting things in bold is now possible via a keyboard shortcut.

Here is a quick example:

### Available shorcuts

Here is a list of available shortcuts:

- `align_arrow` / `align_equal` align the assignment operators in the highlighted text. 

- `backtickr` takes a piece of text an put it between backticks.

- `boldr` / `italicsr` / `striker` put a piece of text in bold, italics, or strike. 

- `chunkr` / `chunknamer` / `chunkr_doc` / `chunkr_section` / `chunksplitr`, addins to deal with chunks.

- `footnoter` creates a footnote.

- `h1r`:`h6r` set selected text to headers (from H1 to H6). 

- `htmlcommentr` add comment tags.

- `imager` / `urlr` / `youtuber` take an url and set the appropriate html/markdown tags. 

- `latexr` add LaTeX tags.

- `listr` / `olistr` turn a series of lines into lists.

- `rightr` copies selected content to the right. 

- `tabler` generates a markdown table.

- `xaringanr` inserts a pull-left pull-right for `{xaringan}`.


## Setting up

###  Installing

You can install `{remedy}` from the CRAN or from GitHub:

```
# From CRAN
install.packages("remedy")
# From GitHub
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/remedy")

```

Note that once installed, you don’t need to launch the package to use the shortcuts.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Of course, the idea is not to select the text, go to your addins list, search for the good addin, and to do perform the transformation: you need to bind the content of `{remedy}` to keyboard shortcuts.

If ever you want to do that, you can do this manually through Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts.

You can also use the `{rsam}` package — either with the recommended shortcuts:

```
remedy::remedy_opts$get('hotkeys')
#> backtick bold chunk 
#> "Ctrl+Cmd+`" "Ctrl+Cmd+B" "Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+C" 
#> chunksplit chunkname footnote 
#> "Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C" "Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N" "Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+6" 
#> h1 h2 h3 
#> "Ctrl+Cmd+1" "Ctrl+Cmd+2" "Ctrl+Cmd+3" 
#> h4 h5 h6 
#> "Ctrl+Cmd+4" "Ctrl+Cmd+5" "Ctrl+Cmd+6" 
#> htmlcomment image italics 
#> "Ctrl+Alt+C" "Ctrl+Cmd+P" "Ctrl+Cmd+I" 
#> latex list right 
#> "Ctrl+Cmd+L" "Ctrl+Shift+Cmd+=" "Alt+Cmd+Right" 
#> strike table url 
#> "Ctrl+Cmd+S" "Ctrl+Cmd+T" "Ctrl+Cmd+U" 
#> xaringan youtube 
#> "Ctrl+Cmd+X" "Ctrl+Cmd+Y"

hotkeys <- remedy::remedy_opts$get("hotkeys")
rsam::set_shortcut(sprintf('remedy::%sr',names(hotkeys)), hotkeys)

```

or with your own shortcuts.
