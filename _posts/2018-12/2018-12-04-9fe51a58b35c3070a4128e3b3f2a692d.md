Our recent addition to the NLP R universe is called **R package ruimtehol** which is open sourced at https://github.com/bnosac/ruimtehol This R package is a wrapper around Starspace which provides a neural embedding model for doing the following on text:

- **Text classification**

- **Learning word, sentence or document level embeddings**

- **Finding sentence or document similarity**

- **Ranking web documents**

- **Content-based recommendation (e.g. recommend text/music based on the content)**

- **Collaborative filtering based recommendation (e.g. recommend text/music based on interest)**

- **Identification of entity relationships**

If you are an R user and are interested in NLP techniques. Feel free to test out the framework and provide feedback at https://github.com/bnosac/ruimtehol/issues. The package is not on CRAN yet, but can be installed easily with the command devtools::install_github(“bnosac/ruimtehol”, build_vignettes = TRUE).

Below is an example how the package can be used for multi-label classification on questions asked in Belgian parliament. Each question in parliament was labelled with several of one of the 1785 categories.

## Each question in parliament was labelled with more than 1 category. There are 1785 categories in this datasetdekamer$question_themes <- strsplit(dekamer$question_theme, " +\\| +")## Plain text of the question in parliamentdekamer$text <- strsplit(dekamer$question, "\\W")dekamer$text <- sapply(dekamer$text, FUN=function(x) paste(x, collapse = " "))dekamer$text <- tolower(dekamer$text)

The list of R packages regarding text mining with R provided by BNOSAC has been steadily growing. This is the list of R packages maintained by BNOSAC.

- udpipe: tokenisation, lemmatisation, parts of speech tagging, dependency parsing, morphological feature extraction, sentiment scoring, keyword extraction, NLP flows

- crfsuite: named entity recognition, text classification, chunking, sequence modelling

- textrank: text summarisation

- ruimtehol: text classification, word/sentence/document embeddings, document/label similarities, ranking documengs, content based recommendation, collaborative filtering-based recommendation
