We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper functions within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 15th day of Christmas my true love gave to me…

## What can it do?

This little helper returns a set of colors which we often use at STATWORX. So, if – like me – you cannot remeber each hex color code you need, this might help. Of course these are our colours, but you could rewrite it with your own palette. But the main benefactor is the plotting method – so you can see the color instead of only reading the hex code.

## How to use it?

To see which hex code corresponds to which colour and for what purpose to use it

```
sci_palette()

```

```
main_color accent_color_1 accent_color_2 accent_color_3 highlight black 
 "#013848" "#0085AF" "#00A378" "#09557F" "#FF8000" "#000000" 
 text grey_2 light_gray special 
 "#696969" "#D9D9D9" "#F8F8F8" "#C62F4B" 
attr(,"class")
[1] "sci"

```

As mentioned above, there is a `plot()` method which gives the following picture.

```
plot(sci_palette())

```
