We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper functions within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 4th day of Christmas my true love gave to me…

## What can it do?

This little helper splits a given string into smaller parts with a fixed length. But why? Well I needed this function whilst creating a plot with a long title. The text was too long for one line and instead of just cutting it or let it run over the edges, I wanted to separate it nicely.

## How to use it?

Given a long string like

```
long_title <- c("Contains the months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December")

```

We want to split it after `split = ","` with a maximum length of `char = 60`.

```
short_title <- evenstrings(long_title, split = ",", char = 60)

```

The function has two possible output formats, which can be chosen by setting `newlines = TRUE` or `FALSE`:

- one string with line separators `\n`

- a vector with each sub part.


 An other use case could be a message that is printed at the console with `cat()`:

```
cat(long_title)

```

```
Contains the months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December

```

```
cat(short_title)

```

```
Contains the months: January, February, March, April, May,
 June, July, August, September, October, November, December

```

## Code for plot example

```
p1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10),
 aes(x = x, y = y)) +
 geom_point() +
 ggtitle(long_title)

p2 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10),
 aes(x = x, y = y)) +
 geom_point() +
 ggtitle(short_title)

multiplot(p1, p2)

```
