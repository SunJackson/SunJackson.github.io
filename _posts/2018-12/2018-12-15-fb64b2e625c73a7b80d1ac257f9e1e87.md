Our linl package for writing LaTeX letter with (R)markdown had a fairly minor release today, following up on the previous release well over a year ago. This version just contains one change which Mark van der Loo provided a few months ago with a clean PR. As another user was just bitten the same issue when using an included letterhead – which was fixed but unreleased – we decided it was time for a release. So there it is.

linl makes it easy to write letters in markdown, with some extra bells and whistles thanks to some cleverness chiefly by Aaron.

Here is screenshot of the vignette showing the simple input for some moderately fancy output:

The NEWS entry follows:

> 
Changes in linl version 0.0.3 (2018-12-15)

- Correct LaTeX double loading of package `color` with different options (Mark van der Loo in #18 fixing #17).



Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a comparison to the previous release. More information is on the linl page. For questions or comments use the issue tracker off the GitHub repo.
