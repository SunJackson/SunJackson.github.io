We’re excited to announce that Amazon Transcribe now supports automatic speech recognition in three new languages: French, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese. These new languages expand upon the 5 languages already available in Amazon Transcribe: US English, US Spanish, Australian English, British English, and Canadian French.

Using the Amazon Transcribe API, you can analyze audio files stored in Amazon S3 and have the service return a text file of the transcribed speech. You can also send a live audio stream to Amazon Transcribe and receive a stream of transcripts in real time. Automatic transcription is proving to be an extremely useful tool for many developers, across many domains (such as subtitles for videos, contact center call analytics and compliance, court depositions, and generally improving accessibility to any application).

You can learn more about how to use transcription in contact centers (including Amazon Connect) from this recent re:Invent breakout session:


French, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese transcription is available at the same price, and in the same Regions, as other languages in Amazon Transcribe. You can try the new set of languages through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface, and the AWS SDKs.
