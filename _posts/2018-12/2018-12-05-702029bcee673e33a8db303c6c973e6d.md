Sometimes itâ€™s useful to be able to extract data from a published figure. If the figure isnâ€™t a vector based format (for which the numeric data is probably still in the file), itâ€™s possible to digitize the image with R, click the points and extract it that way. The digitize package is simple to use for this purposeâ€¦

If you save the top figure from here to a PNG called â€œFig2a_Kreners2015â€� in your working directory, you can digitize the three lines and replicate the figure (or do other stuff if you so wish) as follows

Easy huh? It just gets a bit laborious with many pointsâ€¦ ![](https://i0.wp.com/s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png?w=456&ssl=1)
