**Jump Process** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A jump process is a type of stochastic process that has discrete movements, called jumps, with random arrival times, rather than continuous movement, typically modelled as a simple or compound Poisson process. In finance, various stochastic models are used to model the price movements of financial instruments; for example the Black-Scholes model for pricing options assumes that the underlying instrument follows a traditional diffusion process, with continuous, random movements at all scales, no matter how small. John Carrington Cox and Stephen Ross:145-166 proposed that prices actually follow a ‘jump process’. Robert C. Merton extended this approach to a hybrid model known as jump diffusion, which states that the prices have large jumps interspersed with small continuous movements. … 

**Rotation Forest** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Rotation forest is an ensemble method where each base classifier (tree) is fit on the principal components of the variables of random partitions of the feature set. A method for generating classifier ensembles based on feature extraction. To create the training data for a base classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K is a parameter of the algorithm) and principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name ‘forest’. Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Using WEKA, we examined the rotation forest ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and compared it with bagging, AdaBoost, and random forest. The results were favorable to rotation forest and prompted an investigation into diversity-accuracy landscape of the ensemble models. Diversity-error diagrams revealed that rotation forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and random forest, and more diverse than these in bagging, sometimes more accurate as well.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Variational Mode Decomposition (VMP)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
During the late 1990s, Huang introduced the algorithm called Empirical Mode Decomposition, which is widely used today to recursively decompose a signal into different modes of unknown but separate spectral bands. EMD is known for limitations like sensitivity to noise and sampling. These limitations could only partially be addressed by more mathematical attempts to this decomposition problem, like synchrosqueezing, empirical wavelets or recursive variational decomposition. Here, we propose an entirely non-recursive variational mode decomposition model, where the modes are extracted concurrently. The model looks for an ensemble of modes and their respective center frequencies, such that the modes collectively reproduce the input signal, while each being smooth after demodulation into baseband. In Fourier domain, this corresponds to a narrow-band prior. We show important relations to Wiener filter denoising. Indeed, the proposed method is a generalization of the classic Wiener filter into multiple, adaptive bands. Our model provides a solution to the decomposition problem that is theoretically well founded and still easy to understand. The variational model is efficiently optimized using an alternating direction method of multipliers approach. Preliminary results show attractive performance with respect to existing mode decomposition models. In particular, our proposed model is much more robust to sampling and noise. Finally, we show promising practical decomposition results on a series of artificial and real data. …
