So. I just graded the final exams for our applied regression class. Lots of students made mistakes which gave me the feeling that I didn’t teach the material so well. So I thought it could help lots of people out there if I were to share the questions, solutions, and common errors.

It was an in-class exam with 15 questions. I’ll post the questions and solutions, one at a time, for the first half of June, following the model of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys from a few years ago. Enjoy.
