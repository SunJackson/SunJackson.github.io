We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper functions within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 11th day of Christmas my true love gave to meâ€¦

## What can it do?

This little helper removes leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. With R version 3.5.1 `trimws` was introduced, which does the exact same thing. This just shows, it was not a bad idea to write such a function. ðŸ˜‰

## How to use it?

```
x <- c(" Hello world!", " Hello world! ", "Hello world! ")
trim(x, lead = TRUE, trail = TRUE)

```

```
[1] "Hello world!" "Hello world!" "Hello world!"

```

The `lead` and `trail` parameters indicates if only leading, trailing or both whitspaces should be removed.

## Overview

To see all the other functions you can either check out our GitHub or you can read about them here.

Have a merry advent season!
