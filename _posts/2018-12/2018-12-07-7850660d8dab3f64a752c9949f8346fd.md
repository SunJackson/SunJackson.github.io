**Single Shot Multibox Detetor (SSD)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

**Multi-Scale Deep Neural Network (MSDNN)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Salient object detection is a fundamental problem and has been received a great deal of attentions in computer vision. Recently deep learning model became a powerful tool for image feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale deep neural network (MSDNN) for salient object detection. The proposed model first extracts global high-level features and context information over the whole source image with recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN). Then several stacked deconvolutional layers are adopted to get the multi-scale feature representation and obtain a series of saliency maps. Finally, we investigate a fusion convolution module (FCM) to build a final pixel level saliency map. The proposed model is extensively evaluated on four salient object detection benchmark datasets. Results show that our deep model significantly outperforms other 12 state-of-the-art approaches. … 

**Modeling Higher Order Network Effects (MOHONE)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Many knowledge graph embedding methods operate on triples and are therefore implicitly limited by a very local view of the entire knowledge graph. We present a new framework MOHONE to effectively model higher order network effects in knowledge-graphs, thus enabling one to capture varying degrees of network connectivity (from the local to the global). Our framework is generic, explicitly models the network scale, and captures two different aspects of similarity in networks: (a) shared local neighborhood and (b) structural role-based similarity. First, we introduce methods that learn network representations of entities in the knowledge graph capturing these varied aspects of similarity. We then propose a fast, efficient method to incorporate the information captured by these network representations into existing knowledge graph embeddings. We show that our method consistently and significantly improves the performance on link prediction of several different knowledge-graph embedding methods including TRANSE, TRANSD, DISTMULT, and COMPLEX(by at least 4 points or 17% in some cases). …
