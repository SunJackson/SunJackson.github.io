We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper functions within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 17th day of Christmas my true love gave to me…

## What can it do?

This little helper is just a convenience function. Some times during your data preparation, you have a vector with infinite values like `Inf` or `-Inf` or even `NaN` values. Thos kind of value can (they do not have to!) mess up your evaluation and models. But most functions do have a tendency to handle missing values. So, this little helper removes such values and replaces them with `NA`.

## How to use it?

A small exampe to give you the idea:

```
test <- list(a = c("a", "b", NA),
 b = c(NaN, 1,2, -Inf),
 c = c(TRUE, FALSE, NaN, Inf))

lapply(test, to_na)

```

```
$a
[1] "a" "b" NA 

$b
[1] NA 1 2 NA

$c
[1] TRUE FALSE NA

```

**A little advice along the way!** Since there are different types of `NA` depending on the other values within a vector. You might want to check the format if you do `to_na` on groups or subsets.

```
test <- list(NA, c(NA, "a"), c(NA, 2.3), c(NA, 1L))
str(test)

```

```
List of 4
 $ : logi NA
 $ : chr [1:2] NA "a"
 $ : num [1:2] NA 2.3
 $ : int [1:2] NA 1

```

Have a merry advent season!
