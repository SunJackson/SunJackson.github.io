The Beta-Binomial model is the â€œhello worldâ€� of Bayesian statistics. That is, itâ€™s the first model you get to run, often before you even know what you are doing. There are many reasons for this: 

- It only has one parameter, the underlying proportion of success, so itâ€™s easy to visualize and reason about.

- Itâ€™s easy to come up with a scenario where it can be used, for example: â€œWhat is the proportion of patients that will be cured by this drug?â€�

- The model can be computed analytically (no need for any messy MCMC).

- Itâ€™s relatively easy to come up with an informative prior for the underlying proportion.

- Most importantly: Itâ€™s fun to see some results before diving into the theory! ğŸ˜�


Thatâ€™s why I also introduced the Beta-Binomial model as the first model in my DataCamp course Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R and quite a lot of people have asked me for the code I used to visualize the Beta-Binomial. Scroll to the bottom of this post if thatâ€™s what you want, otherwise, here is how I visualized the Beta-Binomial in my course given two successes and four failures:

The function that produces these plots is called `prop_model` (`prop` as in proportion) and takes a vector of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s representing successes and failures. The visualization is created using the excellent `ggridges` package (previously called joyplot). Hereâ€™s how you would use `prop_model` to produce the last plot in the animation above:

```
data <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
prop_model(data)



```

The result is, I think, a quite nice visualization of how the modelâ€™s knowledge about the parameter changes as data arrives. At `n=0` the model doesnâ€™t know anything and â€” as the default prior states that itâ€™s equally likely the proportion of success is anything from 0.0 to 1.0 â€” the result is a big, blue, and uniform square. As more data arrives the probability distribution becomes more concentrated, with the final posterior distribution at `n=6`. 

Some added features of `prop_model` is that it also plots larger data somewhat gracefully and that it returns a random sample from the posterior that can be further explored. For example: 

```
big_data <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), prob = c(0.75, 0.25),
 size = 100, replace = TRUE)
posterior <- prop_model(big_data)



```

```
quantile(posterior, c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))



```


## 2.5% 50% 98% 
## 0.68 0.77 0.84




```
## 2.5% 50% 98% 
## 0.68 0.77 0.84



```

So here we calculated that the underlying proportion of success is most likely 0.77 with a 95% CI of [0.68, 0.84] (which nicely includes the correct value of 0.75 which we used to simulate `big_data`).

To be clear, `prop_model` is not intended as anything serious, itâ€™s just meant as a nice way of exploring the Beta-Binomial model when learning Bayesian statistics, maybe as part of a workshop exercise.

# This function takes a number of successes and failuers coded as a TRUE/FALSE
# or 0/1 vector. This should be given as the data argument.
# The result is a visualization of the how a Beta-Binomial
# model gradualy learns the underlying proportion of successes 
# using this data. The function also returns a sample from the
# posterior distribution that can be further manipulated and inspected.
# The default prior is a Beta(1,1) distribution, but this can be set using the
# prior_prop argument.

 # For 20 datapoints and less we're plotting all of them.
 data_indices <- round(seq(0, length(data), length.out = min(length(data) + 1, 20)))

 # dens_curves will be a data frame with the x & y coordinates for the 
 # denities to plot where x = proportion_success and y = probability
