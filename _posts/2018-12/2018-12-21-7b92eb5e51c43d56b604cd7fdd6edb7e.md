### Introduction

What if I say that there is a way for you to become a data scientist, regardless of your programming skills! Furthermore, most people think that being proficient in a programming knowledge is a must-have for becoming a data scientist. Well, this statement is not completely true! Data science is not all about programming anymore.

In this article, we will be looking at different tools for data scientists. Different tools cover different aspects of data science, hence data scientists can make their work easy by employing these tools for different tasks. Let us understand more about these tools in detail.

### What are data science tools?

These are tools that typically obviate the programming aspect and provide user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) hence anyone with minimal knowledge of algorithms can simply use them to build high-quality machine learning models.

Many companies (especially startups) have recently launched GUI driven data science tools. These tools cover different aspects of data science like data storage, data manipulation, data modeling etc.

### Why data science tools?

1. No programming experience required

1. Better work management

1. Faster results

1. Better quality check mechanism

1. Process Uniformity


### Different Data science tools

#### Data Storage

#### 1. Apache Hadoop

Apache Hadoop is a java based free software framework that can effectively store a large amount of data in a cluster. This framework runs in parallel on a cluster. Hence, it has the ability to allow us to process data across all nodes. Also, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the storage system of Hadoop which splits big data and distribute across many nodes in a cluster. This also replicates data in a cluster thus providing high availability.

#### 2. Microsoft HDInsight

It is a Big Data solution from Microsoft powered by Apache Hadoop which is available as a service in the cloud. HDInsight uses Windows Azure Blob storage as the default file system. Also, this also provides high availability with low cost.

#### 3. NoSQL

While the traditional SQL can be effectively used to handle a large amount of structured data, we need NoSQL (Not Only SQL) to handle unstructured data. Also, NoSQL databases store unstructured data with no particular schema. Furthermore, each row can have its own set of column values. Hence, NoSQL gives better performance in storing a massive amount of data. There are many open-source NoSQL DBs available to analyze Big Data.

#### 4. Hive

This is a distributed data management for Hadoop. Also, this supports SQL-like query option HiveSQL (HSQL) to access big data. This can be primarily used for Data mining purpose. Furthermore, this runs on top of Hadoop.

#### 5. Sqoop

This is a tool that connects Hadoop with various relational databases to transfer data. This can be effectively used to transfer structured data to Hadoop or Hive.

#### 6. PolyBase

This works on top of SQL Server 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) and is used to access data stored in PDW. Furthermore, PDW is a data warehousing appliance built for processing any volume of relational data and provides integration with Hadoop allowing us to access non-relational data as well.
