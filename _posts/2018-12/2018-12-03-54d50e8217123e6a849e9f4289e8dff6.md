StanCon 2018 Helsinki talk slides, notebooks and code have been sometime available in StanCon talks repository, but it seems we forgot to announce this. The StanCon 2018 Helsinki talk list includes also links to videos.

> 
StanCon’s version of conference proceedings is a collection of contributed talks based on interactive notebooks. Every submission is peer reviewed by at least two reviewers. The reviewers are members of the Stan Conference Organizing Committee and the Stan Developmemt Team. This repository contains all of the accepted notebooks as well as any supplementary materials required for building the notebooks. The slides presented at the conference are also included.
