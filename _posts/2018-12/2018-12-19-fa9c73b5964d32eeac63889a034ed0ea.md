The ability to derive business intelligence from big data is now a highly marketable skill. As more companies realise the insight data analysis can help them achieve, this ability is likely to become even more desirable to employers from all sectors in the coming years.

We can help you delve into and refine these skills for yourself with our **Online MBA with Data Analytics**. With four immersive and highly-specialised data modules, and the real-world business knowledge provided by the core MBA modules, our course can prepare you well for a career unlocking the value of big data.

**Tell a story with data visualisations**

Data storytelling, or the ability to use complex data to clearly express an argument, is a coveted skill in many business sectors. One of the biggest challenges facing businesses in terms of data is how to present it in a way that makes actionable insight possible.

The module Statistical Approaches to Data Analysis will familiarise you with data visualisation and storytelling for the purposes of data mining and predictive modelling. You’ll learn how to visually display data in the most suitable graphical layout, to communicate its meaning to others and to foresee expected outcomes based on statistical evidence. These skills are invaluable to employers seeking Data Visualisation Analysts, Investigative Researchers and Reporting Analysts.

**Design a data storage infrastructure**

With so much data in the workplace, how are businesses to manage and store it? There’s no one solution that will suit all, so organisations must consider the best strategy based on their unique business needs.

An understanding of databases, data warehouses and cloud-based storage is all covered by the module Fundamentals of Big Data and its Infrastructure. Taking into account organisational set-up and intentions for data, you’ll be able to recommend sustainable data management approaches, perfect for a role as a Data Warehouse Manager or Big Data Architect.

**Harness the power of machine learning**

Alongside the upsurge in big data, businesses are now able to access machine learning techniques to perform certain elements of data analysis. Algorithms can be programmed to carry out analysis automatically, based on machine learning derived from vast data sets.

This automation is a powerful tool to apply to the task of data analysis. The module Practical Machine Learning Methods for Data Mining will enable you to use machine learning models to classify and cluster data, and use it to make useful business projections. Data Scientists, Machine Learning Researchers and AI Software Developers will all need these skills.

 

**Understand the wider impact of big data**

The data explosion is revolutionising not just the business world, but every area of society. As such, it’s vital for those working with big data to understand its influence within various contexts, such as nationally, internationally and in terms of ethics and legislation.

Gain this knowledge through the module, Deriving Business Value from Data Science. You’ll learn about the importance of using big data legally and responsibly, and how to obtain the insight businesses need within a best practice framework. This expertise is valuable to all types of business, particularly in roles in Strategic Governance, Data Compliance and Data Quality.

**Expand your business acumen**

As well as developing your experience of data analytics, our Online MBA will help you sharpen your key business skills. The core MBA modules, including Business Information and Decision Making, explore fundamental operational and strategic commercial approaches, giving you a wide foundation of business knowledge on which to base your career.
