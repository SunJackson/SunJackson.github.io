… this week that I made a first cameo in the debian/changelog for the Debian R package:

> 
r-base (0.63.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

- New upstream release
- Linked html directory to /usr/doc/r-base/doc/html (Dirk Eddelbuettel)

– Douglas Bates [email protected] Fri, 4 Dec 1998 14:22:19 -0600


For the next few years I assisted Doug here and there, and then formally took over in late 2001.

It’s been a really good and rewarding experience, and I hope to be able to help with this for a few more years to come.
