I want to draw your attention to a very valuable (and short!) whitepaper from my colleague, Professor Andrew Ng, where he shares important insights on how to lead companies into the AI era.

The five steps outlined in the paper are:

1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum

1. Build an in-house AI team

1. Provide broad AI training

1. Develop an AI strategy

1. Develop internal and external communications


Many points raised in the paper coincide with my own consulting experience in different industries: AI Transformation Playbook

I also recently gave an interview on the same topic, you can find it here:Artificial intelligence: What is the best way for companies to innovate?

Happy reading!
