This report describes several R packages that allow HTML content to be rendered as part of an R plot. The core package is called ‘layoutEngine’, but that package requires a “backend” package to perform HTML layout calculations. Three example backends are demonstrated: ‘layoutEngineCSSBox’, ‘layoutEnginePhantomJS’, and ‘layoutEngineDOM’. We also introduce two new font packages, ‘gyre’ and ‘courier’.
