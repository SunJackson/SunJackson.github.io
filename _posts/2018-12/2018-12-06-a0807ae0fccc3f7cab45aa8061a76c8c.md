We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper functions within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 6th day of Christmas my true love gave to me…

## What can it do?

This little helper prints a progress bar into the console for loops.

There are two nessecary parameters to feed this function:

- `run` is either the iterator or its number

- `max.run` is either all possible iterators in the order they are processed or the maximum number of iterations.


So for example it could be

- `run = 3` and `max.run = 16` or

- `run = "a"` and `max.run = letters[1:16]`.


Also there are two optional parameter:

- `percent.max` influences the width of the progress bar

- `info` is an additional character, which is printed at the end of the line. By default it is `run`.


A little disadvantage of this function is, that it does not work with parallel processes. If you want to have a progress bar when using `apply` functions check out `pbapply`.

## Overview

To see all the other functions you can either check out our GitHub or you can read about them here.

Have a merry advent season!
