This short blog post illustrates how easy it is to use R and Python in the same R Notebook thanks to the`{reticulate}` package. For this to work, you might need to upgrade RStudio to the current preview version.Let’s start by importing `{reticulate}`:

```
library(reticulate)
```

`{reticulate}` is an RStudio package that provides “*a comprehensive set of tools for interoperabilitybetween Python and R*”. With it, it is possible to call Python and use Python libraries withinan R session, or define Python chunks in R markdown. I think that using R Notebooks is the best wayto work with Python and R; when you want to use Python, you simply use a Python chunk:

	```{python}
	your python code here
	```
There’s even autocompletion for Python object methods:

Fantastic!

However, if you wish to use Python interactively within your R session, you must start the PythonREPL with the `repl_python()` function, which starts a Python REPL. You can then do whatever youwant, even access objects from your R session, and then when you exit the REPL, any object youcreated in Python remains accessible in R. I think that using Python this way is a bit more involvedand would advise using R Notebooks if you need to use both languages.

I installed the Anaconda Python distribution to have Python on my system. To use it with `{reticulate}`I must first use the `use_python()` function that allows me to set which version of Python I wantto use:

```
# This is an R chunk
use_python("~/miniconda3/bin/python")
```

I can now load a dataset, still using R:

```
# This is an R chunk
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

```
## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb
## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4
## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4
## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1
## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1
## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2
## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1
```

and now, to access the `mtcars` data frame, I simply use the `r` object:

```
# This is a Python chunk
print(r.mtcars.describe())
```

```
## mpg cyl disp ... am gear carb
## count 32.000000 32.000000 32.000000 ... 32.000000 32.000000 32.0000

## 
## [8 rows x 11 columns]
```

`.describe()` is a Python Pandas DataFrame method to get summary statistics of our data. This means that`mtcars` was automatically converted from a `tibble` object to a Pandas DataFrame! Let’s check its type:

```
# This is a Python chunk
print(type(r.mtcars))
```

```
## 
```

Let’s save the summary statistics in a variable:

```
# This is a Python chunk
summary_mtcars = r.mtcars.describe()
```

Let’s access this from R, by using the `py` object:

```
# This is an R chunk
class(py$summary_mtcars)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```

Let’s try something more complex. Let’s first fit a linear model in Python, and see how R sees it:

```
# This is a Python chunk
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
model = smf.ols('mpg ~ hp', data = r.mtcars).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

```

```

Just for fun, I ran the linear regression with the Scikit-learn library too:

```
# This is a Python chunk
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression 
regressor = LinearRegression() 
x = r.mtcars[["hp"]]
y = r.mtcars[["mpg"]]
model_scikit = regressor.fit(x, y)
print(model_scikit.intercept_)
```

```
## [30.09886054]
```

```
print(model_scikit.coef_)
```

```
## [[-0.06822828]]
```

Let’s access the `model` variable in R and see what type of object it is in R:

```
# This is an R chunk
model_r <- py$model
class(model_r)
```

```
## [1] "statsmodels.regression.linear_model.RegressionResultsWrapper"
## [2] "statsmodels.base.wrapper.ResultsWrapper" 
## [3] "python.builtin.object"
```

So because this is a custom Python object, it does not get converted into the equivalent R object.This is described here. However, you can stilluse Python methods from within an R chunk!

```
# This is an R chunk
model_r$aic
```

```
## [1] 179.2386
```

```
model_r$params
```

```
## Intercept hp 
## 30.09886054 -0.06822828
```

I must say that I am very impressed with the `{reticulate}` package. I think that even if you areprimarily a Python user, this is still very interesting to know in case you need a specific functionfrom an R package. Just write all your script inside a Python Markdown chunk and then use the Rfunction you need from an R chunk! Of course there is also a way to use R from Python, a Python librarycalled `rpy2` but I am not very familiar with it. From what I read, it seems to be also quitesimple to use.
