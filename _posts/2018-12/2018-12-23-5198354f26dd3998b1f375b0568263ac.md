Phishing is [still] the primary way attackers either commit a primary criminal act (i.e. phish a target to, say, install ransomware) or is the initial vehicle used to gain a foothold in an organization so they can perform other criminal operations to achieve some goal. As such, security teams, vendors and active members of the cybersecurity community work diligently to neutralize phishing campaigns as quickly as possible.

One popular community tool/resource in this pursuit is PhishTank which *is a collaborative clearing house for data and information about phishing on the Internet. Also, PhishTank provides an open API for developers and researchers to integrate anti-phishing data into their applications at no charge.*

While the PhishTank API is useful for real-time anti-phishing operations the data is also useful for security researchers as we work to understand the ebb, flow and evolution of these attacks. One avenue of research is to track the various features associated with phishing campaigns which include (amongst many other elements) network (internet) location of the phishing site, industry being targeted, domain names being used, what type of sites are being cloned/copied and a feature weâ€™ll be looking at in this post: what percentage of new phishing sites use SSL encryption and â€” of these â€” which type of SSL certificates are â€œen vogueâ€�.

Phishing sites are increasingly using and relying on SSL certificates because we in the information security industry spent a decade instructing the general internet surfing population to trust sites with the green lock icon near the location bar. Initially, phishers worked to compromise existing, encryption-enabled web properties to install phishing sites/pages since they could leech off of the â€œtrustedâ€� status of the associated SSL certificates. However, the advent of services like Letâ€™s Encrypt have made it possible for attacker to setup their own phishing domains that look legitimate to current-generation internet browsers and prey upon the decadeâ€™s old â€œtrust the lock iconâ€� mantra that most internet users still believe. Weâ€™ll table that path of discussion (since itâ€™s fraught with peril if you donâ€™t support the internet-do-gooder-consequences-be-darned cabalâ€™s personal agendas) and just focus on how to work with PhishTank data in R and take a look at the most prevalent SSL certs used in the past week (you can extend the provided example to go back as far as you like provided the phishing sites are still online).

### Accessing PhishTank From R

You can use the `aquarium` package [GL|GH] to gain access to the data provided by PhishTankâ€™s API (you need to sign up for access and put you API key into the `PHISHTANK_API_KEY` environment variable which is best done via your `~/.Renviron` file).

Letâ€™s setup all the packages weâ€™ll need and cache a current copy of the PhishTank data. The package forces you to utilize your own caching strategy since it doesnâ€™t make sense for it to decide that for you. Iâ€™d suggest either using the time-stamped approach below or using some type of database system (or, say, Apache Drill) to actually manage the data.

Here are the packages weâ€™ll need:

```
library(psl) # git[la|hu]b/hrbrmstr/psl
library(curlparse) # git[la|hu]b/hrbrmstr/curlparse
library(aquarium) # git[la|hu]b/hrbrmstr/aquarium
library(gt) # github/rstudio/gt
library(furrr)
library(stringi)
library(openssl)
library(tidyverse)

```

NOTE: The `psl` and `curlparse` packages are optional. Windows users will find it difficult to get them working and it may be easier to review the functions provided by the `urlparse` package and substitute equivalents for the `domain()` and `apex_domain()` functions used below. Now, we get a copy of the current PhishTank dataset & cache it:

```
if (!file.exists("~/Data/2018-12-23-fishtank.rds")) {
 xdf <- pt_read_db()
 saveRDS(xdf, "~/Data/2018-12-23-fishtank.rds")
} else {
 xdf <- readRDS("~/Data/2018-12-23-fishtank.rds")
}

```

Letâ€™s take a look:

```
glimpse(xdf)
## Observations: 16,446
## Variables: 9
## $ phish_id "5884184", "5884138", "5884136", "5884135", ...
## $ url "http://internetbanking-bancointer.com.br/lo...
## $ phish_detail_url "http://www.phishtank.com/phish_detail.php?p...
## $ submission_time 2018-12-22 20:45:09, 2018-12-22 18:40:24, 2...
## $ verified "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "y...
## $ verification_time 2018-12-22 20:45:52, 2018-12-22 21:26:49, 2...
## $ online "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "y...
## $ details [<209.132.252.7, 209.132.252.0/24, 7296 468...
## $ target "Other", "Other", "Other", "PayPal", "Other"...

```

The data is really straightforward. We have unique ids for each site/campaign the URL of the site along with a URL to extra descriptive info PhishTank has on the site/campaign. We also know when the site was submitted/discovered and other details, such as the network/internet space the site is in:

```
glimpse(xdf$details[1])
## List of 1
## $ :'data.frame': 1 obs. of 6 variables:
## ..$ ip_address : chr "209.132.252.7"
## ..$ cidr_block : chr "209.132.252.0/24"
## ..$ announcing_network: chr "7296 468"
## ..$ rir : chr "arin"
## ..$ country : chr "US"
## ..$ detail_time : chr "2018-12-23T01:46:16+00:00"

```

Weâ€™re going to focus on recent phishing sites (in this case, ones that are less than a week old) and those that use SSL certificates:

```
filter(xdf, verified == "yes") %>%
 filter(online == "yes") %>%
 mutate(diff = as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), verification_time), "days")) %>%
 filter(diff <= 7) %>%
 { all_ct <<- nrow(.) ; . } %>%
 filter(grepl("^https", url)) %>%
 { ssl_ct <<- nrow(.) ; . } %>%
 mutate(
 domain = domain(url),
 apex = apex_domain(domain)
 ) -> recent

```

Letâ€™s ee how many are using SSL:

```
(ssl_ct)
## [1] 383

(pct_ssl <- ssl_ct / all_ct)
## [1] 0.2919207

```

This percentage is lower than a recent â€œ50% of all phishing sites use encryptionâ€� statistic going around of late. There are many reasons for the difference:

- PhishTank doesnâ€™t have *all* phishing sites in it

- We just looked at a week of examples

- Some sites were offline at the time of access attempt

- Diverse attacker groups with varying degrees of competence engage in phishing attacks


Despite the 20% deviation, 30% is still a decent percentage, and a green, â€œeverythingâ€™s ![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f44d-1f3fc.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f44d-1f3fc.png?w=456&ssl=1)
â€� icon is a still a valued prize so we shall pursue our investigation.

Now we need to retrieve all those certs. This can be a slow operation that so weâ€™ll grab them in parallel. Itâ€™s also quite possible the â€œonlineâ€�status above data frame glimpse is inaccurate (sites can go offline quickly) so weâ€™ll catch certificate request failures with `safely()` and cache the results:

```
cert_dl <- purrr::safely(openssl::download_ssl_cert)

plan(multiprocess)

if (!file.exists("~/Data/recent.rds")) {

 recent <- mutate(recent, cert = future_map(domain, cert_dl))
 saveRDS(recent, "~/Data/recent.rds")

} else {
 recent <- readRDS("~/Data/recent.rds")
}

```

Let see how many request failures we had:

```
(failed <- sum(map_lgl(recent$cert, ~is.null(.x$result))))
## [1] 25

(failed / nrow(recent))
## [1] 0.06527415

```

As noted in the introduction to the blog, when attackers want to use SSL for the lock icon ruse they can either try to piggyback off of legitimate domains or rely on Letâ€™s Encrypt to help them commit crimes. Letâ€™s see what the top pâ€�apexâ€� domains](https://help.github.com/articles/about-supported-custom-domains/#apex-domains) were in use in the past week:

```
count(recent, apex, sort = TRUE)
## # A tibble: 255 x 2
## apex n
## 
## 1 000webhostapp.com 42
## 2 google.com 17
## 3 umbler.net 8
## 4 sharepoint.com 6
## 5 com-fl.cz 5
## 6 lbcpzonasegurabeta-viabcp.com 4
## 7 windows.net 4
## 8 ashaaudio.net 3
## 9 brijprints.com 3
## 10 portaleisp.com 3
## # ... with 245 more rows

```

We can see that a large hosting provider (`000webhostapp.com`) bore a decent number of these sites, but Google Sites (which is what the full domain represented by the `google.com` apex domain here is usually pointing to) Microsoft SharePoint (`sharepoint.com`) and Microsoft forums (`windows.net`) are in active use as well (which is smart give the pervasive trust associated with those properties). There are 241 distinct apex domains in this 1-week set so what is the SSL cert diversity across these pages/campaigns?

We ultimately used `openssl::download_ssl_cert` to retrieve the SSL certs of each site that was online, so letâ€™s get the issuer and intermediary certs from them and look at the prevalence of each. Weâ€™ll extract the fields from the `issuer` component returned by `openssl::download_ssl_cert` then just do some basic maths:

```
filter(recent, map_lgl(cert, ~!is.null(.x$result))) %>%
 mutate(issuers = map(cert, ~map_chr(.x$result, ~.x$issuer))) %>%
 mutate(
 inter = map_chr(issuers, ~.x[1]), # the order is not guaranteed here but the goal of the exercise is
 root = map_chr(issuers, ~.x[2]) # to get you working with the data vs build a 100% complete solution
 ) %>%
 mutate(
 inter = stri_replace_all_regex(inter, ",([[:alpha:]])+=", ";;;$1=") %>%
 stri_split_fixed(";;;") %>% # there are parswers for the cert info fields but this hack is quick and works
 map(stri_split_fixed, "=", 2, simplify = TRUE) %>%
 map(~setNames(as.list(.x[,2]), .x[,1])) %>%
 map(bind_cols),
 root = stri_replace_all_regex(root, ",([[:alpha:]])+=", ";;;$1=") %>%
 stri_split_fixed(";;;") %>%
 map(stri_split_fixed, "=", 2, simplify = TRUE) %>%
 map(~setNames(as.list(.x[,2]), .x[,1])) %>%
 map(bind_cols)
 ) -> recent

```

Letâ€™s take a look at roots:

```
unnest(recent, root) %>%
 distinct(phish_id, apex, CN) %>%
 count(CN, sort = TRUE) %>%
 mutate(pct = n/sum(n)) %>%
 gt::gt() %>%
 gt::fmt_number("n", decimals = 0) %>%
 gt::fmt_percent("pct")

```
