Exercise template for computing the 2-sided confidence interval (with extended Moodle processing) for the mean based on a random sample.

**Description:**

Computing the 2-sided confidence interval at 95% level for the mean based on a random sample. The exercise is a cloze with two numeric answers for the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval, respectively. Using the ‘verbatim’ clozetype for Moodle, the exercises yields 100% of the points for the correct solution based on t quantiles but still 50% for a partially correct solution based on normal quantiles.

**Randomization:**

Random numbers

**Mathematical notation:**

Yes

**Verbatim R input/output:**

No

*(Note that the HTML output contains mathematical equations in MathML. It is displayed by browsers with MathML support like Firefox or Safari – but not Chrome.)*

**Demo code:**

```
library("exams")

exams2html("confint3.Rnw")
set.seed(1090)
exams2pdf("confint3.Rnw")

exams2html("confint3.Rmd")
set.seed(1090)
