**dAIrector** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
dAIrector is an automated director which collaborates with humans storytellers for live improvisational performances and writing assistance. dAIrector can be used to create short narrative arcs through contextual plot generation. In this work, we present the system architecture, a quantitative evaluation of design choices, and a case-study usage of the system which provides qualitative feedback from a professional improvisational performer. We present relevant metrics for the understudied domain of human-machine creative generation, specifically long-form narrative creation. We include, alongside publication, open-source code so that others may test, evaluate, and run the dAIrector. … 

**Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper presents a new approach to non-parametric cluster analysis called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering structure by checking at different points and for different scales on departure from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering structure in terms of weights \( w_{ij} \) each of them measures the degree of local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of ‘no gap’ between them. % The procedure starts from very local scale, then the parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the procedure is able to recover different clusters with sharp edges or manifold structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various artificial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity. … 

**Decoupled Learning** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Incorporating encoding-decoding nets with adversarial nets has been widely adopted in image generation tasks. We observe that the state-of-the-art achievements were obtained by carefully balancing the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss, and such balance shifts with different network structures, datasets, and training strategies. Empirical studies have demonstrated that an inappropriate weight between the two losses may cause instability, and it is tricky to search for the optimal setting, especially when lacking prior knowledge on the data and network. This paper gives the first attempt to relax the need of manual balancing by proposing the concept of \textit{decoupled learning}, where a novel network structure is designed that explicitly disentangles the backpropagation paths of the two losses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and generality of the proposed method. The other contribution of the paper is the design of a new evaluation metric to measure the image quality of generative models. We propose the so-called \textit{normalized relative discriminative score} (NRDS), which introduces the idea of relative comparison, rather than providing absolute estimates like existing metrics. …
