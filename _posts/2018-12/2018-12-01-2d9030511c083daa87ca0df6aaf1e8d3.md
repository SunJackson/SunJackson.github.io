We at STATWORX work a lot with R and we often use the same little helper function within our projects. These functions ease our daily work life by reducing repetitive code parts or by creating overviews of our projects. At first, there was no plan to make a package, but soon I realised, that it will be much easier to share and improve those functions, if they are within a package. Up till the 24th December I will present one function each day from `helfRlein`. So, on the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me…

## What can it do?

This little helper checks a given folder path for existence and creates it if needed.

```
checkdir(path = "testfolder/subfolder")

```

Internaly, there is just a simple if statement which combines the base R functions `file.exists()` and `dir.create()`. 

## Overview

To see all the other functions you can either check out our GitHub or you can read about the them here.

Have a merry advent season!
