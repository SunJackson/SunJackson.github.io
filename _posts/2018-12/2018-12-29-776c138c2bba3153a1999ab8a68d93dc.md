**Manifold** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Interpretation and diagnosis of machine learning models have gained renewed interest in recent years with breakthroughs in new approaches. We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models’ outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination. We demonstrate current applications of the framework on the classification and regression tasks and discuss other potential machine learning use scenarios where Manifold can be applied. … 

**Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Complex industrial systems are continuously monitored by a large number of heterogenous sensors. The diversity of their operating conditions and the possible fault types make it impossible to collect enough data for learning all the possible fault patterns. The paper proposes an integrated automatic unsupervised feature learning approach for fault detection that uses healthy conditions data only for its training. The approach is based on stacked Extreme Learning Machines (namely Hierarchical, or HELM) and comprises stacked autoencoders performing unsupervised feature learning, and a one-class classifier monitoring the variations in the features to assess the health of the system. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of HELM fault detection capability compared to other machine learning approaches, including Deep Belief Networks. The performance is first evaluated on a synthetic dataset with typical characteristics of condition monitoring data. Subsequently, the approach is evaluated on a real case study of a power plant fault. HELM demonstrates a better performance specifically in cases where several non-informative signals are included. … 

**Reinforced Co-Training** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Co-training is a popular semi-supervised learning framework to utilize a large amount of unlabeled data in addition to a small labeled set. Co-training methods exploit predicted labels on the unlabeled data and select samples based on prediction confidence to augment the training. However, the selection of samples in existing co-training methods is based on a predetermined policy, which ignores the sampling bias between the unlabeled and the labeled subsets, and fails to explore the data space. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Reinforced Co-Training, to select high-quality unlabeled samples to better co-train on. More specifically, our approach uses Q-learning to learn a data selection policy with a small labeled dataset, and then exploits this policy to train the co-training classifiers automatically. Experimental results on clickbait detection and generic text classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain more accurate text classification results. …
