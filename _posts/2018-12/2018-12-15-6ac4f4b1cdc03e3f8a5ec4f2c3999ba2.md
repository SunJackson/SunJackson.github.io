**Is The Enterprise Knowledge Graph Finally Going To Make All Data Usable?**

When we ask Siri, Alexa or Google Home a question, we often get alarmingly relevant answers. Why? And more importantly, why don’t we get the same quality of answers and smooth experience in our businesses where the stakes are so much higher? The answer is that these services are all powered by extensive knowledge graphs that allow the questions to be mapped to an organized set of information that can often provide the answer we want. Is it impossible for anyone but the big tech companies to organize information and deliver a pleasing experience? In my view, the answer is no. The technology to collect and integrate data so we can know more about our businesses is being delivered in different ways by a number of products. Only a few use constructs similar to a knowledge graph.
