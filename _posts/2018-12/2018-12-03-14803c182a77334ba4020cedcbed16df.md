**Detail-Preserving Pooling (DPP)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Most convolutional neural networks use some method for gradually downscaling the size of the hidden layers. This is commonly referred to as pooling, and is applied to reduce the number of parameters, improve invariance to certain distortions, and increase the receptive field size. Since pooling by nature is a lossy process, it is crucial that each such layer maintains the portion of the activations that is most important for the network’s discriminability. Yet, simple maximization or averaging over blocks, max or average pooling, or plain downsampling in the form of strided convolutions are the standard. In this paper, we aim to leverage recent results on image downscaling for the purposes of deep learning. Inspired by the human visual system, which focuses on local spatial changes, we propose detail-preserving pooling (DPP), an adaptive pooling method that magnifies spatial changes and preserves important structural detail. Importantly, its parameters can be learned jointly with the rest of the network. We analyze some of its theoretical properties and show its empirical benefits on several datasets and networks, where DPP consistently outperforms previous pooling approaches. … 

**ShapeSearch** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Identifying trendline visualizations with desired patterns is a common and fundamental data exploration task. Existing visual analytics tools offer limited flexibility and expressiveness for such tasks, especially when the pattern of interest is under-specified and approximate, and do not scale well when the pattern searching needs are ad-hoc, as is often the case. We propose ShapeSearch, an efficient and flexible pattern-searching tool, that enables the search for desired patterns via multiple mechanisms: sketch, natural-language, and visual regular expressions. We develop a novel shape querying algebra, with a minimal set of primitives and operators that can express a large number of ShapeSearch queries, and design a natural-language and regex-based parser to automatically parse and translate user queries to the algebra representation. To execute these queries within interactive response times, ShapeSearch uses a fast shape algebra-based execution engine with query-aware optimizations, and perceptually-aware scoring methodologies. We present a thorough evaluation of the system, including a general-purpose user study, a case study involving genomic data analysis, as well as performance experiments, comparing against state-of-the-art time series shape matching approaches—that together demonstrate the usability and scalability of ShapeSearch. … 

**Latent Tree Models** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Latent tree models are graphical models defined on trees, in which only a subset of variables is observed. They were first discussed by Judea Pearl as tree-decomposable distributions to generalise star-decomposable distributions such as the latent class model. Latent tree models, or their submodels, are widely used in: phylogenetic analysis, network tomography, computer vision, causal modeling, and data clustering. They also contain other well-known classes of models like hidden Markov models, Brownian motion tree model, the Ising model on a tree, and many popular models used in phylogenetics. This article offers a concise introduction to the theory of latent tree models. We emphasise the role of tree metrics in the structural description of this model class, in designing learning algorithms, and in understanding fundamental limits of what and when can be learned. …
