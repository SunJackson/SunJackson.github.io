Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction will begin shipping next week. I’ve written an R package that contains datasets, functions, and a course packet to go along with the book. The `socviz` package contains about twenty five datasets and a number of utility and convenience functions. The datasets range in size from things with just a few rows (used for purely illustrative purproses) to datasets with over 120,000 observations, for practicing with and exploring.

A course packet is also included the package. This is a zipped file containing an R Studio project consisting of nine R Markdown documents that parallel the chapters in the book. They contain the code for almost all the figures in the book (and a few more besides). There are also some additional support files, to help demonstrate things like reading in your own data locally in R.

## Installing the package

To install the package, you can follow the instructions in the Preface to the book. Alternatively, first download and install R for MacOS, Windows or Linux, as appropriate. Then download and install RStudio. Launch RStudio and then type the following code at the Console prompt (`>`), hitting return at the end of each line:

```


my_packages <- c("tidyverse", "fs", "devtools")
install.packages(my_packages)


devtools::install_github("kjhealy/socviz")

```

Once everything has downloaded and been installed (which may take a little while), load the `socviz` package:

## The Course Packet

The supporting materials are contained in a compressed `.zip` file. To extract them to your Desktop, make sure the `socviz` package is loaded as described above. Then do this:

```


setup_course_notes()


```

This will copy the `dataviz_course_notes.zip` file to your Desktop, and uncompress it into a folder called `dataviz_course_notes`. Double-click the file named `dataviz.Rproj` to launch the project as a new RStudio session. If you want to uncompress the file somewhere other than your Desktop, e.g. your Documents folder, you can do this:

```


setup_course_notes(folder = "~/Documents")


```

The source code for `socviz` is available on GitHub. I plan on continuing to update and improve it as I use it myself in my own classes and workshops.
