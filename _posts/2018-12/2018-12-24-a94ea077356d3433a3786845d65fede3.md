**At: University of Virginia**![](http://feedproxy.google.com/jimg/uva.jpg)
**Location: Charlottesville, VA****Web: virginia.edu****Position: Faculty, Open Rank Model and Simulation at the Human-Technology Frontier**

**Apply here**.

The School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Virginia seeks applicants for an open rank tenure-track/tenured faculty position in the area of modeling and simulation at the human-technology frontier. We are seeking candidates who are committed to fundamental research enabling intelligent systems such as virtual humans and robots to seamlessly interact with humans. Interdisciplinary researchers across schools and institutes at UVA are creating translational human-in-the-loop technologies such as data-driven modeling of human behavior, immersive interactive teaching simulations, simulation-based training for medical professionals, game-based learning to improve cultural competence, and intelligent cognitive assistants for mental health.

We seek a leader in the engineering and technological aspects who will collaborate with colleagues across UVA on the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of next-generation human-in-the-loop modeling and simulation technologies. The ideal candidate will provide intellectual leadership in one or more of the technological areas necessary for creating simulation-based training environments, including computational modeling of human behavior, natural language processing, affective computing, social robotics, embodied conversational agents, and/or virtual/augmented/mixed reality.

The faculty member will have the opportunity to hold an appointment in the Link Lab, UVA's world-class center of excellence in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This initiative includes over two dozen faculty drawn from multiple departments and builds on UVA's strengths and pioneering work in areas such as smart cities, smart health, and autonomous systems. Additionally, UVA offers extensive opportunities for collaborative research with the Curry School of Education, the Data Science Institute, the Center for Global Health, the Behavior Research at Darden Lab, the Translational Health Research Institute of Virginia (THRIV), the Center for Engineering and Medicine, the Center for Diabetes Technology, and the Environmental Resilience Institute.

A doctoral degree is required prior to the start date of this position in engineering, computer science, or a closely related field. Candidates must have a record of excellence in research, as appropriate for the candidate's rank, and a commitment to teaching excellence. Appointment with tenure requires documented excellence in research and teaching and an emerging national reputation. Preference will be given to candidates who would flourish in and support a collaborative, diverse community and who would complement or expand the strengths of the Department's current faculty.

To apply: jobs.virginia.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=85937.

Complete a Candidate Profile online; attach a CV, cover letter, statements of teaching philosophy and research interests, and contact information for 3 references.

Review applications will begin December 7, 2018 and will continue until the position is filled.
