Christopher Bishop, a Technical Fellow at Microsoft Research, has released his textbook******Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** as a free PDF download.

The book is a bit older, published in 2006, but it stills contains some great information. Some of the topics covered include:
- Probability Distributions
- Regression
- Classification
- Neural Networks
- Ensemble Models
- K-Means Clustering
- and many more….

Happy Reading!
