In this tutorial, I will cover how to include custom JavaScript, CSS and HTML code in your R shiny app. By including them, you can make a very powerful professional web app using R.


**First let’s understand basics of a Webpage**

In general, web page contains the following section of details.

1. Content (Header, Paragraph, Footer, Listing)

1. Font style, color, background, border

1. Images and Videos

1. Popups, widgets, special effects etc.



**HTML, CSS and JavaScript**


These 3 web programming languages in conjunction  take care of all the information webpage contains (from text to adding special effects).

1. **HTML determines the content and structure of a page (header, paragraph, footer etc.)**

1. **CSS controls how webpage would look like (color, font type, border etc.)**

1. **JavaScript decides advanced behaviors such as pop-up, animation etc.**

|Fundamentals of Webpage|

> One of the most common web development term you should know : **rendering**. It is the act of putting together a web page for presentation.

**Shiny Dashboard Syntax**

In this section, I am using syntax of shinydashboard library. The structure of shinydashboard syntax is similar to shiny library. Both requires `ui` and `server `components. However, functions are totally different. Refer the code below. Make sure to install library before using the following program.

# User Interfaceui = dashboardPage(dashboardHeader(title = "Blank Shiny App"),dashboardSidebar(),dashboardBody() )

# Serverserver = function(input, output) { }

# Run ApprunApp(list(ui = ui, server = server), launch.browser =T)

**Example : Create Animation Effect**

The program below generates animation in the web page. To test it, you can check out this **link.** When user hits **“Click Me”** button, it will trigger **demojs() JavaScript** which will initiate animation. It’s a very basic animation. You can edit the code and make it as complex as you want.

## CSS

#myContainer {width: 400px;height: 400px;position: relative;background: black;}

## JS

There are several ways to include custom JavaScript and CSS codes in Shiny. Some of the common ones are listed below with detailed explanation –

**Method I : Use tags to insert HTML, CSS and JS Code in Shiny**

**HTML**

> tags$body(HTML(“**Your HTML Code**“))

**CSS**

> tags$head(HTML(“”))

**OR******CSS code can also be defined using **tags$style. **

> tags$head(**tags$style**(HTML(” Your CSS Code “)))

**JS**

> tags$head(HTML(“”))

**OR******JS code can be described with **tags$script**.

> tags$head(tags$script(HTML(” Your JS Code “)))

Code specified in `tags$head` means it will be included and executed under ` `. Similarly `tags$body` can also be used to make shiny run code within ` `

**tags$head vs. tags$body**

In general, JavaScript and CSS files are defined inside **** ****

**Animation Code in Shiny**



“)), # HTML Code box(tags$body(HTML(“

Click Me 


“)), height = 400) )) server = function(input, output) { } runApp(list(ui = ui, server = server), launch.browser =T) 

**Important Note**

> In JS, CSS and HTML code, make sure to replace double quotation mark with single quotation mark under shiny’s **HTML(” “)** function as it considers double quotation mark as closing the function.

**Method II : Call JavaScript and CSS files in Shiny**

You can use ` includeScript( ) ` and `includeCSS( )` functions to refer JS and CSS codes from files saved in your local directory. You can save the files anywhere and mention the file location of them in the functions.

**How to create JS and CSS files manually**

> Open notepad and paste JS code and save it with **.js file extension** and file type **“All files”** (not text document). Similarly you can create css file using .css file extension.

library(shinydashboard) # User Interface ui <- dashboardPage( dashboardHeader(title = "Basic Use of JS and CSS"), dashboardSidebar(), dashboardBody( # Call Javasript and CSS Code from file tags$head( includeScript("C:\\Users\\DELL\\Documents\\animate.js"), includeCSS("C:\\Users\\DELL\\Documents\\animation.css") ), # HTML Code box(tags$body(HTML("

Click Me 


“)), height = 400) )) server = function(input, output) { } runApp(list(ui = ui, server = server), launch.browser =T) 

**When to use Method 2?**

> When you want to include a big (lengthy) JS / CSS code, use method 2. Method 1 should be used for small code snippets as RStudio does not support coloring and error-checking of JS / CSS code. Also it makes code unnecessary lengthy which makes difficult to maintain.

**Method III : Add JS and CSS files under www directory**

**Step 1 : ****Create an app using shinyApp( )** function and save it as **app.R**. Refer the code below.****library(shinydashboard) library(shinydashboard) app <- shinyApp( ui <- dashboardPage( dashboardHeader(title = "Basic Use of JS"), dashboardSidebar(), dashboardBody( # Javasript and CSS Code tags$head(tags$script(src="animate.js")), tags$head(tags$link(rel="stylesheet", type = "text/css", href = "animation.css")), # HTML Code box(tags$body(HTML("

Click Me 


“)), height = 400) )) , server = function(input, output) { } ) 

**Step 2 :**Create a folder named `www` in your app directory (where your app `app.r` file is stored) and save `.js` and `.css` files under the folder. Refer the folder structure below.

**Step 3 :****Submit runApp( ) **function. Specify path of app directory.

> runApp(appDir = “C:/Users/DELL/Documents”, launch.browser = T)
