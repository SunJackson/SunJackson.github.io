A friend of mine is visiting Chicago this week, and we got together
with a group of friends for a beer. History reveals that this
activity with this group results in one of two potential outcomes: a
discussion that prompts several Wikipedia searches to resolve a
debate about an esoteric topic, or a bet that involves sports data
and statistical tests. This time, it was the latter.



The topic in question was whether or not best-of-seven series in the
NHL playoffs go to seven games more or less than one would expect
under a very simplistic model: individual game results are
determined by coin flips. One person
(“person-whose-side-I-wish-I'd-taken”) argued that NHL
playoff series go the distance less than you would expect under the
coin-flip model, because a matchup is typically not balanced and the
probability of one team winning is greater than half. The other
person (“the fool”) argued that teams that are behind in
a series dig in and try harder, and thus series would go to seven as
much or more than one would expect under the coin-flip model.



Being an unbiased third party, I took it upon myself to settle the
bet. I was able to obtain the playoff game score data from
the official NHL
web page and quickly parse out only the best-of-seven series.
As of the end of the 2009 season, 129 of 547 (24 percent) of the
best-of-seven series actually went to seven games. By simulating
the coin-flip model for 547 best-of-seven series a million times, it
is clear that person-whose-side-I-wish-I'd-taken was correct, and
the actual number of series that go the distance is significantly (p
= 0.00003) less than one would expect under the coin-flipping model
, where the 95 percent confidence interval is 150 to 193 games, or
27 to 35 percent.

The black line is the distribution of the fraction of series
that go to seven games under the simplistic coin-flip model.
The red line is the fraction of NHL best-of-seven playoff
series that have actually gone to seven games.

is the cumulative distribution function of the number of series that
go to seven games (out of 547) under the coin-flip model.
