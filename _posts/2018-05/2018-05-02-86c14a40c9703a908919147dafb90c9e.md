 Data are becoming the new raw material of business 
 The Economist

Tricia Wang, co-founder of [SuddenCompass](https://www.suddencompass.com/.) joined [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/) for the June 2018 episode of our free online webinar series, Data Science in 30 minutes: Why Big Data Needs Thick Data.

Why do so many companies make bad decisions, even with access to unprecedented amounts of data? Tricia has the answer: companies are implementing “big data” without what she calls the secret, missing ingredient, “thick data” – precious, unquantifiable insights from actual people – to make the right business decisions and thrive in the unknown. Tricia shared stories and lessons from how her company, Sudden Compass, advises and teaches organizations to unlock insights from big data and turn their big data projects from optimizing the bottom-line to driving growth.
