](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SQLitepandas-1.png)***This technical article was written for The Data Incubator by [Paul Paczuski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paczuski), a Fellow of our 2016 Spring cohort in New York City who landed a job with our hiring partner, [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) as a Clinical Data Scientist.***

As a data scientist, we all know that unglamorous data manipulation is 90% of the work. Two of the most common data manipulation tools are SQL and pandas. In this blog, we’ll compare the performance of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), a simple form of SQL favored by Data Scientists.

Let’s find out the tasks at which each of these excel. Below, we compare Python’s `pandas` to `sqlite` for some common data analysis operations: sort, select, load, join, filter, and group by.



 

*Note that the axis is logarithmic, so that raw differences are more pronounced.*

 

## Analysis details

For the analysis, we ran the six tasks 10 times each, for 5 different sample sizes, for each of 3 programs: `pandas`, `sqlite`, and `memory-sqlite` (where database is in memory instead of on disk). See [below](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2018/05/sqlite-vs-pandas-performance-benchmarks#code) for the definitions of each task.

Our sample data was randomly generated. Here’s what it looks like:

```
sql_vs_pandas$ head -n 5 data/sample.100.csv

qqFjQHQc,c,1981,82405.59262172286
vILuhVGz,a,1908,27712.27152250119
mwCjpoOF,f,1992,58974.38538762843
kGbriYAK,d,1927,42258.24179716961
MeoxuJng,c,1955,96907.56416314292

```

This consists of a random string of 8 characters, a random single character (for the filtering operation), a random integer simulating a year (1900-2000), and a uniform random float value between 10000 and 100000.

 

## Results

`sqlite` or `memory-sqlite` is faster for the following tasks:

- `select` two columns from data (<.1 millisecond for any data size for `sqlite`. `pandas` scales with the data, up to just under 0.5 seconds for 10 million records)

- `filter` data (>10x-50x faster with `sqlite`. The difference is more pronounced as data grows in size)

- `sort` by single column: `pandas` is always a bit slower, but this was the closest


`pandas` is faster for the following tasks:

- `groupby` computation of a mean and sum (significantly better for large data, only 2x faster for <10k records)

- `load` data from disk (5x faster for >10k records, even better for smaller data)

- `join` data (2-5x faster, but slower for smallest dataset of 1000 rows)


Comparing `memory-sqlite` vs. `sqlite`, there was no meaningful difference, especially as data size increased.

There is no significant speedup from loading `sqlite` in its own shell vs. via `pandas`.

Overall, joining and loading data is the slowest whereas select and filter are generally the fastest. Further, `pandas` seems to be optimized for group-by operations, where it performs really well (group-by is `pandas`‘ second fastest operation for larger data).

Note that this analysis assumes you are equally proficient in writing code with both! But these results could encourage you to learn the tool that you are less familiar with, if the performance gains are significant.

All code is [on our GitHub page](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs).

Below are the definitions of our six tasks: sort, select, load, join, filter, and group by (see `driver/sqlite_driver.py` or `driver/pandas_driver.py`).

`sqlite` is first, followed by `pandas`:

### [](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/sqlite-vs-pandas.md#sort)sort

```
def sort(self):
 self._cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY name ASC;')
 self._conn.commit()

def sort(self):
 self.df_employee.sort_values(by='name')

```

### [](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/sqlite-vs-pandas.md#select)select

```
def select(self):
 self._cursor.execute('SELECT name, dept FROM employee;')
 self._conn.commit()

def select(self):
 self.df_employee[["name", "dept"]]

```

### [](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/sqlite-vs-pandas.md#load)load

```
def load(self):
 self._cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE employee (name varchar(255), dept char(1), birth int, salary double);')
 df = pd.read_csv(self.employee_file)
 df.columns = employee_columns
 df.to_sql('employee', self._conn, if_exists='replace')

 self._cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE bonus (name varchar(255), bonus double);')
 df_bonus = pd.read_csv(self.bonus_file)
 df_bonus.columns = bonus_columns
 df_bonus.to_sql('bonus', self._conn, if_exists='replace')

def load(self):
 self.df_employee = pd.read_csv(self.employee_file)
 self.df_employee.columns = employee_columns

 self.df_bonus = pd.read_csv(self.bonus_file)
 self.df_bonus.columns = bonus_columns

```

### [](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/sqlite-vs-pandas.md#join)join

```
def join(self):
 self._cursor.execute('SELECT employee.name, employee.salary + bonus.bonus '
 'FROM employee INNER JOIN bonus ON employee.name = bonus.name')
 self._conn.commit()

def join(self):
 joined = self.df_employee.merge(self.df_bonus, on='name')
 joined['total'] = joined['bonus'] + joined['salary']

```

### [](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/sqlite-vs-pandas.md#filter)filter

```
def filter(self):
 self._cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dept = "a";')
 self._conn.commit()

def filter(self):
 self.df_employee[self.df_employee['dept'] == 'a']

```

### [](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/sqlite-vs-pandas.md#group-by)group by

```
def groupby(self):
 self._cursor.execute('SELECT avg(birth), sum(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY dept;')
 self._conn.commit()

def groupby(self):
 self.df_employee.groupby("dept").agg({'birth': np.mean, 'salary': np.sum})

```

 

## Details

We used `pandas` version `0.19.1` and `sqlite` version `3.13.0`. All tests were ran on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) `Ubuntu 14.04` with 16GB memory and 8 core CPU.
