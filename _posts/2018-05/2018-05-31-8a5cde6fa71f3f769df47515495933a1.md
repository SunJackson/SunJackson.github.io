A quick puzzle this week.

Your friend offers you a bet: Roll six dice, and if you get *exactly four distinct numbers* you win.

**Question**: would you accept this deal at even odds?

For example a roll of 1,2,3,6,3,6 would win but a 1,6,3,4,2,6 would be a loss.

  LOSS

Give it a few minutes thought …

## Solution

There are many ways to solve this. One of these is with brute force. There are only 46,656 possible combinations the dice can land on (6  ×  6  ×  6  ×  6  ×  6  ×  6), and it’s just a couple of lines of code to write some nested loops and perform the check.

Here is a table showing the frequency count of every distinct combination of the spots.

|Distinct Count|Frequency|------
|1|6|
|2|930|
|3|10,800|
|4|23,400|
|5|10,800|
|6|720|
|**TOTAL**|46,656|

As you can see, the total number of combinations with a distinct count of four is 23,400/46,656 which simplifies to 325/648, which is just a little more than 50:50, so it’s (just) slightly better than even odds. Yes, it’s a good bet to take!

*Yes, it's a good bet.*

## Formal Solution

Solving with brute force might not be very elegant, but it’s simple to write. You could optimize a little from symmetry, but let’s apply logic and come up for a formal solution.

There are only two possible ways we can get a distinct count of four:

Three of a kind, then three distinct singletons.

Two (different) pairs, with two distinct singletons.


### Triple

There are 6 possible values for what the triplet dice would be, and there are *6 choose 3* ways this triplet could appear. There are then 5 values that the first singleton could be, 4 values for the second, and 3 for the last singleton. This is 6  ×  6*C*3  ×  5  ×  4  ×  3 = 7,200 possible combinations.

7,200/46,656 = 25/162.

### Two Pair
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/may22018/c2.png)


With two pairs, there are 6*C*2 for what these numbers are. The first pair has 6*C*2 choices of where to go, and the second pair has 4*C*2 choices of position. There are then 4 possible combinations for the first singleton, and 3 possible for the last singleton.

This is 6*C*2  ×  6*C*2  ×  4*C*2  ×  4  ×  3 = 15  ×  15  ×  6  ×  4  ×  3 = 16,200 possible combinations.

16,200/46,656 = 25/72.

### Total

Adding these together, we get (7,200+16,200)/46,656 = 23,400/46,656 = 325/648

This confirms the answer we obtained from brute force! (Approx 50.15%)
