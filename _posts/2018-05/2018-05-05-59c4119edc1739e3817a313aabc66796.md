As I have mentioned 
[before](https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2018/how-to-connect-r-to-several-different-dbs.html), 
I like running queries directly from R, so I can analyze the results directly. 
One downside of this is that sometimes there are queries that take a few minutes 
to finish, so I would be better saving the result and reading it from disk, but 
if I have to modify anything in the SQL syntax I also have to replace the 
previous file with the results. That defeats the purpose of running the entire 
thing from R.

So I have resorted to something very simple but effective:

In the above example, `get_db_function` is any of the functions that I mentioned 
in the article that I linked above. For example:

The query will run the first time I use it, and as long as I don't modify it 
I'll get the same results immediately. This assumes that this is an intended 
effect, which may not be true in all cases. Some modifications can be made (for 
instance, return the cached result only if it's not older than N hours), but you 
get the idea.
