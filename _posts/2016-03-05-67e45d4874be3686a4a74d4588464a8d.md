Together with other scikit-learn developers we've created an umbrella organization for scikit-learn-related projects named [scikit-learn-contrib](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib). The idea is for this organization to host projects that are deemed too specific or too experimental to be included in the scikit-learn codebase but still offer an API which is compatible with scikit-learn and would like to benefit of the visibility of being labeled as scikit-learn-compatible.

We've set two requirements to being under this umbrella right now (this might evolve in the future). The first requirement is to have a scikit-learn compatible API, i.e., to follow [the guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects) on the scikit-learn documentation so that objects can be used by scikit-learn meta-estimators (such as [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html)). The second condition is that projects should be actively maintaned and have a high-quality codebase. Judging the quality of a codebase is difficult and subjective, but we agreed that at the bare minimum, the source code should be tested using continuous integration tools such as [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and reach a good test coverage (above 80%). More information is not available on the [scikit-learn-contrib repository](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-contrib/blob/master/workflow.md).

The first project to be hosted by this organization is [lightning](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/lightning), but we hope that others will follow. If you would like to submit a new project, open an issue at the [main project](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-contrib) and we will look into it. There is also a [project template](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template) for new and old projects.
