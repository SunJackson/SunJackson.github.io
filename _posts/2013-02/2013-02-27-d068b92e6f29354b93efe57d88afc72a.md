A couple of us
([@deanmalmgren](http://twitter.com/deanmalmgren)
and [@mstringer](http://twitter.com/mstringer)) just
arrived in Santa Clara for
the Strata
Conference. We're looking forward to meeting people, staying
aware of what's going on,
and speaking
about one of our projects.



To help navigate who's speaking and tweeting at the conference, we
scraped up some data about Strata attendees and speakers that use
Twitter. The following table shows anybody who has a valid Twitter
handle linked on their Strata conference profile, along with whether
they are speaking and the number of followers within the Strata
conference.



To generate the table, we pulled all of the people with valid twitter
handles from the conference attendee directory with a python script
and then used the Twitter API to find all of their followers. The data
was collected on February 25, and is not being updated as the
conference goes on (and as people meet each other at the conference
and follow each other!). We'll post a follow up with what this looks
like post-conference, but in the meantime we hope you find this useful
as you meet folks at Strata. Hope to talk to you soon!
