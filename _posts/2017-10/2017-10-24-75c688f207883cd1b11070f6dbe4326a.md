My slides on AWS Machine Learning platform at the Global Big Data conference - NYC 2017 Oct 24.

**tl;dr**: The AWS Machine Learning service is a simple but very efficient predictive analytics service for supervised classification and regression.
The AWS ML service greatly simplifies the model selection and model optimization phases of the data science workflow. However it is somewhat limited when it comes to feature engineering. This is where an auto-ml platform such as [Predicsis.ai](https://predicsis.ai/) comes in. Predicsis.ai is a service available on the AWS marketplace that generates predictive features in hierarchical datasets (multiple sources for user profile, user online behavior and user buying events for instance). When used in combination Predicsis.ai and the AWS ML service have the power to greatly shorten the data science cycle from the expression of the business problem to actionable insights to stakeholders.
