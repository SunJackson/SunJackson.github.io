In deep learning, one often works with a high-level interface of a particular framework.
No need for computing gradients manually, just stack layers with your favorite Keras. 

The bad thing: as soon as it's a black box, black magic effects happen.
Today I've faced one weird effect while implementing some kind of hard example mining.

Let's have a look:

I see no reason to describe the whole code - just focus on two last functions.
For some mysterious reason, calling `predict` within a hard sample generator leads to a `ValueError`.
At the same time, it's enough to call a single `predict` before, and it works.

In the ideal world, I would investigate this in the very deep core of Keras and Tensorflow.
In the real world, I'm happy to see the solution working with this weird fix.
