In a previous post, I wrote about what I use association rules for and mentioned a Shiny application I developed to explore and visualize rules. This post is about that app. The app is mainly a wrapper around the arules and arulesViz packages developed by Michael Hahsler.

## Features

train association rules
 
- interactively adjust confidence and support parameters

- sort rules

- sample just top rules to prevent crashes

- post process rules by subsetting LHS or RHS to just variables/items of interest

- suite of interest measures


- grouped plot, matrix plot, graph, scatterplot, parallel coordinates, item frequency


## How to get

**Option 1:** Copy the code below from the arules_app.R gist

**Option2:** Source gist directly.

```
library('devtools')
library('shiny')
library('arules')
library('arulesViz')
source_gist(id='706a28f832a33e90283b')
```

**Option 3:** Download the Rsenal package (my personal R package with a hodgepodge of data science tools) and use the `arulesApp` function:

```
library('devtools')
install_github('brooksandrew/Rsenal')
library('Rsenal')
?Rsenal::arulesApp
```

## How to use

`arulesApp` is intended to be called from the R console for interactive and exploratory use. It calls `shinyApp` which spins up a Shiny app without the overhead of having to worry about placing server.R and ui.R. Calling a Shiny app with a function also has the benefit of smooth passing of parameters and data objects as arguments. More on `shinyApp` here.

`arulesApp` is currently highly exploratory (and highly unoptimized). Therefore it works best for quickly iterating on rule training and visualization with low-medium sized datasets. Check out Michael Hahslerâ€™s arulesViz paper for a thorough description of how to interpret the visualizations. There is a particularly useful table on page 24 which compares and summarizes the visualization techniques.

Simply call `arulesApp` from the console with a data.frame or transaction set for which rules will be mined from:

```
library('arules') contains Adult and AdultUCI datasets

data('Adult') # transaction set
arulesApp(Adult, vars=40)

data('AdultUCI') # data.frame
arulesApp(AdultUCI)
```

Here are the arguments:

- `dataset` data.frame, this is the dataset that association rules will be mined from. Each row is treated as a transaction. Seems to work OK when a the S4 transactions class from *arules* is used, however this is not thoroughly tested.

- `bin` logical, *TRUE* will automatically discretize/bin numerical data into categorical features that can be used for association analysis.

- `vars` integer, how many variables to include in initial rule mining

- `supp` numeric, the support parameter for initializing visualization. Useful when it is known that a high support is needed to not crash computationally.

- `conf` numeric, the confidence parameter for initializing visualization. Similarly useful when it is known that a high confidence is needed to not crash computationally.
