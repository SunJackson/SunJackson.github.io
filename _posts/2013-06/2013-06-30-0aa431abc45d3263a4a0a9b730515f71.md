A few weeks back, I was talking with my friend [Molly](http://mollybierman.tumblr.com/.) about personal domains and realized that her nickname, Bierface, was available. The exchange basically went like this:

> 
Me: I should buy bierface.com and just put up a ridiculous picture of you.
Molly: You would have to do a slideshow. Too many gems.


[So I did just that](http://www.bierface.com/.), switching randomly between 14 pictures every time the page is loaded. The laughs from it have been well worth the $10 spent purchasing the domain.

She started to question the randomness though. Here's what the code that loads each image looks like:

All we're doing is creating an empty *`<img>`* element, and then changing the src attribute of that element via JavaScript. The first line of JavaScript uses a combination of [Math.ceil()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil) and [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) to get a random integer between 1 and 14 (which are how the images are named). The second line uses that integer to create a file path and tells our *`<img>`* element to use that path as the src for the image.

Since the image is loaded by your web client, this seemed like a great opportunity to learn the very basics of grabbing client-side data - I could write some code to repeatedly get which image was loaded in order to determine how random *Math.random()* truly is.

#### The Setup

We're going to be using [Ghost.py](http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py) to simulate a [WebKit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) client. Ghost.py requires [PyQt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyQt) or [PySide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PySide), so you'll want to grab one of those, too. I'm on OSX 1.8.2 and using PySide 1.1.0 for Python 2.7, which you can get [here](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide_Binaries_MacOSX). You'll also need to grab Qt 4.7, which you can find [here](http://packages.kitware.com/item/3736).

#### The Code

With a little Python and Ghost.py, we can simulate a browser, allowing us to execute JavaScript telling us which image was loaded. We can also use [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to plot the distribution.

Let's walk though the code:

1. Load our libraries and create an instance of the Ghost class.

1. Store the JavaScript we'll need to execute in order to grab the image file name into a variable named *js*.

1. The comment should explain this one - we're initializing a zero'd out dictionary called *counts* so that our first plot doesn't have an x-axis with just one value. Each key of the dictionary will correspond to one of the images.

1. The [for loop](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) is used to run 1,000 simulations. My [xrange](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#xrange) usage is a little wacky because I'm using it to title and name the plots - typically *xrange* starts with 0 and runs up *until* the number specified (e.g. 1,001 will be the last loop, not 1,002).


This is the section that grabs which image was loaded by simulating a WebKit client with Ghost.py. This section does not get run on the first pass since we want to start with an empty plot.

1. Load bierface.com into our *page* variable.

1. Execute the JavaScript mentioned in #2 and store it in the *image* variable. Remember that this will be a string.

1. Split the *image* string so that we just grab the image number loaded.

1. Update our dictionary of counts for the given *image*.


Here we're using [matplotlib.pyplot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) to draw a bar chart. Thanks to [Jess Hamrick](http://www.jesshamrick.com/) for some awesome [plot-saving boilerplate](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/03/saving-figures-from-pyplot), which I'm using behind the *save* function.

#### The Results

*Math.random()* is pretty random (though #7 is the clear loser in the video below). It's easy to think it's not when working with a small sample size, but it's clear the numbers start to even out as the sample size increases.
