Executing Python statements from Javascript is one thing, but we'd
really like to be able to do something with the output.

In order to process the output of a Python statement executed in the kernel,
we need to add a callback function to the `execute` statement.
The full extent of callbacks is a bit involved, but the first step is
to set a callback which does something with the `output` attribute.

To set an output, we pass a Javascript callback object to the
execute call, looking like this:

```
var kernel = IPython.notebook.kernel;
function callback(out_type, out_data){
 // do_something
}
kernel.execute(command, {"output": callback});


```

Using this, we can execute a Python command and do something with
the result. The python command can be as simple as a variable name:
in this case, the value returned is simply the value of that variable.

To demonstrate this, we'll first import `pi` and `sin`
from the `math` package in Python:
