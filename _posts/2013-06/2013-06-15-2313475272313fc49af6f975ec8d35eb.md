** Sat 15 June 2013

 

I was graciously invited to give the keynote presentation at this year's PyCon Singapore. Luckily, I love to hack on long plane rides. See the slides from the talk below.

I showed some analytics on Python posts on Stackoverflow during the talk, [here is the IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/wesm/5786965/raw/ed219255583af7dea499577a134a9ff8625a6f25/gistfile1.txt). The raw data is [right here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3n4gyym1xjzdjfw/1QUflfXAsS).

I also gave a half day pandas tutorial, [here is the IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/wesm/5773719/raw/1399562c0a02b9edc3d13c71a70387a31d87260b/tutorial.ipynb). You will need the data to do it yourself, here's a [download link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zux0ed09j4fp5fy/tutorial_files.zip).
