**Wrangle, a new conference dedicated to the practice of data science from startup to enterprise, debuts in San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2015.**

Even as Cloudera introduce new tools for analytics and machine learning into its platform (like the recently announced Ibis project, for example), we are mindful of the fact that many of the hardest problems in data science cannot be solved by technology alone. From the smallest startups to the largest enterprises, we see companies struggling with how to acquire and manage new data sources, recruit and train the next generation of data scientists, and create a data-driven culture that crosses every level of the organization.

So, Cloudera is pleased to announce that on Oct. 22 in San Francisco, it is organizing and hosting the first-ever [Wrangle Conference](http://wrangleconf.com/.) (hashtag #wrangleconf), an single-day industry event that brings data science practitioners together to discuss how they approach the most difficult aspects of their work.

Wrangle has a top-notch program committee that includes the well-known practitioners Drew Conway, Clare Corthell, Beau Cronin, Monica Rogati, Peter Skomoroch, Sean Taylor, and Cloudera’s own Josh Wills, and will feature speakers from Capital One Labs, Facebook, Jawbone, Pinterest, Salesforce, Uber, and other data-rich companies to discuss:

- The state of the art in data measurement, management, and modeling in the real world

- How to recruit and lead data science teams during every phase of a company’s lifecycle

- Practices that promote a data-driven product strategy and culture


Plus, there will be some mighty fine BBQ there for all data wranglers in attendance to enjoy.

Registration for Wrangle is currently open by invitation only, with public access available soon. We’ll keep you posted!
