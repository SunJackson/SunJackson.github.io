LOGAN SQUARE — After little more than a year since Chicago launched its Divvy bikes network, the bike-sharing system is touting success as more than 1.6 million one-way trips have been taken around the city.

To help make sense of the complex Divvy bike data, Datascope Analytics [created an Interactive Divvy Traffic Pattern Map](http://divvy.datasco.pe/) searchable by individual stations citywide.

***Lizzie Schiffman explains how the Divvy data could be used to help move bicyclists around Chicago:***

Four stations along California Avenue in Logan Square and Humboldt Park, for example, show Divvy use to and from a number of citywide locations, many traveling along the Milwaukee Avenue corridor to Downtown.

But it appears the majority of Divvy bikes at the four Northwest Side locations are simply ridden within the same neighborhoods: Stations at California and Division Street as well as California and Milwaukee avenues show that the majority of rides are began and returned at the same station.

The California and Milwaukee station in particular is connected to the station at Damen and Pierce avenues. Logged rides show a direct line between Logan Square’s thriving commercial center to a station just south of the so-called Six Corners intersection in Wicker Park.

Of the 576 rides taken from the North and California station in Humboldt Park, the most were taken to Damen and Grand in West Town, followed by the Six Corners at Damen and Pierce, followed thirdly by trips taken to and from the same station.
