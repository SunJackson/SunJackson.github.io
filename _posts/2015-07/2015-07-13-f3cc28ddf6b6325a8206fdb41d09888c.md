### [](http://www.kennybastani.com/2015/07/spring-cloud-docker-microservices.html#start-the-cluster-with-docker-compose)Start the Cluster with Docker Compose

Now that each of the images has been built successfully, we can using Docker Compose to spin up our cluster. I’ve included a pre-configured Docker Compose yaml file with the project.

From the project root, navigate to the `spring-cloud-microservice-example/docker` directory.

Now, to startup the microservice cluster, run the following command:

If everything is configured correctly, each of the container images we built earlier will be launched within their own VM container on Docker and networked for automatic service discovery. You will see a flurry of log output from each of the services as they begin their startup sequence. This might take a few minutes to complete, depending on the performance of the machine you’re running this demo on.

Once the startup sequence is completed, you can navigate to the Eureka host and see which services have registered with the discovery service.

Copy and paste the following command into the terminal where Docker can be accessed using the `$DOCKER_HOST` environment variable.

If Eureka correctly started up, a browser window will open to the location of the Eureka service’s dashboard, as shown below.

We can see each of the service instances that are running and their status. We can then access one of the data-driven services, for example the `movie` service.

This command will navigate to the API gateway’s endpoint and proxy to the movie service’s REST API endpoints. These REST APIs have been configured to use [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS), which supports the auto-discovery of all of the service’s functionality as embedded links.
