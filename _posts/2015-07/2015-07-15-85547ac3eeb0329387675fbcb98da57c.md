Okay, yeah this is a really long line and it's not very readable. I kind of cheated to make this all in 15 lines.
This line is our **mating** process, and it's probably the most complicated part of a genetic algorithm. Let's start with the core of this nasty line. 

> `np.repeat(winners[:, x], ((params[0] - len(winners))/len(winners)), axis=0)` 


Basically np.repeat() will duplicate our 20x3 matrix to create a 80x3 matrix. We already populated the first 20 elements of nextPop with the winners from last generation. Now we want to populate the last 80 elements with their offspring.

> `np.random.permutation(np.repeat(winners[:, x], ((params[0] - len(winners))/len(winners)), axis=0))`


Now we just use np.random.permutation() to shuffle the columns of this next 80x3 matrix. This is how we accomplish the crossover functional. Imagine we have a 3x3 matrix (2 solutions) like this:`np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])` , when we run the permutation function, it will change it something like:`np.array([[7,5,3],[1,8,9],[4,2,3]])`
Go look at the numpy documentation to learn more about permutation if you still don't understand how it's working here.
