This month I have the honour of hosting the [Carnival of Mathematics](http://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/) *(Episode 125)*.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august12015/aperiodical.jpg)


*“What is this Carnival of which you speak?”* The Carnival is monthly blog round-up hosted by a different guest blogger each month. This rotating carnival gives bloggers a chance to cross-pollinate their readerships, and a chance to share stories, puzzles, anecdotes, reviews and comments.

To any new readers, welcome. To returning friends, welcome back.

### My Blog
|[![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august12015/blog.png)](http://datagenetics.com/blog.html)|I've been blogging now for about five years. I started off slowly, but now have a fairly regular cadence of publishing about four to five articles a month. If you like what you read, you can subscribe to a [newsletter alert service](http://datagenetics.com/newsletter/subscribe.html) (to receive an email when I publish a new article), or subscribe to my [RSS feed](http://datagenetics.com/feed/rss.xml).For a comprehensive list, see here for a [complete list of awesome articles!](http://datagenetics.com/blog.html)|

This is episode 125 of the Carnival, and it is traditional to start of with some little pieces of trivia about the number 125:

- 125 is the fifth perfect cube. 125 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 53.

125 is the third [Friedman number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_number) (in base 10). This means it can be represented by all its own digits using just the four basic arithmetic operators ( , − , × , ÷), additive inverses, parentheses, and exponents:
125 = 5(12)
Interestingly; 126, 127 and 128 are also Friedman numbers. This is the only time four consecutive numbers are Friedman numbers for four digits (or five, or six!)
126 = 6×21   127 = -127   128 = 2(8-1)
127 is also a 'nice' Friedman number because the digits in the solution occur in the same order as they do in the target.
Here's an example of a more complicated Friedman number, that has 125 in it (it's also nice).
210125 = (2101)2/5
Finally, here's a pandigital Friedman number. It uses all the digits 1-9 (by definition, on both sides!)
157326849 = 12543(7+9-6-8)
You can find more complete listings of Friedman numbers [here](http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0800.html).



It's the twelfth value in the [Tribonacci Sequence](http://oeis.org/A001590) (A001590) defined by T1=0, T2=1, T3=0.
0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, …
A Tribonacci Sequence is a generalization of a Fibonacci sequence, taken with 3 elements. *Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 + Tn-3*


125 can be expressed as a sum of two different sets of perfect squares.
125 = (102 + 52)    125 = (112 + 22)
125 and 126 form a [Ruth-Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth%E2%80%93Aaron_pair) pair. The sum of the prime factors of these consecutive numbers are the same.
Prime Factors (125) = 5 × 5 × 5
Prime Factors (126) = 2 × 3 × 3 × 7
5 + 5 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 3 +7
The Roman numerals for 125 is CXXV
CXXV
There is no word in the English language that contains the letters 'CXXV' in that order. In fact, there is no word that contains one 'C', two 'X's and one 'V' in any order!

Here are a couple of other references to 125 from popular culture:
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/august12015/ent.png)|In Star Trek, Species 125 was the Borg designation for a humanoid race which, by the 2360s, had been assimilated into the Collective. One notable member of Species 125 was the Borg Queen, who was first encountered by Captain Jean-Luc Picard in 2366, before the Battle of Wolf 359. In 2375, the Queen stated the designation of her species, when she kidnapped Seven of Nine. (Star Trek: First Contact; VOY: "Dark Frontier"). See here for [more details](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Species_125).|

The British Aerospace 125 is a twin-engine, low-wing, mid-size corporate jet. Originally developed by *de Havilland* and initially designated as the DH125 Jet Dragon, it entered production as the Hawker Siddeley HS-125. It features a perfectly cylindrical fuselage and a slightly swept wing.

The HS-125 has the dubious distinctions of being the only business jet to have ever been hijacked, and also being the only business jet to have survived being hit by an air-to-air missile! (Two separate incidents).
