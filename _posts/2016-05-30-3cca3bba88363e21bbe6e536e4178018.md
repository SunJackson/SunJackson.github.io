[Recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) have become a very important part of the retail, social networking, and entertainment industries. From providing advice on songs for you to try, suggesting books for you to read, or finding clothes to buy, recommender systems have greatly improved the ability of customers to make choices more easily.

Why is it so important for customers to have support in decision making? A well-cited study (over 2000 citations so far!) by [Iyengar and Lepper](https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20%282000%29.pdf) ran an experiment where they had two stands of jam on two different days. One stand had 24 varieties of jam while the second had only six. The stand with 24 varieties of jam only converted 3% of the customers to a sale, while the stand with only six varieties converted 30% of the customers. This was an increase in sales of nearly ten-fold!

Given the number of possible choices available, especially for online shopping, having some extra guidance on these choices can really make a difference. Xavier Amatriain, now at Quora and previously at Netflix, gave an absolutely outstanding talk on recommender systems at Carnegie Mellon in 2014. I have included the talk below if you would like to see it.

Some of the key statistics about recommender systems he notes are the following:

- At Netflix, 2/3 of the movies watched are recommended

- At Google, news recommendations improved click-through rate (CTR) by 38%

- For Amazon, 35% of sales come from recommendations


In addition, at Hulu, incorporating a recommender system improved their CTR by [three times](http://tech.hulu.com/blog/2011/09/19/recommendation-system) over just recommending the most popular shows back in 2011. When well implemented, recommender systems can give your company a great edge.

That doesn’t mean your company should necessarily build one, however. Valerie Coffman posted [this article](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/blog/2013/05/recommendation-engines-why-you-shouldnt-build-one) back in 2013, explaining that you need a fairly large amount of data on your customers and product purchases in order to have enough information for an effective recommender system. It’s not for everyone, but if you have enough data, it’s a good idea to consider it.

So, let’s assume you do have enough data on your customers and items to go about building one. How would you do it? Well, that depends a lot on several factors, such as:

- The kind of data you have about your users/items

- Ability to scale

- Recommendation transparency


I will cover a few of the options available and reveal the basic methodology behind each one.

### Content Based (Pandora)

In the case of Pandora, the online streaming music company, they decided to engineer features from all of the songs in their catalog as part of the [Music Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Genome_Project). Most songs are based on a feature vector of approximately 450 features, which were derived in a very long and arduous process. Once you have this feature set, one technique that works well enough is to treat the recommendation problem as a binary classification problem. This allows one to use more traditional machine learning techniques that output a probability for a certain user to like a specific song based on a training set of their song listening history. Then, simply recommend the songs with the greatest probability of being liked.

Most of the time, however, you aren’t going to have features already encoded for all of your products. This would be very difficult, and it took Pandora several years to finish so it probably won’t be a great option.

### Demographic Based (Facebook)

If you have a lot of demographic information about your users like Facebook or LinkedIn does, you may be able to recommend based on similar users and their past behavior. Similar to the content based method, you could derive a feature vector for each of your users and generate models that predict probabilities of liking certain items.

Again, this requires a lot of information about your users that you probably don’t have in most cases.

So if you need a method that doesn’t care about detailed information regarding your items or your users, collaborative filtering is a very powerful method that works with surprising efficacy.

## Collaborative Filtering

This is based on the relationship between users and items, with no information about the users or the items required! All you need is a rating of some kind for each user/item interaction that occurred where available. There are two kinds of data available for this type of interaction: explicit and implicit.

- Explicit: A score, such as a rating or a like

- Implicit: Not as obvious in terms of preference, such as a click, view, or purchase


The most common example discussed is movie ratings, which are given on a numeric scale. We can easily see whether a user enjoyed a movie based on the rating provided. The problem, however, is that most of the time, people don’t provide ratings at all (I am totally guilty of this on Netflix!), so the amount of data available is quite scarce. Netflix at least knows whether I watched something, which requires no further input on my part. It may be the case that I watched something but didn’t like it afterwards. So, it can be more difficult to infer whether this type of movie should be considered a positive recommendation or not.

Regardless of this disadvantage, implicit feedback is usually the way to go. Hulu, in a [blog post about their recommendation system](http://tech.hulu.com/blog/2011/09/19/recommendation-system) states:

> 
As the quantity of implicit data at Hulu far outweighs the amount of explicit feedback, our system should be designed primarily to work with implicit feedback data.


Since more data usually means a better model, implicit feedback is where our efforts should be focused. While there are a variety of ways to tackle collaborative filtering with implicit feedback, I will focus on the method included in Spark’s library used for collaborative filtering, alternating least squares (ALS).

### Alternating Least Squares

Before we start building our own recommender system on an example problem, I want to explain some of the intuition behind how this method works and why it likely is the only chosen method in Spark’s library. We discussed before how collaborative filtering doesn’t require any information about the users or items. Well, is there another way we can figure out how the users and the items are related to each other?

It turns out we can if we apply matrix factorization. Often, matrix factorization is applied in the realm of dimensionality reduction, where we are trying to reduce the number of features while still keeping the relevant information. This is the case with [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA) and the very similar [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD).

Essentially, can we take a large matrix of user/item interactions and figure out the latent (or hidden) features that relate them to each other in a much smaller matrix of user features and item features? That’s exactly what ALS is trying to do through matrix factorization.

As the image below demonstrates, let’s assume we have an original ratings matrix $R$ of size $MxN$, where $M$ is the number of users and $N$ is the number of items. This matrix is quite sparse, since most users only interact with a few items each. We can factorize this matrix into two separate smaller matrices: one with dimensions $MxK$ which will be our latent user feature vectors for each user $(U)$ and a second with dimensions $KxN$, which will have our latent item feature vectors for each item $(V)$. Multiplying these two feature matrices together approximates the original matrix, but now we have two matrices that are dense including a number of latent features $K$ for each of our items and users.

![](http://jmsteinw.github.io/images/Rec_images/ALS_Image_Test.png)


In order to solve for $U$ and $V$, we could either utilize SVD (which would require inverting a potentially very large matrix and be computationally expensive) to solve the factorization more precisely or apply ALS to approximate it. In the case of ALS, we only need to solve one feature vector at a time, which means it can be run in parallel! (This large advantage is probably why it is the method of choice for Spark). To do this, we can randomly initialize $U$ and solve for $V$. Then we can go back and solve for $U$ using our solution for $V$. Keep iterating back and forth like this until we get a convergence that approximates $R$ as best as we can.

After this has been finished, we can simply take the dot product of $U$ and $V$ to see what the predicted rating would be for a specific user/item interaction, even if there was no prior interaction. This basic methodology was adopted for implicit feedback problems in the paper [Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf) by Hu, Koren, and Volinsky. We will use this paper’s method on a real dataset and build our own recommender system.

## Processing the Data

The data we are using for this example comes from the infamous UCI Machine Learning repository. The dataset is called “Online Retail” and is found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail). As you can see in the description, this dataset contains all purchases made for an online retail company based in the UK during an eight month period.

We need to take all of the transactions for each customer and put these into a format ALS can use. This means we need each unique customer ID in the rows of the matrix, and each unique item ID in the columns of the matrix. The values of the matrix should be the total number of purchases for each item by each customer.

First, let’s load some libraries that will help us out with the preprocessing step. Pandas is always helpful!

```
import pandas as pd
import scipy.sparse as sparse
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve

```

The first step is to load the data in. Since the data is saved in an Excel file, we can use Pandas to load it.

```
website_url = 'http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx'
retail_data = pd.read_excel(website_url) # This may take a couple minutes

```

Now that the data has been loaded, we can see what is in it.

||InvoiceNo|StockCode|Description|Quantity|InvoiceDate|UnitPrice|CustomerID|Country
|------
|0|536365|85123A|WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER|6|2010-12-01 08:26:00|2.55|17850.0|United Kingdom|
|1|536365|71053|WHITE METAL LANTERN|6|2010-12-01 08:26:00|3.39|17850.0|United Kingdom|
|2|536365|84406B|CREAM CUPID HEARTS COAT HANGER|8|2010-12-01 08:26:00|2.75|17850.0|United Kingdom|
|3|536365|84029G|KNITTED UNION FLAG HOT WATER BOTTLE|6|2010-12-01 08:26:00|3.39|17850.0|United Kingdom|
|4|536365|84029E|RED WOOLLY HOTTIE WHITE HEART.|6|2010-12-01 08:26:00|3.39|17850.0|United Kingdom|

The dataset includes the invoice number for different purchases, along with the StockCode (or item ID), an item description, the number purchased, the date of purchase, the price of the items, a customer ID, and the country of origin for the customer.

Let’s check to see if there are any missing values in the data.

```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 541909 entries, 0 to 541908
Data columns (total 8 columns):
InvoiceNo 541909 non-null object
StockCode 541909 non-null object
Description 540455 non-null object
Quantity 541909 non-null int64
InvoiceDate 541909 non-null datetime64[ns]
UnitPrice 541909 non-null float64
CustomerID 406829 non-null float64
Country 541909 non-null object
dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(2), int64(1), object(4)
memory usage: 33.1+ MB

```

Most columns have no missing values, but Customer ID is missing in several rows. If the customer ID is missing, we don’t know who bought the item. We should drop these rows from our data first. We can use the pd.isnull to test for rows with missing data and only keep the rows that have a customer ID.

```
cleaned_retail = retail_data.loc[pd.isnull(retail_data.CustomerID) == False]

```

```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Int64Index: 406829 entries, 0 to 541908
Data columns (total 8 columns):
InvoiceNo 406829 non-null object
StockCode 406829 non-null object
Description 406829 non-null object
Quantity 406829 non-null int64
InvoiceDate 406829 non-null datetime64[ns]
UnitPrice 406829 non-null float64
CustomerID 406829 non-null float64
Country 406829 non-null object
dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(2), int64(1), object(4)
memory usage: 27.9+ MB

```

Much better. Now we have no missing values and all of the purchases can be matched to a specific customer.

Before we make any sort of ratings matrix, it would be nice to have a lookup table that keeps track of each item ID along with a description of that item. Let’s make that now.

```
item_lookup = cleaned_retail[['StockCode', 'Description']].drop_duplicates() # Only get unique item/description pairs
item_lookup['StockCode'] = item_lookup.StockCode.astype(str) # Encode as strings for future lookup ease

```

||StockCode|Description
|------
|0|85123A|WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER|
|1|71053|WHITE METAL LANTERN|
|2|84406B|CREAM CUPID HEARTS COAT HANGER|
|3|84029G|KNITTED UNION FLAG HOT WATER BOTTLE|
|4|84029E|RED WOOLLY HOTTIE WHITE HEART.|

This can tell us what each item is, such as that StockCode 71053 is a white metal lantern. Now that this has been created, we need to:

- Group purchase quantities together by stock code and item ID

- Change any sums that equal zero to one (this can happen if items were returned, but we want to indicate that the user actually purchased the item instead of assuming no interaction between the user and the item ever took place)

- Only include customers with a positive purchase total to eliminate possible errors

- Set up our sparse ratings matrix


This last step is especially important if you don’t want to have unnecessary memory issues! If you think about it, our matrix is going to contain thousands of items and thousands of users with a user/item value required for every possible combination. That is a LARGE matrix, so we can save a lot of memory by keeping the matrix sparse and only saving the locations and values of items that are not zero.

The code below will finish the preprocessing steps necessary for our final ratings sparse matrix:

```
cleaned_retail['CustomerID'] = cleaned_retail.CustomerID.astype(int) # Convert to int for customer ID
cleaned_retail = cleaned_retail[['StockCode', 'Quantity', 'CustomerID']] # Get rid of unnecessary info
grouped_cleaned = cleaned_retail.groupby(['CustomerID', 'StockCode']).sum().reset_index() # Group together
grouped_cleaned.Quantity.loc[grouped_cleaned.Quantity == 0] = 1 # Replace a sum of zero purchases with a one to
# indicate purchased
grouped_purchased = grouped_cleaned.query('Quantity > 0') # Only get customers where purchase totals were positive

```

If we look at our final resulting matrix of grouped purchases, we see the following:

```
grouped_purchased.head()

```

||CustomerID|StockCode|Quantity
|------
|0|12346|23166|1|
|1|12347|16008|24|
|2|12347|17021|36|
|3|12347|20665|6|
|4|12347|20719|40|

Instead of representing an explicit rating, the purchase quantity can represent a “confidence” in terms of how strong the interaction was. Items with a larger number of purchases by a customer can carry more weight in our ratings matrix of purchases.

Our last step is to create the sparse ratings matrix of users and items utilizing the code below:

```
customers = list(np.sort(grouped_purchased.CustomerID.unique())) # Get our unique customers
products = list(grouped_purchased.StockCode.unique()) # Get our unique products that were purchased
quantity = list(grouped_purchased.Quantity) # All of our purchases

rows = grouped_purchased.CustomerID.astype('category', categories = customers).cat.codes 
# Get the associated row indices
cols = grouped_purchased.StockCode.astype('category', categories = products).cat.codes 
# Get the associated column indices
purchases_sparse = sparse.csr_matrix((quantity, (rows, cols)), shape=(len(customers), len(products)))

```

Let’s check our final matrix object:

```
<4338x3664 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
with 266723 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

```

We have 4338 customers with 3664 items. For these user/item interactions, 266723 of these items had a purchase. In terms of sparsity of the matrix, that makes:

```
matrix_size = purchases_sparse.shape[0]*purchases_sparse.shape[1] # Number of possible interactions in the matrix
num_purchases = len(purchases_sparse.nonzero()[0]) # Number of items interacted with
sparsity = 100*(1 - (num_purchases/matrix_size))
sparsity

```

98.3% of the interaction matrix is sparse. For collaborative filtering to work, the maximum sparsity you could get away with would probably be about 99.5% or so. We are well below this, so we should be able to get decent results.

## Creating a Training and Validation Set

Typically in Machine Learning applications, we need to test whether the model we just trained is any good on new data it hasn’t yet seen before from the training phase. We do this by creating a test set completely separate from the training set. Usually this is fairly simple: just take a random sample of the training example rows in our feature matrix and separate it away from the training set. That normally looks like this:

![](http://jmsteinw.github.io/images/Rec_images/Traintest_ex.png)


With collaborative filtering, that’s not going to work because you need all of the user/item interactions to find the proper matrix factorization. A better method is to hide a certain percentage of the user/item interactions from the model during the training phase chosen at random. Then, check during the test phase how many of the items that were recommended the user actually ended up purchasing in the end. Ideally, you would ultimately test your recommendations with some kind of A/B test or utilizing data from a time series where all data prior to a certain point in time is used for training while data after a certain period of time is used for testing.

For this example, because the time period is only 8 months and because of the purchasing type (products), it is most likely products won’t be purchased again in a short time period anyway. This will be a better test. You can see an example here:

![](http://jmsteinw.github.io/images/Rec_images/MaskTrain.png)


Our test set is an exact copy of our original data. The training set, however, will mask a random percentage of user/item interactions and act as if the user never purchased the item (making it a sparse entry with a zero). We then check in the test set which items were recommended to the user that they ended up actually purchasing. If the users frequently ended up purchasing the items most recommended to them by the system, we can conclude the system seems to be working.

As an additional check, we can compare our system to simply recommending the most popular items to every user (beating popularity is a bit difficult). This will be our baseline.

This method of testing isn’t necessarily the “correct” answer, because it depends on how you want to use the recommender system. However, it is a practical way of testing performance I will use for this example.

Now that we have a plan on how to separate our training and testing sets, let’s create a function that can do this for us. We will also import the random library and set a seed so that you will see the same results as I did.

```
def make_train(ratings, pct_test = 0.2):
 '''
 This function will take in the original user-item matrix and "mask" a percentage of the original ratings where a
 user-item interaction has taken place for use as a test set. The test set will contain all of the original ratings, 
 while the training set replaces the specified percentage of them with a zero in the original ratings matrix. 
 
 parameters: 
 
 ratings - the original ratings matrix from which you want to generate a train/test set. Test is just a complete
 copy of the original set. This is in the form of a sparse csr_matrix. 
 
 pct_test - The percentage of user-item interactions where an interaction took place that you want to mask in the 
 training set for later comparison to the test set, which contains all of the original ratings. 
 
 returns:
 
 training_set - The altered version of the original data with a certain percentage of the user-item pairs 
 that originally had interaction set back to zero.
 
 test_set - A copy of the original ratings matrix, unaltered, so it can be used to see how the rank order 
 compares with the actual interactions.
 
 user_inds - From the randomly selected user-item indices, which user rows were altered in the training data.
 This will be necessary later when evaluating the performance via AUC.
 '''
 test_set = ratings.copy() # Make a copy of the original set to be the test set. 
 test_set[test_set != 0] = 1 # Store the test set as a binary preference matrix
 training_set = ratings.copy() # Make a copy of the original data we can alter as our training set. 
 nonzero_inds = training_set.nonzero() # Find the indices in the ratings data where an interaction exists
 nonzero_pairs = list(zip(nonzero_inds[0], nonzero_inds[1])) # Zip these pairs together of user,item index into list
 random.seed(0) # Set the random seed to zero for reproducibility
 num_samples = int(np.ceil(pct_test*len(nonzero_pairs))) # Round the number of samples needed to the nearest integer
 samples = random.sample(nonzero_pairs, num_samples) # Sample a random number of user-item pairs without replacement
 user_inds = [index[0] for index in samples] # Get the user row indices
 item_inds = [index[1] for index in samples] # Get the item column indices
 training_set[user_inds, item_inds] = 0 # Assign all of the randomly chosen user-item pairs to zero
 training_set.eliminate_zeros() # Get rid of zeros in sparse array storage after update to save space
 return training_set, test_set, list(set(user_inds)) # Output the unique list of user rows that were altered 

```

This will return our training set, a test set that has been binarized to 0/1 for purchased/not purchased, and a list of which users had at least one item masked. We will test the performance of the recommender system on these users only. I am masking 20% of the user/item interactions for this example.

```
product_train, product_test, product_users_altered = make_train(purchases_sparse, pct_test = 0.2)

```

Now that we have our train/test split, it is time to implement the alternating least squares algorithm from the Hu, Koren, and Volinsky paper.

## Implementing ALS for Implicit Feedback

Now that we have our training and test sets finished, we can move on to implementing the algorithm. If you look at the paper previously linked above

you can see the key equations will we need to implement into the algorithm. First, we have our ratings matrix which is sparse (represented by the product_train sparse matrix object). We need to turn this into a confidence matrix (from page 4):

\begin{equation} 
C_{ui} = 1 + \alpha r_{ui}
\end{equation}

Where $C_{ui}$ is the confidence matrix for our users $u$ and our items $i$. The $\alpha$ term represents a linear scaling of the rating preferences (in our case number of purchases) and the $r_{ui}$ term is our original matrix of purchases. The paper suggests 40 as a good starting point.

After taking the derivative of equation 3 in the paper, we can minimize the cost function for our users $U$:

\begin{equation} 
x_{u} = (Y^{T}C^{u}Y + \lambda I)^{-1}Y^{T}C^{u}p(u)
\end{equation}

The authors note you can speed up this computation through some linear algebra that changes this equation to:

\begin{equation} 
x_{u} = (Y^{T}Y + Y^{T}(C^{u}-I)Y + \lambda I)^{-1}Y^{T}C^{u}p(u)
\end{equation}

Notice that we can now precompute the $Y^{T}Y$ portion without having to iterate through each user $u$. We can derive a similar equation for our items:

\begin{equation} 
y_{i} = (X^{T}X + X^{T}(C^{i}-I)X + \lambda I)^{-1}X^{T}C^{i}p(i)
\end{equation}

These will be the two equations we will iterate back and forth between until they converge. We also have a regularization term $\lambda$ that can help prevent overfitting during the training stage as well, along with our binarized preference matrix $p$ which is just 1 where there was a purchase (or interaction) and zero where there was not.

Now that the math part is out of the way, we can turn this into code! Shoutout to [Chris Johnson’s implicit-mf](https://github.com/MrChrisJohnson/implicit-mf/blob/master/mf.py) code that was a helpful guide for this. I have altered his to make things easier to understand.

```
def implicit_weighted_ALS(training_set, lambda_val = 0.1, alpha = 40, iterations = 10, rank_size = 20, seed = 0):
 '''
 Implicit weighted ALS taken from Hu, Koren, and Volinsky 2008. Designed for alternating least squares and implicit

 alternating least squares. More iterations will allow better convergence at the cost of increased computation. 
 The authors found 10 iterations was sufficient, but more may be required to converge. 
 
 rank_size - The number of latent features in the user/item feature vectors. The paper recommends varying this 
 between 20-200. Increasing the number of features may overfit but could reduce bias. 
 
 seed - Set the seed for reproducible results
 
 returns:
 
 The feature vectors for users and items. The dot product of these feature vectors should give you the expected 
 "rating" at each point in your original matrix.

Hopefully the comments are enough to see how the code was structured. You want to keep the matrices sparse where possible to avoid memory issues! Let’s try just a single iteration of the code to see how it works (it’s pretty slow right now!) I will choose 20 latent factors as my rank matrix size along with an alpha of 15 and regularization of 0.1 (which I found in testing does the best). This takes about 90 seconds to run on my MacBook Pro.

```
user_vecs, item_vecs = implicit_weighted_ALS(product_train, lambda_val = 0.1, alpha = 15, iterations = 1,
 rank_size = 20)

```

We can investigate ratings for a particular user by taking the dot product between the user and item vectors ($U$ and $V$). Let’s look at our first user.

```
user_vecs[0,:].dot(item_vecs).toarray()[0,:5]

```

```
array([ 0.00644811, -0.0014369 , 0.00494281, 0.00027502, 0.01275582])

```

This is a sample of the first five items out of the 3664 in our stock. The first user in our matrix has the fifth item with the greatest recommendation out of the first five items. However, notice we only did one iteration because our algorithm was so slow! You should iterate at least ten times according to the authors so that $U$ and $V$ converge. We could wait 15 minutes to let this run, or . . . use someone else’s code that is much faster!

## Speeding Up ALS

This code in its raw form is just too slow. We have to do a lot of looping, and we haven’t taken advantage of the fact that our algorithm is embarrasingly parallel, since we could do each iteration of the item and user vectors independently. Fortunately, as I was still finishing this up, Ben Frederickson at Flipboard had perfect timing and came out with a version of ALS for Python utilizing Cython and parallelizing the code among threads. You can read his blog post about using it for finding similar music artists using matrix factorization [here](http://www.benfrederickson.com/matrix-factorization) and his implicit library [here](https://github.com/benfred/implicit). He claims it is even faster than Quora’s C++ [QMF](https://github.com/quora/qmf), but I haven’t tried theirs. All I can tell you is that it is over 1000 times faster than this bare bones pure Python version when I tested it. Install this library before you continue and follow the instructions. If you have conda installed, just do pip install implicit and you should be good to go.

First, import his library so we can utilize it for our matrix factorization.

His version of the code doesn’t have a parameter for the weighting $\alpha$ and assumes you are doing this to the ratings matrix before using it as an input. I did some testing and found the following settings to work the best. Also make sure that we set the type of our matrix to double for the ALS function to run properly.

```
alpha = 15
user_vecs, item_vecs = implicit.alternating_least_squares((product_train*alpha).astype('double'), 
 factors=20, 
 regularization = 0.1, 
 iterations = 50)

```

Much faster, right? We now have recommendations for all of our users and items. However, how do we know if these are any good?

## Evaluating the Recommender System

Remember that our training set had 20% of the purchases masked? This will allow us to evaluate the performance of our recommender system. Essentially, we need to see if the order of recommendations given for each user matches the items they ended up purchasing. A commonly used metric for this kind of problem is the area under the [Receiver Operating Characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) (or ROC) curve. A greater area under the curve means we are recommending items that end up being purchased near the top of the list of recommended items. Usually this metric is used in more typical binary classification problems to identify how well a model can predict a positive example vs. a negative one. It will also work well for our purposes of ranking recommendations.

In order to do that, we need to write a function that can calculate a mean area under the curve (AUC) for any user that had at least one masked item. As a benchmark, we will also calculate what the mean AUC would have been if we had simply recommended the most popular items. Popularity tends to be hard to beat in most recommender system problems, so it makes a good comparison.

First, let’s make a simple function that can calculate our AUC. Scikit-learn has one we can alter a bit.

```
from sklearn import metrics

```

```
def auc_score(predictions, test):
 '''
 This simple function will output the area under the curve using sklearn's metrics. 
 
 parameters:
 
 - predictions: your prediction output
 
 - test: the actual target result you are comparing to
 
 returns:
 
 - AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characterisic curve)
 '''
 fpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(test, predictions)
 return metrics.auc(fpr, tpr) 

```

Now, utilize this helper function inside of a second function that will calculate the AUC for each user in our training set that had at least one item masked. It should also calculate AUC for the most popular items for our users to compare.

```
def calc_mean_auc(training_set, altered_users, predictions, test_set):
 '''
 This function will calculate the mean AUC by user for any user that had their user-item matrix altered. 
 
 parameters:
 
 training_set - The training set resulting from make_train, where a certain percentage of the original
 user/item interactions are reset to zero to hide them from the model 
 
 predictions - The matrix of your predicted ratings for each user/item pair as output from the implicit MF.
 These should be stored in a list, with user vectors as item zero and item vectors as item one. 
 
 altered_users - The indices of the users where at least one user/item pair was altered from make_train function
 
 test_set - The test set constucted earlier from make_train function
 
 
 
 returns:
 
 The mean AUC (area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve) of the test set only on user-item interactions
 there were originally zero to test ranking ability in addition to the most popular items as a benchmark.
 '''
 
 
 store_auc = [] # An empty list to store the AUC for each user that had an item removed from the training set
 popularity_auc = [] # To store popular AUC scores
 pop_items = np.array(test_set.sum(axis = 0)).reshape(-1) # Get sum of item iteractions to find most popular
 item_vecs = predictions[1]
 for user in altered_users: # Iterate through each user that had an item altered
 training_row = training_set[user,:].toarray().reshape(-1) # Get the training set row
 zero_inds = np.where(training_row == 0) # Find where the interaction had not yet occurred
 # Get the predicted values based on our user/item vectors
 user_vec = predictions[0][user,:]
 pred = user_vec.dot(item_vecs).toarray()[0,zero_inds].reshape(-1)
 # Get only the items that were originally zero
 # Select all ratings from the MF prediction for this user that originally had no iteraction
 actual = test_set[user,:].toarray()[0,zero_inds].reshape(-1) 
 # Select the binarized yes/no interaction pairs from the original full data
 # that align with the same pairs in training 
 pop = pop_items[zero_inds] # Get the item popularity for our chosen items
 store_auc.append(auc_score(pred, actual)) # Calculate AUC for the given user and store
 popularity_auc.append(auc_score(pop, actual)) # Calculate AUC using most popular and score
 # End users iteration
 
 return float('%.3f'%np.mean(store_auc)), float('%.3f'%np.mean(popularity_auc)) 
 # Return the mean AUC rounded to three decimal places for both test and popularity benchmark

```

We can now use this function to see how our recommender system is doing. To use this function, we will need to transform our output from the ALS function to csr_matrix format and transpose the item vectors. The original pure Python version output the user and item vectors into the correct format already.

```
calc_mean_auc(product_train, product_users_altered, 
 [sparse.csr_matrix(user_vecs), sparse.csr_matrix(item_vecs.T)], product_test)
# AUC for our recommender system

```

We can see that our recommender system beat popularity. Our system had a mean AUC of 0.87, while the popular item benchmark had a lower AUC of 0.814. You can go back and tune the hyperparameters if you wish to see if you can get a higher AUC score. Ideally, you would have separate train, cross-validation, and test sets so that you aren’t overfitting while tuning the hyperparameters, but this setup is adequate to demonstrate how to check that the system is working.

## A Recommendation Example

We now have our recommender system trained and have proven it beats the benchmark of popularity. An AUC of 0.87 means the system is recommending items the user in fact had purchased in the test set far more frequently than items the user never ended up purchasing. To see an example of how it works, let’s examine the recommendations given to a particular user and decide subjectively if they make any sense.

First, however, we need to find a way of retrieving the items already purchased by a user in the training set. Initially, we will create an array of our customers and items we made earlier.

```
customers_arr = np.array(customers) # Array of customer IDs from the ratings matrix
products_arr = np.array(products) # Array of product IDs from the ratings matrix

```

Now, we can create a function that will return a list of the item descriptions from our earlier created item lookup table.

```
def get_items_purchased(customer_id, mf_train, customers_list, products_list, item_lookup):
 '''
 This just tells me which items have been already purchased by a specific user in the training set. 
 
 parameters: 
 
 customer_id - Input the customer's id number that you want to see prior purchases of at least once
 
 mf_train - The initial ratings training set used (without weights applied)
 
 customers_list - The array of customers used in the ratings matrix
 
 products_list - The array of products used in the ratings matrix
 
 item_lookup - A simple pandas dataframe of the unique product ID/product descriptions available
 
 returns:
 
 A list of item IDs and item descriptions for a particular customer that were already purchased in the training set
 '''
 cust_ind = np.where(customers_list == customer_id)[0][0] # Returns the index row of our customer id
 purchased_ind = mf_train[cust_ind,:].nonzero()[1] # Get column indices of purchased items
 prod_codes = products_list[purchased_ind] # Get the stock codes for our purchased items
 return item_lookup.loc[item_lookup.StockCode.isin(prod_codes)]

```

We need to look these up by a customer’s ID. Looking at the list of customers:

```
array([12346, 12347, 12348, 12349, 12350])

```

we can see that the first customer listed has an ID of 12346. Let’s examine their purchases from the training set.

```
get_items_purchased(12346, product_train, customers_arr, products_arr, item_lookup)

```

||StockCode|Description
|------
|61619|23166|MEDIUM CERAMIC TOP STORAGE JAR|

We can see that the customer purchased a ceramic jar for storage, medium size. What items does the recommender system say this customer should purchase? We need to create another function that does this. Let’s also import the MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn to help with this.

```
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

```

```
def rec_items(customer_id, mf_train, user_vecs, item_vecs, customer_list, item_list, item_lookup, num_items = 10):
 '''
 This function will return the top recommended items to our users 
 
 parameters:
 
 customer_id - Input the customer's id number that you want to get recommendations for
 
 mf_train - The training matrix you used for matrix factorization fitting
 
 user_vecs - the user vectors from your fitted matrix factorization
 
 item_vecs - the item vectors from your fitted matrix factorization
 
 customer_list - an array of the customer's ID numbers that make up the rows of your ratings matrix 
 (in order of matrix)
 
 item_list - an array of the products that make up the columns of your ratings matrix
 (in order of matrix)
 
 item_lookup - A simple pandas dataframe of the unique product ID/product descriptions available
 
 num_items - The number of items you want to recommend in order of best recommendations. Default is 10. 
 
 returns:
 
 - The top n recommendations chosen based on the user/item vectors for items never interacted with/purchased
 '''
 
 cust_ind = np.where(customer_list == customer_id)[0][0] # Returns the index row of our customer id
 pref_vec = mf_train[cust_ind,:].toarray() # Get the ratings from the training set ratings matrix
 pref_vec = pref_vec.reshape(-1) + 1 # Add 1 to everything, so that items not purchased yet become equal to 1
 pref_vec[pref_vec > 1] = 0 # Make everything already purchased zero
 rec_vector = user_vecs[cust_ind,:].dot(item_vecs.T) # Get dot product of user vector and all item vectors
 # Scale this recommendation vector between 0 and 1
 min_max = MinMaxScaler()
 rec_vector_scaled = min_max.fit_transform(rec_vector.reshape(-1,1))[:,0] 
 recommend_vector = pref_vec*rec_vector_scaled 
 # Items already purchased have their recommendation multiplied by zero
 product_idx = np.argsort(recommend_vector)[::-1][:num_items] # Sort the indices of the items into order 
 # of best recommendations
 rec_list = [] # start empty list to store items
 for index in product_idx:
 code = item_list[index]
 rec_list.append([code, item_lookup.Description.loc[item_lookup.StockCode == code].iloc[0]]) 
 # Append our descriptions to the list
 codes = [item[0] for item in rec_list]
 descriptions = [item[1] for item in rec_list]
 final_frame = pd.DataFrame({'StockCode': codes, 'Description': descriptions}) # Create a dataframe 
 return final_frame[['StockCode', 'Description']] # Switch order of columns around

```

Essentially, this will retrieve the $N$ highest ranking dot products between our user and item vectors for a particular user. Items already purchased are not recommended to the user. For now, let’s use a default of 10 items and see what the recommender system decides to pick for our customer.

```
rec_items(12346, product_train, user_vecs, item_vecs, customers_arr, products_arr, item_lookup,
 num_items = 10)

```

||StockCode|Description
|------
|0|23167|SMALL CERAMIC TOP STORAGE JAR|

These recommendations seem quite good! Remember that the recommendation system has no real understanding of what a ceramic jar is. All it knows is the purchase history. It identified that people purchasing a medium sized jar may also want to purchase jars of a differing size. The recommender system also suggests jar magnets and a sugar dispenser, which is similar in use to a storage jar. I personally was blown away by how well the system seems to pick up on these sorts of shopping patterns. Let’s try another user that hasn’t made a large number of purchases.

```
get_items_purchased(12353, product_train, customers_arr, products_arr, item_lookup)

```

This person seems like they want to make cakes. What kind of items does the recommender system think they would be interested in?

```

 num_items = 10)

```

```

## Summary

In this post, we have learned about how to design a recommender system with implicit feedback and how to provide recommendations. We also covered how to test the recommender system.

In real life, if the size of your ratings matrix will not fit on a single machine very easily, utilizing the implementation in [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html) is going to be more practical. If you are interested in taking recommender systems to the next level, a hybrid system would be best that incorporates information about your users/items along with the purchase history. A Python library called LightFM from Maciej Kula at Lyst looks very interesting for this sort of application. You can find it [here](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm).

Last, there are several other advanced methods you can incorporate in recommender systems to get a bump in performance. Part 2 of Xavier Amatriain’s lecture would be a great place to [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRToFXlNBpQ).

If you are more interested in recommender systems with explicit feedback (such as with movie reviews) there are a couple of great posts that cover this in detail:
