 Data Integrity and Normalization

 Umesh Hodeghatta Rao, CTO, Nu-Sigma Analytics Labs Webcast: Data Integrity & Normalization
 AI Machine Learning model accuracy depends on the quality of data. In data science, when we say quality of data, it means data consistency, data completeness and data correctness which are all part of data integrity. For example, in case of some of the machine learning models, we assume data is normally distributed or data elements are appropriately scaled. However, it is not always true. Hence, data has to be transformed by normalizing data without losing its integrity. This is a big challenge in data science. Data integrity is maintained with the help of integrity constraints or the rules that are designed to keep data consistent and correct. In this session we will discuss some of the techniques and methods used for data transformation and normalization while ensuring data integrity. We will walk you through the steps involved with the help of examples.

 Jeremy Gu, Sr. Data Scientist, Uber
 In order to accelerate innovation and learning, the data science team at Uber is looking to optimize Driver, Rider, Eater, Restaurant and Courier experience through reinforcement learning methods.The team has implemented bandits methods of optimization which learn iteratively and rapidly from a continuous evaluation of related metric performance. Recently, we completed an AI-powered experiment using bandits techniques for content optimization to improve the customer engagement. The technique helped improve customer experience compared to any classic hypothesis testing methods.In this session, we will explain various use cases at Uber that this technique has proven its value and how bandits have helped optimize and improve customer experience and engagement at Uber.

 Robin Gareiss, President & Founder, Nemertes Research
 At most organizations, conference rooms are less than perfect--and that affects the productivity of any meeting. Inconsistency is the cornerstone of meeting room space, whether its the power outlet locations, wired or wireless connectivity, brand of digital whiteboard, or video conferencing capabilities. Thats why many companies are investing in "Conference Room of the Future" initiatives. Nemertes recently conducted research among 600+ global organizations, and this webinar will focus on best practices. It will address the following: • What technologies are crucial to effective meetings?• Who should run the meeting-room overhauls for the most success --IT or facilities?• What are the differences between smaller, huddle rooms and large conference rooms, in terms of user expectations?• How do advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, play a role in meeting rooms?• What should IT leaders look for in management and monitoring tools?We look forward to sharing this information with you and answering your questions!

 Kirk Borne, Principal Data Scientist, Booz Allen Hamilton & Andreas Blumauer, CEO, Managing Partner Semantic Web Company
 Implementing AI applications based on machine learning is a significant topic for organizations embracing digital transformation. By 2020, 30% of CIOs will include AI in their top five investment priorities according to Gartner’s Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018: Intelligent Apps and Analytics. But to deliver on the AI promise, organizations need to generate good quality data to train the algorithms. Failure to do so will result in the following scenario: "When you automate a mess, you get an automated mess."This webinar covers: - An introduction to machine learning use cases and challenges provided by Kirk Borne, Principal Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton and top data science and big data influencer.- How to achieve good data quality based on harmonized semantic metadata presented by Andreas Blumauer, CEO and co-founder of Semantic Web Company and a pioneer in the application of semantic web standards for enterprise data integration.- How to apply a combined approach when semantic knowledge models and machine learning build the basis of your cognitive computing. (See Attachment: The Knowledge Graph as the Default Data Model for Machine Learning)- Why a combination of machine and human computation approaches is required, not only from an ethical but also from a technical perspective.

 Intelligent Agents and a New Class of Perceived Errors

 Dennis R. Mortensen, CEO and Founder, x.ai
 As we move to the conversational UI and take advantage of NLP and AI in general, we change the way we interact with technology dramatically. The standard GUI is many times fully eliminated, leading to novel challenges in UX. Tasks are removed from the user’s oversight with invisible or seamless software, and the output is not always as expected. But sometimes that output is correct within the parameters given and simply perceived as an error. Dennis will talk through where x.ai has encountered error perception issues as we seek to develop frictionless software, how we thought about the problem and the communication strategies we’re exploring to resolve it.
