Sketch by Dean Malmgren


We’ve written a lot about the importance of using the design
process to identify the [right](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/how-might-we) [problem](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/design-math-and-data) [to](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/data-human-centered-design) [solve](https://datascopeanalytics.com/press/creative-thinking-and-data-science).
But when we’re asked “what tools do you use?”, we often
skirt the question by reinforcing how we choose our tools and data sets based
on the problems that we face or by describing the tools we’ve used for
specific projects.

Our avoidance is deliberate. At Datascope, we don’t believe you can
solve every problem with the same tool every single time. In our experience,
we often discover new tools to use or develop a custom tool during the course
of a project. But we nonetheless appreciate the essence of the question, which
is really “how do you build your solutions?”

To reiterate, we do not have a standardized approach, but one thing
we’ve become quite good at over the years is in our ability to weave
together various open source packages to craft data-driven solutions. Keeping
the bigger picture in mind, we aggregate data from a variety of sources,
choose an appropriate method of storage, build a scalable analysis, and design
visualizations that meet our client’s use cases.

When the existing tool set does not meet our needs, we don’t force a
square peg in a round hole. We either adapt and patch existing tools to meet
our needs (e.g., fork an open source project), create a new open source tool
(e.g., [catcorr.js](https://github.com/ideo/catcorrjs) or
[textract](http://textract.readthedocs.org/)), or build a new
proprietary tool specifically for our clients (e.g., our work for

Daegis).

For a beginner, it is really hard to know how you can use all of these
tools and, perhaps more importantly, how they all fit together. To help people
get started, we created a visualization of
the landscape of open source data science tools and recorded a webinar on how all these
tools fit together. If you find the visualization useful or would like to
contribute a tool that we’ve missed, we hope you’ll consider
participating in the ongoing support of the project!
