See the prior 3 posts for context:

This one takes a long time to load. It makes a `d3.csv` call to a 24MB file. I was surprised to find that reading in the file took 
all this time, but transformations that happen in the app take almost no time at all.

### One week of Next Bus predictions

The scatter plot with zoom+pan+brush loaded too slow with the full dataset (24MB) of all 190,000 predictions for the week.
It also made for a crowded visualization. So I took a sample preserving a consistent distance between predictions. The sampled data (2.5MB) takes every 10th prediction which turns out to be approximately a prediction every 90 seconds.

```
# keeping just estimates every nth prediction when time between predictions is less than 30 seconds
df$timediff[2:nrow(df)] <- df$time[2:nrow(df)] - df$time[1:(nrow(df)-1)]
df$timediff[is.na(df$timediff)] <- 0
n <- 10
df$timediffSample[df$timediff<30] <- rep(1:n, length.out=sum(df$timediff<30))
df$timediffSample[is.na(df$timediffSample)] <- 0
```
