We love pair programming here at Datascope. It helps us write more
elegant and reliable code
while reducing
the time it takes to program. Some research suggests
that pair
programmers are happier than people who work alone, and leading
companies all over the world are now jumping on the pair programming
bandwagon. 

We're taking pair programming to a whole new
level thanks to a partnership with students at Northwestern
University's McCormick School of Engineering and
Applied Science. Throughout the spring of 2014, we worked with four
engineering students to create a new workspace specifically designed
for the way we program. Here's what they have to say
about their creation!

Despite decades of design and rethinking, desks haven't changed
that much since they were invented in medieval times. They're still
flat, roughly rectangular surfaces around waist height, with important
things placed on top of them. And despite some noteworthy attempts to
make them more collaborative, modern workspaces have yet to stray far
from the original, solo-user design. We sought to change that by
creating a pair programming station uniquely designed to fit the needs
of a team, one that would join in on the action rather than simply
supporting it at a comfortable height.

Through research and testing, we came to understand our design
problem as one of communication; our design streamlines a triangle of
communication between two programmers and a single computer, allowing
all three to be involved in the process of coding simultaneously. Our
final prototype, the DuoDesk, is an elliptical workstation with
integrated circuitry that adapts a single-user computer interface into
a pair-centric alternative. Users can alternate control of the
computer through the desk's built in lights and USB
switch, spending less time working around the limitations of their
setup, and more time doing what they want to:
programming. Here's how it works.

## Elliptical Tabletop

The elliptical tabletop serves as both the work surface and
connecting structure for the rest of the design. Its shape is designed
to provide adequate surface space for each user while maintaining
optimal angles between both users and the central monitor. By varying
the ratio between the long and short dimensions of the ellipse, we
were able to optimize sitting angles into a position comfortable for
both users. A flatter profile points the users more towards the
monitor, whereas a rounder one angles them towards each other. This
particular desk features a 3 to 5 ratio between the short and long
sides of the ellipse, as well as a rectangular region in back to
increase the surface area. We chose to make the tabletop out of birch
plywood because if it's high strength to weight ratio and appealing
surface quality.

## Electrical Backsplash

Mounted in front of the monitor, this short, vertical surface
provides a place to put post-it notes (something the users at
Datascope specifically requested) and serves as home base for our
electrical panel and interface indicator lights. The whole backsplash
was laser-cut from a single sheet of plywood in
Northwestern's prototyping laboratory. 

We designed the electrical panel based on feedback from one of our
user testing sessions. This critical feature of the workstation
automatically distributes and retracts 2 Mac chargers, a USB cable and
a HDMI cable through special slots that allow them to slide without
letting the head slip through. Once a cord is released, it retracts
back behind the desk based on gravity alone, so it can't clutter up
the workspace. The electrical panel is made from frosted acrylic
plastic, and was laser cut to shape. We incorporated a standard 120
volt outlet into the panel, increasing the flexibility of the design
to allow it to charge phones and other accessories. Everything else is
powered by a bank of outlets hidden underneath the desk. Finally, the
backsplash also houses the driver-lights on either side of the
electrical panel. These banks of LED's indicate which programmer has
control of the computer at the moment.

## Driver Switch


![](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/introducing-the-duodesk/image05.png)

In pair programming, one programmer is called the
“driver,” while the other is known as the
“navigator.” The driver writes the code, while the
navigator reviews it. Before we designed the DuoDesk, the programmers
at Datascope would have to physically pass a single keyboard and mouse
back and forth to switch driver and navigator roles. Our new driver
switch lets each user keep their favorite keyboard in front of them by
turning on only one person's keyboard a time. When the pair wants to
switch roles, they simply push the switch towards the new driver,
which activates the new driver's keyboard while deactivating the
navigator's. The switch also indicates who is in control through a
system of lights on the electrical panel. Red means stop; green means
go. When you become the driver, your side gets the green light.


This dual-action design facilitates communication between the two
users, as it provides a very overt signal as to when control has been
shifted. Never again will programmers at Datascope have to share a
single keyboard or try to guess who is in control.

## Caster Wheels

All three legs rest on low-profile caster wheels, making the entire
device portable. We used the lathes in Northwestern's machine shop to
make special adapters which allow the casters to plug directly into
the table legs' threaded leveling mechanisms.


Datascope values flexibility as a company, a trait visible
throughout their downtown Chicago workspace. Rolling desks and
whiteboards float around the office on a daily basis, covered with a
sea of constantly shifting notes. Our easily moved desk fits with this
ideal of corporate flexibility, as well as offering more tangible
benefits like allowing programmers to escape the sun's glare.
