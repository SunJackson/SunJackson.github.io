Every new employee of Datascope goes through an onboarding process for the
first three months, a big part of which is a self-defined project. This
approach has several goals:

positioning new team members to learning new
things
- giving everyone an opportunity to collaborate

giving
us all some fun project to work on for the next three months while

giving us something to share with the world

Additionally, given my robotics
background, we decided I would try on something where I collect and analyze
real data from real sensors.

Keeping these goals in mind, how does one come up with an awesome topic,
one that is cool enough, doable enough, challenging enough, and dare I say,
extreme enough? A tough creative challenge, perfectly suited for a brainstorm!
And one of the most important parts of brainstorming, as I came to learn, is

suspending judgement of other people’s ideas, as this leads to
free association and gives a significant boost to the creativity of the
session.

Because a key goal of the project is for me to learn how to work with
sensor data, we started the conversation by filling the left hand side of the
whiteboard with all the possible sensors we could use for this project: GPS,
temperature, pressure, force, accelerometers, gyros, acidity, RFID scanners
(or anything you can your hands on at [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/)).
At times, we delved into what
I thought was likely unhelpful, including microwave antennas and Geiger
counters, but these ideas sparked ideas for other sensors, like microphones
and cameras. It was really exciting to see how suspending judgement helped the
creative process. As an added benefit, it would definitely be amusing to
examine this:

After setting the stage with a broad set of sensors that we
could use, we started throwing ideas at the board in the form of
post-its (this was new to me, but holy shit can these guys cram a lot on
one post-it) for different ways we could use sensors to measure something
interesting that could be analyzed and visualized in three months. Toward the end,
some common themes emerged and we reorganized the post-its into these broader
themes and ended up with something like this:

As an avid 
rock [climber](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9m9hp6le2431mig/560254_716991311841_2033851347_n.jpg?dl=0),
one of the large idea clusters that came out of the brainstorm involved
designing rock climbing gear. Most of these ideas revolved around adding a
force/shear sensor in the climbing shoes and processing the recorded data to
help climbers train better and improve their footwork. As the person who would
wear said shoes, I wasn’t terribly excited about this idea, but my
judgement was suspended so who was I to critique.

There were plenty more ideas, ranging from making a Datascoper’s
house safer against burglary to studying the efficacy of different plant
fertilizers. These were suggestions like tracking our coffee consumption and
correlating it with our productivity or figuring out when the train arrives at
the station outside our window. In fact, a large amount of post-its
displayed cute drawings of (CTA) trains.

Just then, as we were listening for the train, a taxi-cab traffic tie up
below was generating a barrage of car honks. The intersection of Adams and
Wells is a very busy one, and it creates quite a bit of traffic noise. The
serendipitous honking immediately shifted everyone’s thinking: could we
use the traffic noise to somehow gain some interesting insights? Several ideas
quickly emerged, among which:  

‘

> 
allow and encourage all ideas, no matter how outlandish,
as they will eventually give rise to solid and exciting topics


categorize honks by make and model of vehicle and then figure out which
type of car honks the most[[1]](https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/a-taxis-suspension-of-judgement#fn-1)
look at the length of each honk and correlate it with the time of day,
figuring out when road rage tends to manifest itself
find the honk pattern that people use the most: two short beeps and one
long, three long ones followed by a short beep, or maybe most stop after a
short beep
place sensors at different geographical locations and see if this
“vocabulary” changes based on neighborhood, city or
country

So by suspending judgement, we were able to come up with a project that I
was really excited about that can accomplish all of the goals we set out to
achieve. What started as geiger counters and anti-burglary systems, turned
into measuring my climbing routine, and transitioned into listening to trains
and quantifying honking vocabulary. Lesson learned: allow and encourage all
ideas, no matter how outlandish, as they will eventually give rise to solid
and exciting topics.
