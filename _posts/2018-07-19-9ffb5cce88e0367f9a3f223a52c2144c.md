In this article we show how to produce [interactive 3D visualization of datasets](http://fastml.com/interactive-in-browser-3d-visualization-of-datasets). These are very good visualizations. The best, really.

Now, you can use [Cubert](http://cubert.fastml.com/.) to make these beauties. However, if you’re more of a do-it-yourself type, here’s a HOWTO.










Let’s say you’ve performed dimensionality reduction with a method of your choosing and have some data points looking like this:

```
cid,x,y,z
1.0,0.131364496515,-0.590685372085,-1.00062387318
-1.0,-1.90206919581,-0.0518527188196,-1.01665336703
1.0,2.29749236265,-0.982830132008,0.0511009011955

```

First goes the class label and then the three dimensions. The software we use, [data-projector](https://github.com/datacratic/data-projector), needs a JSON file:

```
{"points": [
 {"y": "-79.0866574", "x": "-3.15971493", "z": "-98.5084333", "cid": "1.0"}, 
 {"y": "-50.3503514", "x": "-100.0", "z": "-100.0", "cid": "0.0"}, 
 {"y": "-100.0", "x": "100.0", "z": "-0.643983041", "cid": "1.0"}
]}

```

The dimensions in the cube go from -100 to 100, so we rescale the data accordingly:

```
d = pd.read_csv( input_file )
assert set( d.columns ) == set([ 'cid', 'x', 'y', 'z' ])

scaler = MinMaxScaler( feature_range=( -100, 100 ))
d[[ 'x', 'y', 'z' ]] = scaler.fit_transform( d[[ 'x', 'y', 'z' ]])

```

If our labels are in order (starting from 0), we’re ready to save to JSON:

```
d_json = { 'points': json.loads( d.astype( str ).to_json( None, orient= 'records' )) }
json.dump( d_json, open( output_file, 'wb' ))

```

Why the acrobatics in the first line? We could save directly with:

```
d.astype( str ).to_json( output_file, orient = 'records' )

```

The reason is that we need to wrap the data in a dictionary with one key called ‘points’. Therefore, we:

- convert the data frame to json to a string

- load it into a JSON object

- dump the object to a file


The complete [code](https://github.com/zygmuntz/cubert) is available at GitHub.

Now move `data.json` to the `data-projector` directory and open `index.html` with your browser. That is, if your browser happens to be Firefox.

If you’re using Chrome, you’ll need to access `index.html` through HTTP, because apparently Chrome policy doesn’t allow loading data from external files when opening a file from a local disk.

Yasser Souri gives one solution:

- open a console and in the `data-projector` directory

- type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` (assuming python 2.x)

- open *http://localhost* in your browser
