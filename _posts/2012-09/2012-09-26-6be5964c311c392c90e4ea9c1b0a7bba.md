A while ago I posted some information on the new matplotlib animation
package (see my tutorial
[here](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial) and
a followup post [here](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python)). In them, I show
how easy it is to use matplotlib to create simple animations.

This morning I came across this cool optical illusion on
[gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5945194/this-optical-trick-is-annoying-the-hell-out-of-me)

It intrigued me, so I decided to see if I could create it using matplotlib.
Using my previous template and a bit of geometry, I was able to finish it
before breakfast! Here's the code:

And here's the result:




This just confirms my suspicion that a few lines of python really can do
anything.
