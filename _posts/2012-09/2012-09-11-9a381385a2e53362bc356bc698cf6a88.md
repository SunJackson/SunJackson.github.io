This Friday (9/14)  I will be at [Big Data Innovation](http://analytics.theiegroup.com/bigdata-boston) talking about how Tripadvisor for Business models subscriber happiness and what we can do to improve a subscriber's probability of renewal.

On October 1 and 2 I will be at [Predictive Analytics World](http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/boston/2012) in Boston. This has become my favorite data mining conference. On the Monday, I will be visiting with my friends at JMP and giving a sponsored talk about how we use JMP for cannibalization analysis at Tripadvisor for Business. On Tuesday, I will go into the details of that analysis in more detail in a regular conference talk.
