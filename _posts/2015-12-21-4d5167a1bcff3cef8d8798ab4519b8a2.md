*Note: The video is the interview only. The audio podcast has the intro, interview, and data science learning club activity explanation.*

In this episode we meet [Will Kurt](https://twitter.com/willkurt), who talks about his path from English & Literature and Library & Information Science degrees to becoming the Lead Data Scientist at KISSmetrics. He also tells us about his probability blog, [Count Bayesie](https://www.countbayesie.com/), and I introduce Data Science Learning Club Activity 1. Will has some great advice for people learning data science!
