It often doesn’t take much to get me off track, and on a holiday weekend…well, I was just begging for a fun way to shirk. Enter Harlan Harris:

Hey, I’m someone looking for something to do! And I like writing Julia code! So let’s have a look at recreating this diagram in Julia using VennEuler.jl ([IJulia Notebook link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/randyzwitch/860e1d9ae5a12cb61b1b)):

## Installing VennEuler.jl

Because VennEuler.jl is not in METADATA as of the time of writing, instead of using Pkg.add() you’ll need to run:

```
|1
|Pkg.clone("https://github.com/HarlanH/VennEuler.jl.git")

```

Note that VennEuler uses some of the more exotic packages (at least to me) like NLopt and Cairo, so you might need to have a few additional dependencies installed with the package.

## Data

The data was a bit confusing to me at first, since the percentages add up to more than 100% (people could vote multiple times). In order to create a dataset to use, I took the percentages, multiplied by 1000, then re-created the voting pattern. The data for the graph can be downloaded from [this link](http://randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kdnuggets_language_survey_2014.csv).

## Code - Circles

With a few modifications, I basically re-purposed Harlan’s code from the [package test files](https://github.com/HarlanH/VennEuler.jl/blob/master/test/DC2.jl). The circle result is as follows:

```
|1

3

|using VennEuler

data, labels = readcsv("/home/rzwitch/Desktop/kdnuggets_language_survey_2014.csv", header=true)
data = bool(data)
labels = vec(labels)

#Circles
eo = make_euler_object(labels, data, EulerSpec()) # circles, for now

(minf,minx,ret) = optimize(eo, random_state(eo), ftol=-1, xtol=0.0025, maxtime=120, pop=1000)
println("got $minf at $minx (returned $ret)")

render("/home/rzwitch/Desktop/kd.svg", eo, minx)

```

Since the percentage of R, SAS, and Python users isn’t too dramatically different (`49.81%`, `33.42%`, `40.97%` respectively) and the visualizations are circles, it’s a bit hard to tell that R is about 16% points higher than SAS and 9% points higher than Python.

## Code - Rectangles

Alternatively, we can use rectangles to represent the areas:

```
|1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16

18
|using VennEuler

data, labels = readcsv("/home/rzwitch/Desktop/kdnuggets_language_survey_2014.csv", header=true)
data = bool(data)
labels = vec(labels)

# Rectangles
eo = make_euler_object(labels, data, [EulerSpec(:rectangle), EulerSpec(:rectangle, [.5, .5, .4], [0, 0, 0]),
 EulerSpec(:rectangle)],
 sizesum=.3)


(minf,minx,ret) = optimize_iteratively(eo, random_state(eo), ftol=-1, xtol=0.0025, maxtime=5, pop=100)
println("phase 1: got $minf at $minx (returned $ret)")
(minf,minx,ret) = optimize(eo, minx, ftol=-1, xtol=0.001, maxtime=30, pop=100)
println("phase 2: got $minf at $minx (returned $ret)")

render("/home/rzwitch/Desktop/kd-rects.svg", eo, minx)

```

Here, it’s a slight bit easier to see that SAS and Python are about the same area-wise and that R is larger, although the different dimensions do obscure this fact a bit.

## Summary

If I spent more time with this package, I’m sure I could make something even more aesthetically pleasing. And for that matter, it’s still a pre-production package that will no doubt get better in the future. But at the very least, there is a way to create an area-proportional representation of relationships using VennEuler.jl in Julia.
