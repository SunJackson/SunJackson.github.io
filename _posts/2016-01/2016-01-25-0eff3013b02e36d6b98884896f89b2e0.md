I was asked five questions by Alex Woodie of Datanami for his article, “**[So You Want To Be A Data Scientist](http://www.datanami.com/2015/06/04/so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist-a-guide-for-college-grads)**”. He used a few snippets from my full set of answers. The longer version of my answers provided additional advice. For aspiring data scientists of all ages, I provide in **[my article at MapR](https://www.mapr.com/blog/definitive-qa-aspiring-data-scientists)** the full, unabridged version of my answers, which may help you even more to achieve your goal.  Here are Alex’s questions. (Note: I paraphrase the original questions in quotes below.)

## 1. “What is the number one piece of advice you give to aspiring data scientists?”

## 2. “What are the most important skills for an aspiring data scientist to acquire?”

## 3. “Is it better for a person to stay in school and enroll in a graduate program, or is it better to acquire the skills on-the-job?”

## 4. “For someone who stays in school, do you recommend that they enroll in a program tailored toward data science, or would they get the requisite skills in a ‘hard science’ program such as astrophysics (like you)?”

## 5. “Do you see advances in analytic packages replacing the need for some of the skills that data scientists have traditionally had, such as programming skills (Python, Java, etc.)?”
