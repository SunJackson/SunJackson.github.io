**The 0.2.0 release of the `spark-ts` package includes includes a fleshed-out Java API, among other things.**

The `spark-ts` library, which was initially developed by Cloudera’s Data Science team, enables analysis of datasets comprising millions of time series, each with millions of measurements. It runs atop Apache Spark, and exposes Scala, Java, and Python APIs. Check out this recent [post](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/12/spark-ts-a-new-library-for-analyzing-time-series-data-with-apache-spark) for a closer look at the library and how to use it.

Time Series for Spark 0.2.0 released earlier in January 2016. With more than 100 commits from seven contributors, the release includes a number of features and changes. We’ll cover the major ones here.

Full documentation is available [here](http://sryza.github.io/spark-timeseries/0.2.0/index.html#overview). The [examples repo](https://github.com/sryza/spark-ts-examples) contains updated examples that work with the release. (As a reminder, Cloudera does not currently offer support for`spark-ts`.)

## Nanosecond Precision and java.time

`spark-ts` 0.1 used the [JodaTime](http://www.joda.org/joda-time) library for representing and operating on DateTimes, but JodaTime only supports timestamps at millisecond precision, which is too constraining for domains like finance. The  0.2 release instead relies on Java 8’s `java.time` library, which supports nanosecond precision. As the`spark-ts` library often uses longs to represent timestamps internally, this means that it can only represent times within 292 years of the Unix epoch, i.e. between the years 1678 and 2262 AD. Another consequence of this change is that the library now no longer works with Java 7 and below.

## Java API

The library now has a fleshed-out Java API. In many cases, Java users can use the Scala APIs. For example, there is only one version of the [`DateTimeIndex`](http://cloudera.github.io/spark-timeseries/0.2.0/scaladocs/index.html#com.cloudera.sparkts.DateTimeIndex) class, accessible to both Java and Scala. However, for better compatibility with Spark’s `JavaRDD` API, as well as to smooth out some of the quirks of Java/Scala interaction,`spark-ts` now provides a [`JavaTimeSeriesRDD`](http://cloudera.github.io/spark-timeseries/0.2.0/scaladocs/index.html#com.cloudera.sparkts.api.java.JavaTimeSeriesRDD) and [factories](http://cloudera.github.io/spark-timeseries/0.2.0/apidocs/index.html) for creating `TimeSeriesRDD`s and `DateTimeIndex`es. A consequence is that the library has transitioned from Breeze to Spark’s [`Vector` and `Matrix`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.package) classes, because they pay better attention to Java support, although Breeze is still used under the covers in many cases.

## Non-String Time Series Identifiers

The library represents multivariate time series as collections of <key, series> tuples, where the series is a univariate series and the key is an identifier. In 0.1, these keys were restricted to be String objects, but in 0.2, they can be any arbitrary Java or Scala object.  In the Python API, these identifiers are still restricted to be strings.

## Lags

`TimeSeries` and `TimeSeriesRDD`s now support lag operators that augment the original dataset with shifted versions of each univariate series.
