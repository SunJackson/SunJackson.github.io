### I finally got rid of WordPress!

After experiencing the Hacker News Effect twice last month, WordPress kept on randomly crashing on my server. I tried many tricks, including caching, extra memory, plug-in cleanup, scheduled rebooting, mysql optimisation, and none of them fixed the issue. The more I digged into WordPress’s config system, the more I am convinced that the design became too bloated for my taste.

*Hacker News Effects*

After doing some digging around, I decided to switch over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static blog generator, and using this [Type Theme](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type) that I found from on [this](http://rinuboney.github.io/) blog.

I also went through the painstaking process of converting all my previous WordPress post over to Jekyll!
