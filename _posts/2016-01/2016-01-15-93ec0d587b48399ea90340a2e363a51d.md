Simple image recognition app using TensorFlow and Shiny

![](http://opiateforthemass.es/images/image_recognition_demo.gif)


My weekend was full of deep learning and AI programming so as a milestone I made a simple image recognition app that:

- Takes an image input uploaded to Shiny UI

- Performs image recognition using TensorFlow

- Plots detected objects and scores in wordcloud


This app is to demonstrate powerful image recognition functionality using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) following the first half of [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html).In the backend a pretrained **classify_image.py** is running, with the model being pretrained by *tensorflow.org*.This Python file takes a jpg/jpeg file as an input and performs image classifications.

I will then use R to handle the classification results and produce wordcloud based on detected objects and their scores.

The app is based on R (shiny and wordcloud packages), Python 2.7 (tensorflow, six and numpy packages) and TensorFlow (Tensorflow itself and [this python file](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py)).Please make sure that you have all the above packages installed. For help installing TensorFlow [this link](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup) should be helpful.

Just like a usual Shiny app, you only need two components; `server.R` and `ui.R` in it.This is optional but you can change number of objects in the image recognition output by changing [the line 63 of classify_image.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py#L63)

```
tf.app.flags.DEFINE_integer('num_top_predictions', 5#I changed this to 10,
 """Display this many predictions.""")
```

## server.R

I put comments on almost every line in server.R so you can follow the logic more easily.

```
library(wordcloud)
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
 PYTHONPATH <- "path/to/your/python" #should look like /Users/yourname/anaconda/bin if you use anaconda python distribution in OS X
 CLASSIFYIMAGEPATH <- "path/to/your/classify_image.py" #should look like ~/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet
 
 outputtext <- reactive({
 ###This is to compose image recognition template###
 inFile <- input$file1 #This creates input button that enables image upload
 template <- paste0(PYTHONPATH,"/python ",CLASSIFYIMAGEPATH,"/classify_image.py") #Template to run image recognition using Python
 if (is.null(inFile))
 {res <- system(paste0(template," --image_file /tmp/imagenet/cropped_panda.jpg"),intern=T)} else { #Initially the app classifies cropped_panda.jpg, if you download the model data to a different directory, you should change /tmp/imagenet to the location you use. 
 res <- system(paste0(template," --image_file ",inFile$datapath),intern=T) #Uploaded image will be used for classification
 }
 })
 
 output$plot <- renderPlot({
 ###This is to create wordcloud based on image recognition results###
 df <- data.frame(gsub(" *\\(.*?\\) *", "", outputtext()),gsub("[^0-9.]", "", outputtext())) #Make a dataframe using detected objects and scores
 names(df) <- c("Object","Score") #Set column names
 df$Object <- as.character(df$Object) #Convert df$Object to character
 df$Score <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Score)) #Convert df$Score to numeric
 s <- strsplit(as.character(df$Object), ',') #Split rows by comma to separate rows
 df <- data.frame(Object=unlist(s), Score=rep(df$Score, sapply(s, FUN=length))) #Allocate scores to split words
 # By separating long categories into shorter terms, we can avoid "could not be fit on page. It will not be plotted" warning as much as possible
 wordcloud(df$Object, df$Score, scale=c(4,2),
 colors=brewer.pal(6, "RdBu"),random.order=F) #Make wordcloud
 })
 
 output$outputImage <- renderImage({
 ###This is to plot uploaded image###
 if (is.null(input$file1)){
 outfile <- "/tmp/imagenet/cropped_panda.jpg"
 contentType <- "image/jpg"
 #Panda image is the default
 }else{
 outfile <- input$file1$datapath
 contentType <- input$file1$type
 #Uploaded file otherwise
 }
 
 list(src = outfile,
 contentType=contentType,
 width=300)
 }, deleteFile = TRUE)
})
```

## ui.R

The `ui.R` file is rather simple:

```
shinyUI(
 fluidPage(titlePanel("Simple Image Recognition App using TensorFlow and Shiny"),
 tags$hr(),
 fluidRow(
 column(width=4,
 fileInput('file1', '',accept = c('.jpg','.jpeg')),
 imageOutput('outputImage')
 ),
 column(width=8,
 plotOutput("plot")
 )
 )
 )
 )
```

## Shiny App

Thatâ€™s it!Here is a checklist to run the app without an error.

- Make sure you have all the requirements installed

- You have `server.R` and `ui.R` in the same folder

- You corrently set `PYTHONPATH` and `CLASSIFYIMAGEPATH`

- Optionally, `change num_top_predictions` in `classify_image.py`

- Upload images should be in jpg/jpeg format


I was personally impressed with what machine finds in abstract paintings or modern art ðŸ˜‰
