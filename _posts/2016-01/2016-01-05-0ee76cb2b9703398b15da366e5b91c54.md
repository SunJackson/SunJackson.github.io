Finally finished a piece of artwork called Random Radicals – A Fake Kanji Experiment. It has been my goal for many months now to build something that can write fake Chinese characters into a web browser.

I designed the layout algorithm to write the fake Kanji in a way that resembles the work of the King of Kowloon.

The final result looked very different than what I initially planned, which was to show individual characters and to have users interact with the pen. That would have been cool. I hope this work will get people to think about machine learning techniques that enable computers to create content, leading one step closer to creative and curious machines.
