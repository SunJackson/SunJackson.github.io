I was selected as recipient of the 2016 Junior Scientific Award by the Complex System Society!

The award reads: *Emilio Ferrara is one of the most active and successful young researchers in the field of computational social sciences. His works include the design and application of novel network-science models, algorithms, and tools to study phenomena occurring in large, dynamical techno-social systems. They improved our understanding of the structure of large online social networks and the dynamics of information diffusion. He has explored online social phenomena (protests, rumours, etc.), with applications to model and forecast individual behaviour, and characterise information diffusion and cyber-crime. *
