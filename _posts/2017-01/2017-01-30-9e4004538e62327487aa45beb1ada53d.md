David Meza is Chief Knowledge Architect at NASA, and talks to Renee in this episode about his educational background, his early work at NASA, and examples of his work with multidisciplinary teams. He also describes a project involving a graph database that improved search capabilities so NASA engineers could more easily find “lessons learned”.
