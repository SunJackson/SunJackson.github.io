~~Despite [my preference for SAS over R](http://randyzwitch.com/learning-r-sas),~~ there are some add-ons to “basic” R that I’ve found that have made my learning process way easier. While I’m still in my infancy in learning R, I feel like once I found these additional tools, my ability to use R to get work done improved significantly.

In this first post of three, I’ll discuss [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/), a more friendly access point to the default installation of R.  My second post will discuss [Rcmdr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html), a GUI developed for students taking a basic college-level course in Statistics.  The third post will cover [rattle](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rattle/index.html), a GUI specifically designed for data mining (as opposed to more general statistics like [Rcmdr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html)).

## RStudio

R Studio is an IDE that dramatically improves the R experience


[RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download) is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a more consistent user experience to R.  There are many great features of [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download) over “basic” R, including:

- Consistent windowing between sessions (customizable by the user)

- Point-and-click exploration of data frames and other data objects

- Importing data files through dialog box functionality

- Customizable code syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and Help menu access from the code editor

- Ability to see all installed packages, turn on packages using a checkbox, and download libraries (and their dependencies) without having to write any code

- Version Control using GitHub


While [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download) doesn’t provide a GUI that will help you run a regression model or build a graph, it provides a more “friendly” environment to work in as compared to the command-line interface of a default installation of R.  I find that by having elements like the currently active data objects and available/active packages with links to the Help files “exposed” at all times, [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download) reminds me of where my analysis has been and gives me a quick way to think about “What Else?” to pursue if I hit a roadblock.

## Installation of RStudio

[RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download) installs like any other program for Windows or Mac OSX.  As far as I can tell, there are no advantages to using [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download) in either environment, both the Windows and OSX versions seem to work equally well.  The most important consideration is that RStudio is just an “add-on” so-to-speak, it does not include R itself.  So be sure to go to one of the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) sites](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download R first.
