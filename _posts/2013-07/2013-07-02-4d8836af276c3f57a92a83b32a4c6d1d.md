How much do you *really* spend on coffee?

As we will see, compounding interest (and loss of opportunity) build up over time …

Everyday? Every weekday?

All those *super-dooper-latté-mocha-frapa-iced-soy-crema-chinos (with whip)* add up …

More Examples
I’m not picking on coffee in particular. The purpose of this exercise was to show about compounding interest and opportunity costs. It’s just as valid to use this argument about other things you consume on a regular basis. Do you drink a can of soda a few times a week? How about a daily doughnut, candybar or other kind of treat? What about haircuts, manicures, waxing, movies or beer?

Or that mortgage payment …
