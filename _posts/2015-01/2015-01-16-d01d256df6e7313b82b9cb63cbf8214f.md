There are now quite a few blog posts on the NIPS experiment, I just wanted to put a place together where I could link to them all. It’s a great set of posts from community mainstays, newcomers and those outside our research fields.

Just as a reminder, Corinna and I were extremely open about the entire review process, with a series of posts about how we engaging the reviewers and processing the data. All that background can be found through a [separate post here](http://inverseprobability.com/2014/12/16/the-nips-experiment).

At the time of writing there is also still [quite a lot of twitter traffic](https://twitter.com/search?q=nips%20experiment) on the experiment.
