**Problem**

Motorola Mobility wanted to use insights from customer data to better address smartphone product issues and customer needs. “We wanted to minimize service and repair failures and believed we could become more proactive in addressing our customers’ needs following a smartphone launch,” said Ahmad Shabazz, senior manager of business operations and strategy at Motorola Mobility, according to a [Datascope case study](http://datascopeanalytics.com/static/uploads/blog/2014-11-04/datascope-motorola.pdf).  

Bo Peng, data scientist at Datascope Analytics explains Motorola Mobility also wanted to provide quick feedback to its service engineers. “The data were product-related assessments and opinions of Motorola products. It comprised real-time unstructured text from hundreds of millions of phrases and Internet references from around the world,” Peng says.
