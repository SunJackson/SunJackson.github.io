 Event Details
 


Visit us at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com) in New York City on Tuesday, November 4 from 7-8pm and meet the instructors and students of our [Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science).

Enjoy pizza and drinks on us as Data Science instructors Irmak Sirer and Laurie Skelly walk you through a sampling of what students learn throughout their 12 weeks of project-based Data Science work. 

Leah Nicolai, Metis Program Manager, and Lillian Landrum, Metis Talent Placement Manager, will be available to chat with you about the bootcamp student experience. Metis co-founder Jason Moss will also be at Open House night to take your questions.

Plan on learning about the Bootcamp curriculum and outcomes and how it culminates with the Metis Career Day when hiring partners come to Metis for student portfolio reviews.

**Laurie Skelly***Metis Data Science Instructor[@laurieskelly](https://twitter.com/laurieskelly)*

Laurie, a data scientist at [Datascope](http://datascopeanalytics.com/), loves going after tough answers to great questions. At Datascope, Laurie builds analytical tools for a wide range of clients to help them use data to solve their business problems. Prior to her switch to data science, she studied social neuroscience at the University of Chicago, building machine learning models of imaging data to explain how the brains of incarcerated psychopaths perceive and process emotions. Her least favorite part of data science is pruning the scope of a project down to a manageable size. Actually, that is her least favorite part of most things. Laurie is a passionate teacher, and she is very excited to return to the front of the classroom for the Data Science bootcamp.
