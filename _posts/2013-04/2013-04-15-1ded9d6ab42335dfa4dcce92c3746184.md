You've probably seen Sudoku: it's a puzzle consisting of a 9x9 grid
of numbers, with some spaces left blank.
The grid must be filled so that each row, column,
and 3x3 box contains the numbers 1-9. It's a generalization of the
*Latin Squares* first studied by Leonhard Euler nearly 300 years ago.

The reason I chose to use Sudoku here is simple: not only is today
Euler's birthday, but Sudoku is how I first learned Python.
My first year of graduate school, my research advisor
recommended that I learn Python for the project I was working on.
Sudoku had just become popular in the US at the time, and I decided to
learn Python by writing a Sudoku solver. I did it over my winter
break, and the rest (so it's said) is history.

Note that this is by no means a new subject: you can read about Sudoku
in Python in several places, and there are even a few code golf solutions
floating around out there. In particular, you should take a look at
[this solution](http://www.scottkirkwood.com/2006/07/shortest-sudoku-solver-in-python.html),
which is the shortest solver I've seen, and from which I borrowed a few
of the tricks used below.

Here we'll pose the problem in a slightly different way, which will give
us the chance to develop a brand new short algorithm.
