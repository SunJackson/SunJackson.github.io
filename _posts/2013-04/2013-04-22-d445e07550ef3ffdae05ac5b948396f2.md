One of the earliest, classic, video games is the game of Snake.

It dates back to the 1970's. In the standard variant of the game, the player controls a long *snake-like* create which is confined in a box.

If the head touches either the walls, or any other part of the snake's body the game is over.A single, randomly placed, piece of food is also on the screen. The snake starts off short, and the aim is to drive the snake over the food item.After the snake eats the food, he grows in length and a new piece of food is randomly placed on the board.The game starts off relatively easy and forgiving, but as the game progresses, it gets harder to get to the food and not eat part of your own tail.|

Each segement of the body of the snake follows the one infront. If the head touches either the walls, or any other part of the snake's body the game is over.

After the snake eats the food, he grows in length and a new piece of food is randomly placed on the board.

I've seen some version of snake running on just about every computer I've ever encountered. The above screen is a picture taken on an early Nokia Phone. It's a fun programming exercise to write a simple version of the game. It can be used as a great example to teach young students the concept of code optimisation – when rendering the snake, it's not necessary to redraw all the snakes each time; you simple have to draw the new position of the head and take the last segment of the tail away!

So why all this reminiscing about snake?

The other day, a few of my [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/home.php) friends forwarded me this little animiated GIF, showing an exceptional player beating the game.

At various times, it looks like he's going to get trapped, but just at the last second the tail passes by and creates space for the head to move into!
