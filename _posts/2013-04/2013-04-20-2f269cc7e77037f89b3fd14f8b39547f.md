… E–I–E–I–O !”
* The point of an orbit which is closest to the Sun.

There's a children's nursery rhyme and song called Old MacDonald which describes a collection of animals kept on a farm.

The chorus of the song contains the phrase *E–I–E–I–O*

Ever wondered what English words contain these vowels, and only these vowels, in that order?

### More words

If we relax the criteria a little to allow words that contain other vowels as well as the *E–I–E–I–O* requirements, we can generate a longer list. The following words all have the five vowels in the song order, but might also contain other vowels (including some in the middle of the *E–I–E–I–O* string).

PERIHELION
