A couple of days ago
at [blunch](https://twitter.com/laurieskelly/status/443808514608070656), [Irmak](https://twitter.com/frrmack) told
me about [Threes!](http://asherv.com/threes), a phone
game written by Asher
Vollmer and Greg
Wohlwend.

If you haven’t played it, the basic idea of the game is that
there’s a grid of numbered cards and you push the cards around
(left, right, up, or down) to try to pair matching numbers. If you
push a pair of adjacent threes together, you get a six. If you push
sixes together, you get a twelve, and so forth. The higher the number
on your cards, the higher your score.


Yesterday morning I was enjoying a Threes binge on my train ride
downtown. A few times when I made a bad move, I frustratedly pushed
cards around at random, to hurry up and get the game over so I could
start a new one. Near the end of the ride, using this
it's-not-quitting-if-you-don't-hit-'new-game' strategy, I
random-swiped my way to a surprisingly high score (around a 900 — I
think my intentional high score was about 1,200 at that point). This,
I must admit, was a blow to my ego. I’m
clearly not as
good as I thought I was if I can just swipe around randomly
and get a high score.



Wondering just how well anybody would do if they picked all their
moves at random, I wrote
a quick
program to play a thousand games of Threes (the
nice web
version by Angela
Li) using the random-swipe approach. Below, see what score you
would expect to get if your strategy
were... “less-than-brilliant.” But first, here’s a
mesmerizing screen capture of the program in action:



Here's a histogram of the scores of the random-swiper over a thousand games:

Over 1,000 games, the average score came out to 272. That's a bit of a
relief: my average is higher than that. However, once in about every
100 games, rando-swiper scores above a 950, so if you really want to
be sure you are better, you'll want to beat that. Aside. The
peaks in the distribution are due to the fact that scores from
individual cards come in powers of three: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729,
...

Here's another way of looking at it (code is [here](https://gist.github.com/stringertheory/9549661)):

Here's another way of looking at it (code is [here](https://gist.github.com/stringertheory/9549661)):

Look up the number of games you've played and your high score. If
you're in the green region, you can be confident you're better than
random. If you're in the yellow region, you're not doing any better
than random. If you're in the orange region, look on the bright side:
you have an simple strategy for improving your scores!

### Update on April 8th, 2014

I was talking with David Smith from Revolution Analytics
([@revodavid](http://twitter.com/revodavid)) yesterday, and the
topic of Threes game came up because he also wrote [a blog post about it.](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/04/because-its-friday-numbers-game.html) He mentioned that a friend
recommended a "Tetris-like" strategy: move primarily only in one
direction (for example, only use left, right and down). I quickly ran
a few hundred simulations with the revised strategy, but it turns out
that the distribution of scores is statistically indistinguishable
(p=0.89 using bootstrap KS test, [R script here](https://gist.github.com/stringertheory/10060638#file-ks-r)) from random-swiping in all four directions. Let us know of any other interesting strategies to test!
