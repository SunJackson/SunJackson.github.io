**Reflecting on my first Python program**

Reflection is always a helpful (and sometimes entertaining ) exercise. For nostalgiaâ€™s sakeâ€Šâ€”â€Šif one can be nostalgic for something 2 years oldâ€” I wanted to share my first Python program. I initially picked up Python as an aerospace engineering student to avoid spreadsheets and little did I know how good a decision this would turn out to be.

My Python education began with the book [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart, an excellent application-based book with simple programs to do useful tasks. When I learn a new topic, I look for any chances to use it and I needed a problem to solve in Python. Fortunately, I found one in the form of a $200 textbook required for a class. My personal limit for textbooks is about $20 (*Automate the Boring Stuff* is free online) and I refused to even rent this book. Desperate to get the book before the first assignment, I saw it was available for a free one-week trial through Amazon with a new account. I got the book for one week and was able to do the first assignment. While I could have kept creating new accounts one week at a time, I needed a better solution. Enter Python and my first programming application.

One of many useful libraries in *Automate the Boring Stuff* is [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest) which allows you to control the keyboard and mouse through Python. They say when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail, and that was definitely the case here. Python and pyautogui would allow me to press the arrow keys and take screenshots, and I put the two together to come up with a solution to the book issue. I wrote my first program to automatically turn through every page in the book and take a screenshot. The end program was only 10 lines long yet I was nearly as proud of it as anything I had done in aerospace engineering! Following is the program in its entirety:

```
import pyautogui
import time

# Sleep for 5 seconds to allow me to open book
time.sleep(5)

# Range can be changed depending on the number of pages
for i in range(1000):

# Turn page
 pyautogui.keyDown('right')
 pyautogui.keyUp('right')

# Take and save a screenshot
 pyautogui.screenshot('images/page_%d.pdf' % i)
 time.sleep(0.05)

```

Running the program is pretty simple (I encourage anyone to try). I saved the script as book_screenshot.py, then pulled up a command prompt in the same folder and typed:

```
python book_screenshot.py

```

Then I would have 5 seconds to flip to the book and put it into fullscreen. The program would do the rest, flipping through every page and taking a screenshot that was saved as a pdf. I could then join all the pdfs together into one file, and have a (questionably legal) copy of the book! Granted, this was a pretty awful copy because it could not be searched, but I made any excuse possible to use my â€œbookâ€�.

*I could watch this for hours*

This example demonstrates two key points that have stuck with me as I continue my data science education:

1. The [best way to learn a new skill is to find a problem you need to solve](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-master-new-skills-656d42d0e09c?source=user_profile---------7----------------)!

1. You donâ€™t need to fully master a skill before it is useful.


With just a few lines of code and a free online book, I wrote a program that I actually put to use. Learning the basics can be tedious, and my first attempts to learn Python failed within a few hours as I got stuck with ideas like data structures and loops. Changing tactics, I started to develop solutions to real problems and ended up learning the fundamentals along the way. There is so much to master in programming and data science, but you donâ€™t need to learn everything at once. Pick a problem you need to solve and get started!

Since then, I have made a few [more sophisticated programs](https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-analysis-in-python-a0054e2c1a4c), but I still remember this first script with fondness!

Share your first program! I welcome discussion, feedback, and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will.
