Insurance customers demand real-time, personalized and omnichannel claims. At the same time, in this critical “moment of truth”, customers are increasingly craving a human connection, and to be listened to as a unique individual, not just a number in a database.

Can AI be the solution for hyper-personalized claims experience at scale?

Insurance Nexus is bringing Andrew Pelcin (VP - Claims Data Analytics Implementation, Chubb) and Natalie Kaschalk (Head of Auto Claims Strategy, Farmers Insurance) to discuss how AI is transforming claims from a necessary back-office function into a source of competitive advantage.

Here is what you can learn by tuning in to our webinar:

- **Unlock the value of claims data** - Determine which existing data sets can be used to enhance the claims process

- **Achieve straight-through claims processing** – Create fully automated business workflows that speed up transactions, making the claims handler’s workload more productive and exceed customer expectations

- **Win the war on fraud** – Deploy AI and teach algorithms to pick up inconsistencies and identify suspicious patterns in claims, freeing up investigators for more complicated cases that only humans can handle

- **Debunk the myth: customers don’t want to claim digitally** - Listen to how carriers are incentivizing their customers to use digital services and improving their NPS score
