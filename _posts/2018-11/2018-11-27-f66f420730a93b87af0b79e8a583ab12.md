To help resolve the debate about which are the most popular Python IDEs or editors, we ask

**What Python Editors or IDEs you used the most in 2018?**



Please vote below (choose at most 3) and also indicate your employment type.


We will analyze and publish the results in about 2 weeks.


Yes, we know that many of you prefer R and RStudio and we will run a separate poll about R later (you can post your R IDEs nominations in the comments).
