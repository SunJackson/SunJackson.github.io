**Robust Sparse Principal Component Analysis (ROSPCA)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
A new sparse PCA algorithm is presented, which is robust against outliers. The approach is based on the ROBPCA algorithm that generates robust but nonsparse loadings. The construction of the new ROSPCA method is detailed, as well as a selection criterion for the sparsity parameter. An extensive simulation study and a real data example are performed, showing that it is capable of accurately finding the sparse structure of datasets, even when challenging outliers are present. In comparison with a projection pursuit-based algorithm, ROSPCA demonstrates superior robustness properties and comparable sparsity estimation capability, as well as significantly faster computation time. … 

**DELIMIT** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
DELIMIT is a framework extension for deep learning in diffusion imaging, which extends the basic framework PyTorch towards spherical signals. Based on several novel layers, deep learning can be applied to spherical diffusion imaging data in a very convenient way. First, two spherical harmonic interpolation layers are added to the extension, which allow to transform the signal from spherical surface space into the spherical harmonic space, and vice versa. In addition, a local spherical convolution layer is introduced that adds the possibility to include gradient neighborhood information within the network. Furthermore, these extensions can also be utilized for the preprocessing of diffusion signals. …

Kayak: Library for Deep Neural Networks. This is a library that implements some useful modules and provides automatic differentiation utilities for learning deep neural networks. It is similar in spirit to tools like Theano and Torch. The objective of Kayak is to be simple to use and extend, for rapid prototyping in Python. It is unlikely to be faster than these other tools, although it is competitive and sometimes faster in performance when the architectures are highly complex. It will certainly not be faster on convolutional architectures for visual object detection and recognition tasks than, e.g., Alex Krizhevsky’s CUDA Convnet or Caffe. The point of Kayak is to be able to experiment in Python with patterns that look a lot like what you’re already used to with Numpy. It makes it easy to manage batches of data and compute gradients with backpropagation. …
