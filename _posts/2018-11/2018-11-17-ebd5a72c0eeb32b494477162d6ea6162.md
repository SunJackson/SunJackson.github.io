A second and minor update for the RcppGetconf package for reading system configuration — not unlike `getconf` from the libc library — is now on CRAN.

Changes are minor. We avoid an error on a long-dead operating system cherished in one particular corner of the CRAN world. In doing so some files were updated so that dynamically loaded routines are now registered too.

The short list of changes in this release follows:

> 
Changes in inline version 0.0.3 (2018-11-16)

- Examples no longer run on Solaris where they appear to fail.



Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report. More about the package is at the local RcppGetconf page and the GitHub repo.
