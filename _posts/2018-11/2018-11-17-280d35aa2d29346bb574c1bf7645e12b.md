**Halide** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Halide is a computer programming language designed for writing digital image processing code that takes advantage of memory locality, vectorized computation and multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Halide is implemented as an internal domain-specific language (DSL) in C++. The main innovation Halide brings is the separation of the algorithm being implemented from its execution schedule, i.e. code specifying the loop nesting, parallelization, loop unrolling and vector instruction. These two are usually interleaved together and experimenting with changing the schedule requires the programmer to rewrite large portions of the algorithm with every change. With Halide, changing the schedule does not require any changes to the algorithm and this allows the programmer to experiment with scheduling and finding the most efficient one.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**Learning Active Learning (LAL)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we suggest a novel data-driven approach to active learning: Learning Active Learning (LAL). The key idea behind LAL is to train a regressor that predicts the expected error reduction for a potential sample in a particular learning state. By treating the query selection procedure as a regression problem we are not restricted to dealing with existing AL heuristics; instead, we learn strategies based on experience from previous active learning experiments. We show that LAL can be learnt from a simple artificial 2D dataset and yields strategies that work well on real data from a wide range of domains. Moreover, if some domain-specific samples are available to bootstrap active learning, the LAL strategy can be tailored for a particular problem. … 

**Dimensional Clustering** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)

This paper introduces a new clustering technique, called {\em dimensional clustering}, which clusters each data point by its latent {\em pointwise dimension}, which is a measure of the dimensionality of the data set local to that point. Pointwise dimension is invariant under a broad class of transformations. As a result, dimensional clustering can be usefully applied to a wide range of datasets. Concretely, we present a statistical model which estimates the pointwise dimension of a dataset around the points in that dataset using the distance of each point from its $n^{\text{th}}$ nearest neighbor. We demonstrate the applicability of our technique to the analysis of dynamical systems, images, and complex human movements. …
