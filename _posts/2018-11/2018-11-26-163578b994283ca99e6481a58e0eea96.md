The first time we at STATWORX are organizing a workshop for anyone who wants to learn more about data and graphics.

Our “Data Visualization in R and ggplot2” workshop is designed for R-beginners and provides the perfect mixture between theory and practice. The workshop will be held at Mindspace in Munich.Participants achieve first insights into the concepts of data visualization in R and the famous `ggplot2` package. Famous newspapers are using ggplot2 to create good looking graphics.
