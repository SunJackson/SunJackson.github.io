The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used classifier. And yet, obtaining the best results with SVMs requires an understanding of their workings and the various ways a user can in uence their accuracy. We provide the user with a basic understanding of the theory behind SVMs and focus on their use in practice. We describe the effect of the SVM parameters on the resulting classifier, how to select good values for those parameters, data normalization, factors that affect training time, and software for training SVMs. A User’s Guide to Support Vector Machines
