This is a writeup of lectures on ‘statistics’ that have evolved from the 2009 Hadron Collider Physics Summer School at CERN to the forthcoming 2018 school at Fermilab. The emphasis is on foundations, using simple examples to illustrate the points that are still debated in the professional statistics literature. The three main approaches to interval estimation (Neyman confidence, Bayesian, likelihood ratio) are discussed and compared in detail, with and without nuisance parameters. Hypothesis testing is discussed mainly from the frequentist point of view, with pointers to the Bayesian literature. Various foundational issues are emphasized, including the conditionality principle and the likelihood principle. Lectures on Statistics in Theory: Prelude to Statistics in Practice
