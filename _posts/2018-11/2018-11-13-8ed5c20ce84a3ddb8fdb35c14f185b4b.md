I am very humbled and honored by being selected as no. 1 on 
**LinkedIn Top Voices 2018: Data Science & Analytics**.


Since what I publish on LinkedIn are selected posts from KDnuggets, this is a recognition of the great content we publish here.


Of course, this success is also due in large part to KDnuggets editor 

Matthew Mayo and KDnuggets Assistant Editor 

Dan Clark who do a great job with editing and publishing KDnuggets.


From LinkedIn post announcing #LinkedInTopVoices:

These are the 10 must-know writers and creators discussing everything from the prominence of Python to the ethical implications of artificial intelligence.
Every day, over 2 million posts, videos and articles course through the LinkedIn feed, generating tens of thousands of comments every hour - and tens of millions more shares and likes. So, who stood out in 2018 - and who should you be following to stay ahead?


We dug into the data to reveal our 4th annual LinkedIn Top Voices list, uncovering today's must-follow professionals in data science and analytics. To find standout voices, we use a combination of data and editorial signals. We screen for engagement among professionals sharing in their area of expertise, looking at what kind of conversations - measured by engagement, including comments and re-shares - their original content is creating. We track relative follower growth, too: Are these professionals attracting dedicated fans in their particular sector? Finally, we emphasize quality and diversity; the list should reflect the world we work in.


These members have shared about everything from how to tell a persuasive story with data and A.I. transforming the way we work to how to interview and the human side of data science. They are curating what you need to know to stay ahead when it comes to data, both big and small: how we use it, how we protect it and its future potential.


Here are this year's 10 #LinkedInTopVoices in data science and analytics.
