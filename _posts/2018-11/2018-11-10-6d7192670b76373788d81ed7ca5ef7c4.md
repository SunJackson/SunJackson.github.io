A new RcppArmadillo release, now at 0.9.200.4.0, based on the new Armadillo release 9.200.4 from earlier this week, is now on CRAN, and should get to Debian very soon.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 532 (or 31 more since just the last release!) other packages on CRAN.

This release once again brings a number of improvements, see below for details.

Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.9.200.4.0 (2018-11-09)


Upgraded to Armadillo release 9.200.4 (Carpe Noctem)


faster handling of symmetric positive definite matrices by `rcond()`


faster transpose of matrices with size ≥ 512×512


faster handling of compound sparse matrix expressions by `accu()`, `diagmat()`, `trace()`


faster handling of sparse matrices by `join_rows()`


expanded `sign()` to handle scalar arguments


expanded operators (`*`, `%`, `+`, `−`) to handle sparse matrices with differing element types (eg. multiplication of complex matrix by real matrix)


expanded `conv_to()` to allow conversion between sparse matrices with differing element types


expanded `solve()` to optionally allow keeping solutions of systems singular to working precision


workaround for `gcc` and `clang` bug in C++17 mode




Commented-out sparse matrix test consistently failing on the fedora-clang machine CRAN, and only there. No fix without access.


The ‘Unit test’ vignette is no longer included.




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
