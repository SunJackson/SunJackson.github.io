“Business culture needs to go through a fundamental change to become data-driven. It’s not the new tools, more data, or a PhD-holder staff that will make the change happen. A system, a program, or a robot, designed to be most rational, capable, and failure-proof is put to action only if the environment it operates in allows it. Analytics have been available for years, but they continue being misused because the business models they aid are inherently incompatible. Centrally manged organisations by design impede change; its time that decision making becomes more democratic and distributed, as is data.” Eve the Analyst ( 7th November 2017 )
