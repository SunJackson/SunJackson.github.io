**automated CLAUse DETectEr (Claudette)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Machine Learning Powered Analysis of Consumer Contracts and Privacy Policies. CLAUDETTE – ‘automated CLAUse DETectEr’ – is an interdisciplinary research project hosted at the Law Department of the European University Institute, led by professors Giovanni Sartor and Hans-W. Micklitz, in cooperation with engineers from University of Bologna and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The research objective is to test to what extent is it possible to automate reading and legal assessment of online consumer contracts and privacy policies, to evaluate their compliance with EU´s unfair contractual terms law and personal data protection law (GDPR), using machine learning and grammar-based approaches. The idea arose out of bewilderment. Having read dozens of terms of service and of privacy policies of online platforms, we came to conclusion that despite substantive law in place, and despite enforcers´ competence for abstract control, providers of online services still tend to use unfair and unlawful clauses in these documents. Hence, the idea to automate parts of enforcement process by delegating certain tasks to machines. On one hand, we believe that relying on automation can increase quality and effectiveness of legal work of enforcers. On the other, we want to empower consumers themselves, by giving them tools to quickly assess whether what they agree to online is fair and/or lawful. … 

**Dfuntest** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
New ideas in distributed systems (algorithms or protocols) are commonly tested by simulation, because experimenting with a prototype deployed on a realistic platform is cumbersome. However, a prototype not only measures performance but also verifies assumptions about the underlying system. We developed dfuntest – a testing framework for distributed applications that defines abstractions and test structure, and automates experiments on distributed platforms. Dfuntest aims to be jUnit’s analogue for distributed applications; a framework that enables the programmer to write robust and flexible scenarios of experiments. Dfuntest requires minimal bindings that specify how to deploy and interact with the application. Dfuntest’s abstractions allow execution of a scenario on a single machine, a cluster, a cloud, or any other distributed infrastructure, e.g. on PlanetLab. A scenario is a procedure; thus, our framework can be used both for functional tests and for performance measurements. We show how to use dfuntest to deploy our DHT prototype on 60 PlanetLab nodes and verify whether the prototype maintains a correct topology. … 

**MapReduce for C (MR4C)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
MR4C is an implementation framework that allows you to run native code within the Hadoop execution framework. Pairing the performance and flexibility of natively developed algorithms with the unfettered scalability and throughput inherent in Hadoop, MR4C enables large-scale deployment of advanced data processing applications. …
