Applications from business intelligence to machine learning and artificial intelligence rely on clean data to be effective. Many companies, however, do not have Enterprise Data Management strategies that fully leverage their data and make it available across the entire organization.

“Research shows that 40% of the anticipated value of all business initiatives is never achieved. Poor data quality in both the planning and execution phases of these initiatives is a primary cause,” according to Gartner.

In this webinar we will explore how to implement an Enterprise Data Management strategy that will unleash your data to power decisions, fuel efficiencies and shape the direction of your organization. We will examine a real-world digital-transformation use case from a Tier-1 bank and see a demo of Trifacta Wrangler.

In this 50-minute webinar you’ll learn:

- Why data lakes become data swamps

- Effective Enterprise Data Management Strategies

- Corporate Data Pyramid

- The role of data preparation and how it fits into the corporate data pyramid

- Key elements of data preparation to clean the swamp into pristine data assets


Webinar will be followed by 10 minute Q&A.
