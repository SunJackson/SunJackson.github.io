For a science fiction show set hundreds of years in the future, The Expanse is unusual in that it takes very few liberties with Science as we understand it today. The solar system is made up of the familiar planets we know (other than the colonists and space stations spread throughout the system), communication is limited by the speed of light, and and spaceships operate under standard Newtonian principles. You can get a good sense in this highlight reel of the visual effects of the show:


The series was recently saved from cancellation by Amazon: the first three series are streaming on Amazon Prime now (in the US at least) and I can't wait for the fourth season and the continuation of the excellent story, which hews closely to the source novels.

That's all from from the blog for this week. Next week will be a short week for us with US Thanksgiving coming up: if you're celebrating, have a great holiday!
