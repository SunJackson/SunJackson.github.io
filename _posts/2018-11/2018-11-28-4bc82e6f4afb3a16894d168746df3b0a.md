The recent ABC News article *Australia’s pollution mapped by postcode reveals nation’s dirty truth* is interesting. It contains a searchable table, which is useful if you want to look up your own suburb. However, I was left wanting more: specifically, the raw data and some nice maps.

So here’s how I got them, using R.



The full details are in this Github repository. There you’ll find the code to generate this report.

Essentially, the procedure goes like this:

1. Use `rvest` to create a data frame from the data table in the online article

1. Clean and pre-process the data using `dplyr`

1. Join the pollution data with geospatial data derived from a shapefile of Australian postal areas

1. Filter by postcode range for the city of interest

1. And finally plot maps using `ggplot2`

Rather than copying/pasting/formatting code here, I encourage you to look at the report.

Result: maps, like the one on the right. I sometimes think R makes this kind of thing almost too easy.
