Here’s a great opportunity for those interested in probabilistic programming and workflows for Bayesian data analysis:

We (including me, Aki) are looking for outstanding postdoctoral researchers and research fellows to work for a new exciting project in the crossroads of probabilistic programming, simulator-based inference and user interfaces. You will have an opportunity to work with top research groups in Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence, including both Aalto University and at the University of Helsinki and to cooperate with several industry partners.

The topics for which we are recruiting are

 Machine learning for simulator-based inference
 Intelligent user interfaces and techniques for interacting with AI
 *Interactive workflow support for probabilistic programming based modeling*
