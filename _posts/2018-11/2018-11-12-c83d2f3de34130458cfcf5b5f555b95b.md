Amazon Polly is an AWS service that turns text into lifelike speech. This pre-trained service requires no machine learning skills to easily integrate AI into your applications.

In addition to the previously available Italian voices Carla and Giorgio, we have now added a second female Italian voice. Listen to the introduction by Bianca.

We have also added Lucia, a second female Castilian Spanish voice. Listen to the introduction by Lucia.

In addition, we are introducing Mia, our first Mexican Spanish voice, which expands our portfolio of Spanish options beyond Castilian and US Spanish.

With these additions, the Amazon Polly portfolio now includes 57 voices across 28 languages. Visit the Amazon Polly documentation for the full list of text-to-speech voices, and log in to the Amazon Polly console to try them out!
