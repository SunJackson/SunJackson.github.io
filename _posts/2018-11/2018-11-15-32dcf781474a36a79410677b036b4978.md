**Correction of AI systems by linear discriminants: Probabilistic foundations**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems sometimes make errors and will make errors in the future, from time to time. These errors are usually unexpected, and can lead to dramatic consequences. Intensive development of AI and its practical applications makes the problem of errors more important. Total re-engineering of the systems can create new errors and is not always possible due to the resources involved. The important challenge is to develop fast methods to correct errors without damaging existing skills. We formulated the technical requirements to the ‘ideal’ correctors. Such correctors include binary classifiers, which separate the situations with high risk of errors from the situations where the AI systems work properly. Surprisingly, for essentially high-dimensional data such methods are possible: simple linear Fisher discriminant can separate the situations with errors from correctly solved tasks even for exponentially large samples. The paper presents the probabilistic basis for fast non-destructive correction of AI systems. A series of new stochastic separation theorems is proven. These theorems provide new instruments for fast non-iterative correction of errors of legacy AI systems. The new approaches become efficient in high-dimensions, for correction of high-dimensional systems in high-dimensional world (i.e. for processing of essentially high-dimensional data by large systems).

**Learning From Positive and Unlabeled Data: A Survey**

Learning from positive and unlabeled data or PU learning is the setting where a learner only has access to positive examples and unlabeled data. The assumption is that the unlabeled data can contain both positive and negative examples. This setting has attracted increasing interest within the machine learning literature as this type of data naturally arises in applications such as medical diagnosis and knowledge base completion. This article provides a survey of the current state of the art in PU learning. It proposes seven key research questions that commonly arise in this field and provides a broad overview of how the field has tried to address them.

**Assessing biological models using topological data analysis**

We use topological data analysis as a tool to analyze the fit of mathematical models to experimental data. This study is built on data obtained from motion tracking groups of aphids in [Nilsen et al., PLOS One, 2013] and two random walk models that were proposed to describe the data. One model incorporates social interactions between the insects, and the second model is a control model that excludes these interactions. We compare data from each model to data from experiment by performing statistical tests based on three different sets of measures. First, we use time series of order parameters commonly used in collective motion studies. These order parameters measure the overall polarization and angular momentum of the group, and do not rely on a priori knowledge of the models that produced the data. Second, we use order parameter time series that do rely on a priori knowledge, namely average distance to nearest neighbor and percentage of aphids moving. Third, we use computational persistent homology to calculate topological signatures of the data. Analysis of the a priori order parameters indicates that the interactive model better describes the experimental data than the control model does. The topological approach performs as well as these a priori order parameters and better than the other order parameters, suggesting the utility of the topological approach in the absence of specific knowledge of mechanisms underlying the data.

**A Perceptual Prediction Framework for Self Supervised Event Segmentation**

Temporal segmentation of long videos is an important problem, that has largely been tackled through supervised learning, often requiring large amounts of annotated training data. In this paper, we tackle the problem of self-supervised temporal segmentation of long videos that alleviate the need for any supervision. We introduce a self-supervised, predictive learning framework that draws inspiration from cognitive psychology to segment long, visually complex videos into individual, stable segments that share the same semantics. We also introduce a new adaptive learning paradigm that helps reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets – Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and INRIA Instructional Videos datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach. We show that the proposed approach is able to outperform weakly-supervised and other unsupervised learning approaches by up to 24% and have competitive performance compared to fully supervised approaches. We also show that the proposed approach is able to learn highly discriminative features that help improve action recognition when used in a representation learning paradigm.

**Characterizing machine learning process: A maturity framework**

Academic literature on machine learning modeling fails to address how to make machine learning models work for enterprises. For example, existing machine learning processes cannot address how to define business use cases for an AI application, how to convert business requirements from offering managers into data requirements for data scientists, and how to continuously improve AI applications in term of accuracy and fairness, and how to customize general purpose machine learning models with industry, domain, and use case specific data to make them more accurate for specific situations etc. Making AI work for enterprises requires special considerations, tools, methods and processes. In this paper we present a maturity framework for machine learning model lifecycle management for enterprises. Our framework is a re-interpretation of the software Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for machine learning model development process. We present a set of best practices from our personal experience of building large scale real-world machine learning models to help organizations achieve higher levels of maturity independent of their starting point.

**The doctrinal paradox: ROC analysis in a probabilistic framework**

The doctrinal paradox is analysed from a probabilistic point of view assuming a simple parametric model for the committee’s behaviour. The well known issue-by-issue and case-by-case majority rules are compared in this model, by means of the concepts of false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR) and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) space. We introduce also a new rule that we call path-by-path, which is somehow halfway between the other two. Under our model assumptions, the issue-by-issue rule is shown to be the best of the three according to an optimality criterion based in ROC maps, for all values of the model parameters (committee size and competence of its members), when equal weight is given to FPR an FNR. For unequal weights, the relative goodness of the rules depends on the values of the competence and the weights, in a way which is precisely described. The results are illustrated with some numerical examples.

**TED: Teaching AI to Explain its Decisions**

Artificial intelligence systems are being increasingly deployed due to their potential to increase the efficiency, scale, consistency, fairness, and accuracy of decisions. However, as many of these systems are opaque in their operation, there is a growing demand for such systems to provide explanations for their decisions. Conventional approaches to this problem attempt to expose or discover the inner workings of a machine learning model with the hope that the resulting explanations will be meaningful to the consumer. In contrast, this paper suggests a new approach to this problem. It introduces a simple, practical framework, called Teaching Explanations for Decisions (TED), that provides meaningful explanations that match the mental model of the consumer. We illustrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach with two different examples, resulting in highly accurate explanations with no loss of prediction accuracy for these two examples.

**Learning Temporal Point Processes via Reinforcement Learning**

Social goods, such as healthcare, smart city, and information networks, often produce ordered event data in continuous time. The generative processes of these event data can be very complex, requiring flexible models to capture their dynamics. Temporal point processes offer an elegant framework for modeling event data without discretizing the time. However, the existing maximum-likelihood-estimation (MLE) learning paradigm requires hand-crafting the intensity function beforehand and cannot directly monitor the goodness-of-fit of the estimated model in the process of training. To alleviate the risk of model-misspecification in MLE, we propose to generate samples from the generative model and monitor the quality of the samples in the process of training until the samples and the real data are indistinguishable. We take inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) and treat the generation of each event as the action taken by a stochastic policy. We parameterize the policy as a flexible recurrent neural network and gradually improve the policy to mimic the observed event distribution. Since the reward function is unknown in this setting, we uncover an analytic and nonparametric form of the reward function using an inverse reinforcement learning formulation. This new RL framework allows us to derive an efficient policy gradient algorithm for learning flexible point process models, and we show that it performs well in both synthetic and real data.

**Dynamic Feature Scaling for K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**

Nearest Neighbors Algorithm is a Lazy Learning Algorithm, in which the algorithm tries to approximate the predictions with the help of similar existing vectors in the training dataset. The predictions made by the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is based on averaging the target values of the spatial neighbors. The selection process for neighbors in the Hermitian space is done with the help of distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, Mahalanobis distance etc. A majority of the metrics such as Euclidean distance are scale variant, meaning that the results could vary for different range of values used for the features. Standard techniques used for the normalization of scaling factors are feature scaling method such as Z-score normalization technique, Min-Max scaling etc. Scaling methods uniformly assign equal weights to all the features, which might result in a non-ideal situation. This paper proposes a novel method to assign weights to individual feature with the help of out of bag errors obtained from constructing multiple decision tree models.

**PanJoin: A Partition-based Adaptive Stream Join**

In stream processing, stream join is one of the critical sources of performance bottlenecks. The sliding-window-based stream join provides a precise result but consumes considerable computational resources. The current solutions lack support for the join predicates on large windows. These algorithms and their hardware accelerators are either limited to equi-join or use a nested loop join to process all the requests. In this paper, we present a new algorithm called PanJoin which has high throughput on large windows and supports both equi-join and non-equi-join. PanJoin implements three new data structures to reduce computations during the probing phase of stream join. We also implement the most hardware-friendly data structure, called BI-Sort, on FPGA. Our evaluation shows that PanJoin outperforms several recently proposed stream join methods by more than 1000x, and it also adapts well to highly skewed data.

**Theoretical Analysis of Adversarial Learning: A Minimax Approach**

We propose a general theoretical method for analyzing the risk bound in the presence of adversaries. In particular, we try to fit the adversarial learning problem into the minimax framework. We first show that the original adversarial learning problem could be reduced to a minimax statistical learning problem by introducing a transport map between distributions. Then we prove a risk bound for this minimax problem in terms of covering numbers. In contrast to previous minimax bounds in \cite{lee,far}, our bound is informative when the radius of the ambiguity set is small. Our method could be applied to multi-class classification problems and commonly-used loss functions such as hinge loss and ramp loss. As two illustrative examples, we derive the adversarial risk bounds for kernel-SVM and deep neural networks. Our results indicate that a stronger adversary might have a negative impact on the complexity of the hypothesis class and the existence of margin could serve as a defense mechanism to counter adversarial attacks.

**A Multi-layer LSTM-based Approach for Robot Command Interaction Modeling**

As the first robotic platforms slowly approach our everyday life, we can imagine a near future where service robots will be easily accessible by non-expert users through vocal interfaces. The capability of managing natural language would indeed speed up the process of integrating such platform in the ordinary life. Semantic parsing is a fundamental task of the Natural Language Understanding process, as it allows extracting the meaning of a user utterance to be used by a machine. In this paper, we present a preliminary study to semantically parse user vocal commands for a House Service robot, using a multi-layer Long-Short Term Memory neural network with attention mechanism. The system is trained on the Human Robot Interaction Corpus, and it is preliminarily compared with previous approaches.

**Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders in High Performance Computing Systems**

Anomaly detection in supercomputers is a very difficult problem due to the big scale of the systems and the high number of components. The current state of the art for automated anomaly detection employs Machine Learning methods or statistical regression models in a supervised fashion, meaning that the detection tool is trained to distinguish among a fixed set of behaviour classes (healthy and unhealthy states). We propose a novel approach for anomaly detection in High Performance Computing systems based on a Machine (Deep) Learning technique, namely a type of neural network called autoencoder. The key idea is to train a set of autoencoders to learn the normal (healthy) behaviour of the supercomputer nodes and, after training, use them to identify abnormal conditions. This is different from previous approaches which where based on learning the abnormal condition, for which there are much smaller datasets (since it is very hard to identify them to begin with). We test our approach on a real supercomputer equipped with a fine-grained, scalable monitoring infrastructure that can provide large amount of data to characterize the system behaviour. The results are extremely promising: after the training phase to learn the normal system behaviour, our method is capable of detecting anomalies that have never been seen before with a very good accuracy (values ranging between 88% and 96%).
