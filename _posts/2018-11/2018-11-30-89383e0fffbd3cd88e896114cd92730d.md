**Text Morphing** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In this paper, we introduce a novel natural language generation task, termed as text morphing, which targets at generating the intermediate sentences that are fluency and smooth with the two input sentences. We propose the Morphing Networks consisting of the editing vector generation networks and the sentence editing networks which are trained jointly. Specifically, the editing vectors are generated with a recurrent neural networks model from the lexical gap between the source sentence and the target sentence. Then the sentence editing networks iteratively generate new sentences with the current editing vector and the sentence generated in the previous step. We conduct experiments with 10 million text morphing sequences which are extracted from the Yelp review dataset. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines on the text morphing task. We also discuss directions and opportunities for future research of text morphing. … 

**Incremental IRL (I2RL)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of learning the preferences of an agent from the observations of its behavior on a task. While this problem has been well investigated, the related problem of {\em online} IRL—where the observations are incrementally accrued, yet the demands of the application often prohibit a full rerun of an IRL method—has received relatively less attention. We introduce the first formal framework for online IRL, called incremental IRL (I2RL), and a new method that advances maximum entropy IRL with hidden variables, to this setting. Our formal analysis shows that the new method has a monotonically improving performance with more demonstration data, as well as probabilistically bounded error, both under full and partial observability. Experiments in a simulated robotic application of penetrating a continuous patrol under occlusion shows the relatively improved performance and speed up of the new method and validates the utility of online IRL. … 

**Configural Frequency Analysis (CFA)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Configural frequency analysis (CFA) is a method of exploratory data analysis, introduced by Gustav A. Lienert in 1969. The goal of a configural frequency analysis is to detect patterns in the data that occur significantly more (such patterns are called Types) or significantly less often (such patterns are called Antitypes) than expected by chance. Thus, the idea of a CFA is to provide by the identified types and antitypes some insight into the structure of the data. Types are interpreted as concepts which are constituted by a pattern of variable values. Antitypes are interpreted as patterns of variable values that do in general not occur together. …
