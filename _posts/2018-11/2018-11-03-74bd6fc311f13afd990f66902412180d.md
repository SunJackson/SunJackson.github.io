GHCN  version 4   beta is available.  Using the GHS  population dataset the ~27000  GHCNV4 sites were filtered  to collect only rural stations.   GHS  combines two datasets,  a  10meter  built surface  satellite dataset and a human population dataset.   https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/.    using site locations the population within 10km  of the site was extracted.  two cases were considered:  A case where rual was defined as  less than 16 people per sq km, and a case where there were less than 7 people  per sq km, this filtering led to two subsets of the  ~27K  ghcnv4 stations. One with 15K stations and a second with 12K stations.   The temperature data used was the unadjusted  monthly T Avg.
