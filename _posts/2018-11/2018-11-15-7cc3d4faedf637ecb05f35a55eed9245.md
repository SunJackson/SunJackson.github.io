“There is a dizzying array of algorithms from which to choose, and just making the choice between them presupposes that you have sufficiently advanced mathematical background to understand the alternatives and make a rational choice. The options are also changing, evolving constantly as a result of the work of some very bright, very dedicated researchers who are continually refining existing algorithms and coming up with new ones.” Ted Dunning, Ellen Friedman ( 2014 )
