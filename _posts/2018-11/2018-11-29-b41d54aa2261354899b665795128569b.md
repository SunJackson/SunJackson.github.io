Hi, internet! DataCamp launches at least one DataCamp project a month that is topical for that specific month, and **you** (yes, *you*) should create one for January 2019. For example, in October, we launched a Halloween-related project called Explore 538’s Halloween Candy Rankings by Nick Solomon. In that project, DataCamp subscribers can explore a dataset that contains information about all different kinds of candy. Is it chocolaty? How does the cost compare to other candies? How many people prefer this candy over another? The project wraps up by using linear regression to predict candy popularity and logistic regression to predict whether a candy is chocolaty or not.

*The first task in the Explore 538’s Halloween Candy Rankings project.*

Sounds like fun, right? Well, it is! **And the good news is you can get in on this too and have your project launch in January 2019**. As explained in a previous blog post (How is content created at DataCamp?), DataCamp outsources our instructors and uses an in-house Content Team to guide instructors through the creation process. The benefits of being a DataCamp project instructor are many, as explained in this job posting. It takes 10-24 hours over 4-8 weeks to create most DataCamp projects, depending on the experience of the instructor, if the project is being converted from another format (e.g., blog post), etc., which is why this request for proposals was sent out in November.

Are you interested in creating a topical project for January 2019? Great!

## Potential topical project ideas

We did some work for you already, using DataCamp’s internal brainpower to generate potential topical project ideas. Here they are, verbatim:

### A Super Bowl project

The Super Bowl is February 3, 2019 for this NFL season.

- "Something about the Super Bowl"


### A New Year’s Resolutions project

January is the month of started (and failed?) New Year’s resolutions.

- "Predicting the success rate of new year’s resolutions"

- "New Year’s resolutions: survivorship curves, scraping twitter data about them, etc."

- "Survival analysis of gym attendance"

- "New Year’s resolutions theme. What are the most common? How soon are people to drop them?"


### A War and Peace project

War and Peace will be published 150 years ago come 2019. It is regarded as a central work of world literature and one of Leo Tolstoy’s finest literary achievements.

- "Text analysis of War and Peace"


### A Chinese New Year project

Chinese New Year 2019 is February 5. 2019 is the Year of the Pig.

- "Chinese New Year is Feb 5th"


## How to submit your project idea

- Fill out this application form.

- If you have a topical idea but don’t want to apply yourself, post it in the comments.

- If you know of a great existing blog post, paper, etc. that covers something topical for January 2019, it can likely be converted to a DataCamp project so post it in the comments, and we’ll reach out to the author.


## What is a DataCamp project?

DataCamp projects are where students can **apply** several of skills they **learned** in DataCamp courses in real-world, end-to-end data analyses. If you’re a DataCamp subscriber, take a look at our ever-growing project library, otherwise, take one of our free projects below. If you want more, this article outlines projects in detail and the pedagogical advantages of the product.

- Rise and Fall of Programming Languages (an R project by DataCamp’s Chief Data Scientist, David Robinson)
