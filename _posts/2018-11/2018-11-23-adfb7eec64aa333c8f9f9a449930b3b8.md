“Data science, surprisingly perhaps, is not about designing the most advanced machine learning algorithms and training them on all of the data (and then having Skynet). It’s about finding the right data, becoming a quasi-expert on the process, system, or event you are trying to model, and crafting features that will help quirky and sometimes frail statistical algorithms make accurate predictions. Very little time is actually spent on the algorithm itself.” Scott W. Strong ( April 10, 2018 )
