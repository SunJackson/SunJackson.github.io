Imagine you are a fish ecologist who compiled a list of fish species for your country. ðŸ�ŸYour list could be useful to others, so you publish it as a supplementary file to an article or in a research repository. That is fantastic, but it might be difficult for others to discover your list or combine it with other lists of species. Luckily thereâ€™s a better way to publish species lists: as a standardized checklist that can be harvested and processed by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).
