A new RcppArmadillo release arrived at CRAN overnight. The version 0.9.200.5.0 is a minor upgrade and based on the new Armadillo bugfix release 9.200.5 from yesterday. I also just uploaded the Debian version.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and language–and is widely used by (currently) 539 other packages on CRAN.

This release just brings one upstream bug fix, see below for details.

Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.9.200.5.0 (2018-11-09)

- Upgraded to Armadillo release 9.200.5 (Carpe Noctem)



Courtesy of CRANberries, there is a diffstat report relative to previous release. More detailed information is on the RcppArmadillo page. Questions, comments etc should go to the rcpp-devel mailing list off the R-Forge page.
