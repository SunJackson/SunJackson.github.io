In today’s world, data analytics is crucial for measuring success. With data analytics, companies can carefully examine information from a specific marketing campaign, for example, and get guidance as to what’s performing well and what isn’t. By carefully analyzing important data, companies are better equipped for setting up future campaigns and goals.

However, data analysis is a complex field; it is both an art and a science. It takes the knowledge and expertise of a skilled data analytics professional to effectively analyze this important data. By enrolling in an online course, you can gain the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in this growing field. If you’re brand new to data analytics, it can be helpful to start with a basic course that covers the fundamentals, such as Business Analytics Certification Training with Excel. If you’d rather start with something more challenging, you can dive into one of Simplilearn’s advanced courses, such as their Data Science with Python Certification Training or Data Science Certification Training - R Programming courses.

If you already have experience or you’re ready to take on some of their most challenging programs, some top choices include their Big Data Architect and Data Scientist Masters Programs.

As a data analytics professional, your main objective is to organize and analyze large amounts of data, often using software specifically designed for the task. The final results of your analysis needs to be easy enough for all invested stakeholders to understand — especially those working outside of IT.

### **Why to go for a Data Analytics Certification?**

Data analytics is a fast growing field, and as more and more companies are recognizing the need to implement data analytics into their daily operations, more positions in this industry are opening up. If you’re looking for a little more motivation, the following are eight reasons to get into data analytics, and how a data analytics certification can boost your career:

1. **High demand for analytics professionals**


The current demand for qualified data professionals is just the beginning. Technology professionals who are experienced in analytics are in high demand, as organizations are looking for ways to exploit the power of big data. The number of jobs in the  Big Data industry has increased by 106% from the year of 2014 to 2017 substantially . This apparent surge is due to the increased number of organizations implementing analytics and thereby looking for analytics professionals. Through a study from QuinStreet Inc., it was revealed that the trend of implementing big data analytics is growing and is considered to be a high priority among U.S. businesses. A majority of the organizations are either in the process of implementing it, or they’re actively planning to add this feature within the next two years.



- **Huge Job Opportunities & Meeting the Skill Gap**

The demand for analytics professionals is increasing steadily, but there is a huge deficit on the supply side. This is happening globally and is not restricted to any part of the world. In spite of Big Data Analytics being an in-demand position, there is still a large number of unfilled jobs across the globe due to a shortage of required skills. Those interested in learning the skills needed for this quickly-growing profession can learn everything they need through an online certification course.

A McKinsey Global Institute study states that the U.S. will face a shortage of about 190,000 data scientists and 1.5 million managers and analysts who can understand and make decisions using big data by 2018. India currently has the highest concentration of analytics globally. Despite this, the scarcity of data analytics talent is particularly acute, and demand for talent is expected to be on the higher side as more global organizations are outsourcing their work.

1. **Salary Aspects**


Strong demand for data analytics skills is boosting the wages for qualified professionals. According to the 2015 Skills and Salary Survey Report  by cmo.com that the Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA) published, the annual median salary for data analysts is $130,000: a four percent increase from last year. A look at the salary trend for big data analytics in the UK also indicates positive and exponential growth. A quick search on Itjobswatch.co.uk shows a median salary of £62,500 in early 2016 for big data analytics jobs, as compared to £55,000 in 2015. A year-on-year median salary change of +13.63% is also observed.

1. **Big data analytics is a top priority in a lot of organizations**


About 77% of top organizations consider data analytics a critical factor of their business growth. As a big data analytics professional, you will be analyzing an immense volume of data in order to arrive at critical business insights, which can have a huge impact on a company’s policy and marketing strategies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 9 percent of those working in computer and math occupations were certified in their field. It’s not enough to simply learn the skills needed to succeed in this industry. In order to rise above the competition and stand out, it’s crucial to also get certified.

1. **Flexibility of working in any sector**


As a data analytics professional, you’re not usually limited to working in a particular industry, which can be a huge advantage. Every industry benefits from data analytics. Some of the core industries where you can see a high demand for data analytics professionals include financial, healthcare, retail, logistics and human resource management. For example, if an online retailer launches an AdWords campaign, a data analyst can be an invaluable asset by evaluating the data from that campaign. This can allow the retailer to see what worked, what didn’t, and how future campaigns should be executed.

1. **Better practical knowledge**


One of the best parts about e-learning is that you get the opportunity to learn from industry professionals who have worked in the same field for years. You get to learn and work with the marketing tools that are used widely. For instance, in a web analytics course, students may get the opportunity to work with an actual Google Analytics account—a tool that they would likely use once they’re working in a data analyst position.

1. **Structured learning approach**


By undergoing structured data analytics certification courses, you learn each of the major fields of data analytics in an organized, logical manner. Given how dynamic the industry is, having this structure while you are learning is crucial. Otherwise, if you just learn by reading a blog or watching a video, you only get pieces of information, and you don’t build a deep understanding of how everything works.

1. **No prerequisites for taking the certification**


Almost anyone can learn and complete a data analytics certification. It does not require any prerequisites. You can be fresh out of college looking to learn something new. As long as you invest the time and effort needed to succeed in the course, you should be able to get your certification. And more importantly, you’ll build the skills needed for becoming a successful data analytics professional.

If you’re ready to get certified in data analytics, the next step is finding a course that will offer you that certification. When it comes to selecting a data analytics education program, the options can be overwhelming. Ideally, you’ll want to find a program that is available entirely online. This offers an unbeatable convenience that on-site courses simply cannot provide: the ability to learn a new skill from anywhere in the world and at your own pace, all according to your schedule. Even if your life seems chaotic lately and you’re busy around the clock, with an online program, there are no excuses.

Next, you want to find an online program that is known for being a reputable source for online learning. Read reviews and ask for recommendations - not only for the course you’re considering, but for the learning institution itself. You’ll also want to learn more about the teachers and their backgrounds, so that you can understand more about who you’ll be learning from.

It’s also important to find an online data analytics program that provides several options, depending on how familiar you are with data analytics and what your goals are. Simplilearn offers a wide range of data analytics course to choose from. Browse their course catalog today to learn more about the different education programs available.
