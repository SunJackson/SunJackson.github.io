**Innovation Representation of Stochastic Processes with Application to Causal Inference**

Typically, real-world stochastic processes are not easy to analyze. In this work we study the representation of any stochastic process as a memoryless innovation process triggering a dynamic system. We show that such a representation is always feasible for innovation processes taking values over a continuous set. However, the problem becomes more challenging when the alphabet size of the innovation is finite. In this case, we introduce both lossless and lossy frameworks, and provide closed-form solutions and practical algorithmic methods. In addition, we discuss the properties and uniqueness of our suggested approach. Finally, we show that the innovation representation problem has many applications. We focus our attention to Entropic Causal Inference, which has recently demonstrated promising performance, compared to alternative methods.

**Evoplex: A platform for agent-based modeling on networks**

Evoplex is a fast, robust and extensible platform for developing agent-based models and multi-agent systems on networks. Each agent is represented as a node and interacts with its neighbors, as defined by the network structure. Evoplex is ideal for modeling complex systems, for example in evolutionary game theory and computational social science. In Evoplex, the models are not coupled to the execution parameters or the visualization tools, and there is a user-friendly graphical user interface which makes it easy for all users, ranging from newcomers to experienced, to create, analyze, replicate and reproduce the experiments.

**Please Stop Explaining Black Box Models for High Stakes Decisions**

There are black box models now being used for high stakes decision-making throughout society. The practice of trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practices and can potentially cause catastrophic harm to society. There is a way forward — it is to design models that are inherently interpretable.

**Attentive Long Short-Term Preference Modeling for Personalized Product Search**

E-commerce users may expect different products even for the same query, due to their diverse personal preferences. It is well-known that there are two types of preferences: long-term ones and short-term ones. The former refers to user’ inherent purchasing bias and evolves slowly. By contrast, the latter reflects users’ purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both affect users’ current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To this end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed as ALSTP, for personalized product search. Our model adopts the neural networks approach to learn and integrate the long- and short-term user preferences with the current query for the personalized product search. In particular, two attention networks are designed to distinguish which factors in the short-term as well as long-term user preferences are more relevant to the current query. This unique design enables our model to capture users’ current search intentions more accurately. Our work is the first to apply attention mechanisms to integrate both long- and short-term user preferences with the given query for the personalized search. Extensive experiments over four Amazon product datasets show that our model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art product search methods in terms of different evaluation metrics.

**Rare Events Analysis in Stochastic Models for Bacterial Evolution**

Radical shifts in the genetic composition of large cell populations are rare events with quite low probabilities, which direct numerical simulations generally fail to evaluate accurately. We develop a large deviations framework for a class of Markov chains modeling genetic evolution of bacteria such as E. coli. In particular, we develop the cost functional and a backward search algorithm for discrete-time Markov chains which describe daily evolution of histograms of bacterial populations.

**Ontology Matching Techniques: A Gold Standard Model**

Typically an ontology matching technique is a combination of much different type of matchers operating at various abstraction levels such as structure, semantic, syntax, instance etc. An ontology matching technique which employs matchers at all possible abstraction levels is expected to give, in general, best results in terms of precision, recall and F-measure due to improvement in matching opportunities and if we discount efficiency issues which may improve with better computing resources such as parallel processing. A gold standard ontology matching model is derived from a model classification of ontology matching techniques. A suitable metric is also defined based on gold standard ontology matching model. A review of various ontology matching techniques specified in recent research papers in the area was undertaken to categorize an ontology matching technique as per newly proposed gold standard model and a metric value for the whole group was computed. The results of the above study support proposed gold standard ontology matching model.

**Bull Bear Balance: A Cluster Analysis of Socially Informed Financial Volatility**

Using a method rooted in information theory, we present results that have identified a large set of stocks for which social media can be informative regarding financial volatility. By clustering stocks based on the joint feature sets of social and financial variables, our research provides an important contribution by characterizing the conditions in which social media signals can lead financial volatility. The results indicate that social media is most informative about financial market volatility when the ratio of bullish to bearish sentiment is high, even when the number of messages is low. The robustness of these findings is verified across 500 stocks from both NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. The reported results are reproducible via an open-source library for social-financial analysis made freely available.

**InstaNAS: Instance-aware Neural Architecture Search**

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims at finding one ‘single’ architecture that achieves the best accuracy for a given task such as image recognition.In this paper, we study the instance-level variation,and demonstrate that instance-awareness is an important yet currently missing component of NAS. Based on this observation, we propose InstaNAS for searching toward instance-level architectures;the controller is trained to search and form a ‘distribution of architectures’ instead of a single final architecture. Then during the inference phase, the controller selects an architecture from the distribution, tailored for each unseen image to achieve both high accuracy and short latency. The experimental results show that InstaNAS reduces the inference latency without compromising classification accuracy. On average, InstaNAS achieves 48.9% latency reduction on CIFAR-10 and 40.2% latency reduction on CIFAR-100 with respect to MobileNetV2 architecture.

**Control with Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning: Learn a Better Policy**

Distributed approach is a very effective method to improve training efficiency of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, in which a PSO based network update mechanism is adopted to speed up learning an optimal policy besides using multiple agents for parallel training. In this mechanism, the update of neural network of each agent is not only according to the training result of itself, but also affected by the optimal neural network of all agents. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the proposed architecture is implemented on the Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) and the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to train several typical control problems. The training results show that the proposed method is effective.

**Autonomous Systems — An Architectural Characterization**

The concept of autonomy is key to the IoT vision promising increasing integration of smart services and systems minimizing human intervention. This vision challenges our capability to build complex open trustworthy autonomous systems. We lack a rigorous common semantic framework for autonomous systems. It is remarkable that the debate about autonomous vehicles focuses almost exclusively on AI and learning techniques while it ignores many other equally important autonomous system design issues. Autonomous systems involve agents and objects coordinated in some common environment so that their collective behavior meets a set of global goals. We propose a general computational model combining a system architecture model and an agent model. The architecture model allows expression of dynamic reconfigurable multi-mode coordination between components. The agent model consists of five interacting modules implementing each one a characteristic function: Perception, Reflection, Goal management, Planning and Self-adaptation. It determines a concept of autonomic complexity accounting for the specific difficulty to build autonomous systems. We emphasize that the main characteristic of autonomous systems is their ability to handle knowledge and adaptively respond to environment changes. We advocate that autonomy should be associated with functionality and not with specific techniques. Machine learning is essential for autonomy although it can meet only a small portion of the needs implied by autonomous system design. We conclude that autonomy is a kind of broad intelligence. Building trustworthy and optimal autonomous systems goes far beyond the AI challenge.

**Bayesian Nonparametric Analysis of Multivariate Time Series: A Matrix Gamma Process Approach**

While there is an increasing amount of literature about Bayesian time series analysis, only a few Bayesian nonparametric approaches to multivariate time series exist. Most methods rely on Whittle’s Likelihood, involving the second order structure of a stationary time series by means of its spectral density matrix. This is often modeled in terms of the Cholesky decomposition to ensure positive definiteness. However, asymptotic properties such as posterior consistency or posterior contraction rates are not known. A different idea is to model the spectral density matrix by means of random measures. This is in line with existing approaches for the univariate case, where the normalized spectral density is modeled similar to a probability density, e.g. with a Dirichlet process mixture of Beta densities. In this work, we present a related approach for multivariate time series, with matrix-valued mixture weights induced by a Hermitian positive definite Gamma process. The proposed procedure is shown to perform well for both simulated and real data. Posterior consistency and contraction rates are also established.

**Non-deterministic inference using random set models: theory, approximation, and sampling method**

A random set is a generalisation of a random variable, i.e. a set-valued random variable. The random set theory allows a unification of other uncertainty descriptions such as interval variable, mass belief function in Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, possibility theory, and set of probability distributions. The aim of this work is to develop a non-deterministic inference framework, including theory, approximation and sampling method, that deals with the inverse problems in which uncertainty is represented using random sets. The proposed inference method yields the posterior random set based on the intersection of the prior and the measurement induced random sets. That inference method is an extension of Dempster’s rule of combination, and a generalisation of Bayesian inference as well. A direct evaluation of the posterior random set might be impractical. We approximate the posterior random set by a random discrete set whose domain is the set of samples generated using a proposed probability distribution. We use the capacity transform density function of the posterior random set for this proposed distribution. This function has a special property: it is the posterior density function yielded by Bayesian inference of the capacity transform density function of the prior random set. The samples of such proposed probability distribution can be directly obtained using the methods developed in the Bayesian inference framework. With this approximation method, the evaluation of the posterior random set becomes tractable.

**Minimum reversion in multivariate time series**

We propose a new multivariate time series model in which we assume that each component has a tendency to revert to the minimum of all components. Such a specification is useful to describe phenomena where each member in a population which is subjected to random noise mimics the behaviour of the best performing member. We show that the proposed dynamics generate co-integrated processes.We characterize the model’s asymptotic properties for the case of two populations and show a stabilizing effect on long term dynamics in simulation studies. An empirical study involving human survival data in different countries provides an example which confirms the occurrence of the phenomenon of reversion to the minimum in real data.
