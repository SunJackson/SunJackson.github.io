Together, we’ll use data science, machine learning, and analytics to improve healthcare outcomes.

Highlights of the book include:

- **Set up the toolbox:**Set up the Anaconda distribution of Python as well as Jupyter notebook and SQLite with step-by-step instructions (Chapter 1).

- **Caring about healthcare:**An A to Z primer on healthcare including topics such as financing, policy, HIPAA, clinical coding systems, and how clinical data travels from the patient to the computer (Chapter 2).

- **Thinking like the physician:**Learn how physicians are trained to approach clinical cases and how this relates to machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks (Chapter 3).

- **Set the clinical table:**Learn SQL by example and use it to munge a mini clinical database of cardiology patients (Chapter 4).

- **Don’t mind the Python:**A tutorial on the Python programming language (Chapter 5), including syntax, data types and containers, and scripts.

- **Getting friendly with pandas:**Learn how to wrangle data quickly and easily using the popular pandas library (Chapter 5).

- **Caring about quality**: See how governmental incentive programs are creating opportunities for providers to get reimbursed financially (Chapter 6).

- **Emergency Department modeling:**Join us as we build a predictive model in Python from start to finish, from downloading the data to measuring model performance (Chapter 7).

- **Real-world modeling:**Read how recent machine learning studies are redefining clinical practice and knowledge in the areas of heart disease, cancer, and readmission prediction (Chapter 8).

- **The chosen future:**Discuss the most recent advances in healthcare analytics and discuss barriers to adoption (Chapter 9).


All in all, *Healthcare Analytics Made Simple* is a valuable resource for any data scientist interested in healthcare.  Buy your copy today at Amazon or Packtpub.com.
