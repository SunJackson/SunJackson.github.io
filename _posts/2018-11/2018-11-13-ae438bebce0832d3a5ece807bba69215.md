Help us understand your Data Science goals! 


Spend 5-10 mins and you can win one of twenty $50 Amazon gift certificates.


KDnuggets and partners are looking to do some data science market research with your help. In particular, we are trying to learn more about the preferences of students who are currently enrolled in or have completed either **shorter, online courses in data science** (e.g., less than 100 hours of content over <3 months such as Coursera, Udemy, or Udacity) or **intensive, paid online bootcamps in data science** (e.g., programs with 300+ hours of content over 5+ months such as Flatiron, Springboard, or Thinkful).


If you have enrolled in one of these bootcamps, we would love to understand more about what you were looking for in a data science program and what made you choose the program you did.


Please take ~5-10 min to **fill out the survey at this link** for a chance to win one of **twenty $50 Amazon gift cards** that we'll be giving out.


We look forward to hearing from you.
