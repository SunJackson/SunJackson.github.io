Data-driven business is the new norm. With the Information Economy well underway, today's innovators are cleverly using data to steer every aspect of their business. To navigate that course, organizations need self-service environments that don't compromise the data governance needed to keep data (and decisions) accurate. This need to maintain a single source of truth that everyone can leverage has lead to innovative new practices in analytics overall.


In this webinar we will walk you though the evolution of BI and how new technologies have paved the way for modern data platforms like Looker that can serve the data needs of an entire company. Built on today's technology, Looker offers a balance of self-service and governance with access to a single-source of truth.
