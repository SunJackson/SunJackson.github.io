Explore how the role of build engineering is evolving to reconcile two key trends: massive wide-scale adoption of open source; the most devastating cyber-attacks in recent history tied to unpatched dependencies and other vulnerabilities.

Reconciling these trends will enable enterprises to unlock the the potential of open source and mitigate the risks. Further, our expert panelists will dive into how automating build engineering can accelerate your build time to gain speed & predictability in your open source language build pipeline and decrease the risk to deployed applications.
