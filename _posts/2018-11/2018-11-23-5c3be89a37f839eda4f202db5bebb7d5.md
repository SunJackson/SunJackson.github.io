**Double Path Networks for Sequence to Sequence Learning (DPN-S2S)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Encoder-decoder based Sequence to Sequence learning (S2S) has made remarkable progress in recent years. Different network architectures have been used in the encoder/decoder. Among them, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Self Attention Networks (SAN) are the prominent ones. The two architectures achieve similar performances but use very different ways to encode and decode context: CNN use convolutional layers to focus on the local connectivity of the sequence, while SAN uses self-attention layers to focus on global semantics. In this work we propose Double Path Networks for Sequence to Sequence learning (DPN-S2S), which leverage the advantages of both models by using double path information fusion. During the encoding step, we develop a double path architecture to maintain the information coming from different paths with convolutional layers and self-attention layers separately. To effectively use the encoded context, we develop a cross attention module with gating and use it to automatically pick up the information needed during the decoding step. By deeply integrating the two paths with cross attention, both types of information are combined and well exploited. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of sequence to sequence learning over state-of-the-art systems. … 

**Multi-Output Convolution Spectral Mixture Kernel (MOCSM)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) are recently extended by using spectral mixture kernel, which enables expressively pattern extrapolation with a strong interpretation. In particular, Multi-Output Spectral Mixture kernel (MOSM) is a recent, powerful state of the art method. However, MOSM cannot reduce to the ordinary spectral mixture kernel (SM) when using a single channel. Moreover, when the spectral density of different channels is either very close or very far from each other in the frequency domain, MOSM generates unreasonable scale effects on cross weights which produces an incorrect description of the channel correlation structure. In this paper, we tackle these drawbacks and introduce a principled multi-output convolution spectral mixture kernel (MOCSM) framework. In our framework, we model channel dependencies through convolution of time and phase delayed spectral mixtures between different channels. Results of extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demontrate the advantages of MOCSM and its state of the art performance. … 

**Smart Mining for Deep Metric Learning** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
To solve deep metric learning problems and producing feature embeddings, current methodologies will commonly use a triplet model to minimise the relative distance between samples from the same class and maximise the relative distance between samples from different classes. Though successful, the training convergence of this triplet model can be compromised by the fact that the vast majority of the training samples will produce gradients with magnitudes that are close to zero. This issue has motivated the development of methods that explore the global structure of the embedding and other methods that explore hard negative/positive mining. The effectiveness of such mining methods is often associated with intractable computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning method that combines the triplet model and the global structure of the embedding space. We rely on a smart mining procedure that produces effective training samples for a low computational cost. In addition, we propose an adaptive controller that automatically adjusts the smart mining hyper-parameters and speeds up the convergence of the training process. We show empirically that our proposed method allows for fast and more accurate training of triplet ConvNets than other competing mining methods. Additionally, we show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art embedding results for CUB-200-2011 and Cars196 datasets. …
