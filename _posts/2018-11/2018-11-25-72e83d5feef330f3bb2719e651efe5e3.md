**DeepFuse** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present a novel deep learning architecture for fusing static multi-exposure images. Current multi-exposure fusion (MEF) approaches use hand-crafted features to fuse input sequence. However, the weak hand-crafted representations are not robust to varying input conditions. Moreover, they perform poorly for extreme exposure image pairs. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a method that is robust to varying input conditions and capable of handling extreme exposure without artifacts. Deep representations have known to be robust to input conditions and have shown phenomenal performance in a supervised setting. However, the stumbling block in using deep learning for MEF was the lack of sufficient training data and an oracle to provide the ground-truth for supervision. To address the above issues, we have gathered a large dataset of multi-exposure image stacks for training and to circumvent the need for ground truth images, we propose an unsupervised deep learning framework for MEF utilizing a no-reference quality metric as loss function. The proposed approach uses a novel CNN architecture trained to learn the fusion operation without reference ground truth image. The model fuses a set of common low level features extracted from each image to generate artifact-free perceptually pleasing results. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for a variety of natural images. … 

**Latent Attention Network** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Deep neural networks are able to solve tasks across a variety of domains and modalities of data. Despite many empirical successes, we lack the ability to clearly understand and interpret the learned internal mechanisms that contribute to such effective behaviors or, more critically, failure modes. In this work, we present a general method for visualizing an arbitrary neural network’s inner mechanisms and their power and limitations. Our dataset-centric method produces visualizations of how a trained network attends to components of its inputs. The computed ‘attention masks’ support improved interpretability by highlighting which input attributes are critical in determining output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a variety of deep neural network architectures in domains from computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. The primary contribution of our approach is an interpretable visualization of attention that provides unique insights into the network’s underlying decision-making process irrespective of the data modality. … 

**Deep Smoke Segmentation Network** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Inspired by the recent success of fully convolutional networks (FCN) in semantic segmentation, we propose a deep smoke segmentation network to infer high quality segmentation masks from blurry smoke images. To overcome large variations in texture, color and shape of smoke appearance, we divide the proposed network into a coarse path and a fine path. The first path is an encoder-decoder FCN with skip structures, which extracts global context information of smoke and accordingly generates a coarse segmentation mask. To retain fine spatial details of smoke, the second path is also designed as an encoder-decoder FCN with skip structures, but it is shallower than the first path network. Finally, we propose a very small network containing only add, convolution and activation layers to fuse the results of the two paths. Thus, we can easily train the proposed network end to end for simultaneous optimization of network parameters. To avoid the difficulty in manually labelling fuzzy smoke objects, we propose a method to generate synthetic smoke images. According to results of our deep segmentation method, we can easily and accurately perform smoke detection from videos. Experiments on three synthetic smoke datasets and a realistic smoke dataset show that our method achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms based on FCNs. Test results of our method on videos are also appealing. …
