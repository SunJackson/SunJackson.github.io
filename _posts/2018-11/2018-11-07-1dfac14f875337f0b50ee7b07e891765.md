“One clear conclusion of this work is that, although the DL technology has achieved very promising results, there is still a significant need for further research into and development in how to easily and efficiently build high-quality production-ready DL systems. Traditional SE has high-quality tools and practices for reviewing, writing test, and debugging code. However, they are rarely sufficient for building production-ready systems containing DL components. If the SE community, together with the DL community, could make an effort in finding solutions to these challenges, the power of the DL technology could not only be made available to researchers and large technology companies, but also to the vast majority of companies around the world.” Anders Arpteg, Björn Brinne, Luka Crnkovic-Friis, Jan Bosch ( 29 October 2018 )
