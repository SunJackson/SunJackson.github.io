**Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction**by Rich Sutton and Andrew Barto was recently released on October 15, 2018. The authors were kind enough to put a late draft version of the book online as a PDF. If you are hoping to learn about Reinforcement Learning, this is a great place to start.

Full text is available on a Google Drive at Reinforcement Learning. Take a look.

Good Luck and Happy Learning.
