This report describes support for a new type of variable-width line in the ‘vwline’ package for R that is based on Bezier curves. There is also a new function for specifying the width of a variable-width line based on Bezier curves and there is a new linejoin and lineend style, called “extend”, that is available when both the line and the width of the line are based on Bezier curves. This report also introduces a small ‘gridBezier’ package for drawing Bezier curves in R.
