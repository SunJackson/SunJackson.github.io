**Critical Line Algorithm (CLA)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The critical line method developed by the Nobel Prize winner H. Markowitz is a classical technique for the construction of a minimum-variance frontier within the paradigm of ‘the expected return-risk’ (mean-variance) and finding minimum portfolios. Considerable interest has recently been attracted to the development of a fast algorithm for the construction of the minimum-variance frontier. In some works, such algorithms have been used to find statistically stable optimal portfoli.o![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

Deequ’s purpose is to ‘unit-test’ data to find errors early, before the data gets fed to consuming systems or machine learning algorithms. In the following, we will walk you through a toy example to showcase the most basic usage of our library. An executable version of the example is available here. Deequ works on tabular data, e.g., CSV files, database tables, logs, flattened json files, basically anything that you can fit into a Spark dataframe. For this example, we assume that we work on some kind of Item data, where every item has an id, a name, a description, a priority and a count of how often it has been viewed. … 

**TextSnake** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Driven by deep neural networks and large scale datasets, scene text detection methods have progressed substantially over the past years, continuously refreshing the performance records on various standard benchmarks. However, limited by the representations (axis-aligned rectangles, rotated rectangles or quadrangles) adopted to describe text, existing methods may fall short when dealing with much more free-form text instances, such as curved text, which are actually very common in real-world scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose a more flexible representation for scene text, termed as TextSnake, which is able to effectively represent text instances in horizontal, oriented and curved forms. In TextSnake, a text instance is described as a sequence of ordered, overlapping disks centered at symmetric axes, each of which is associated with potentially variable radius and orientation. Such geometry attributes are estimated via a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model. In experiments, the text detector based on TextSnake achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, the two newly published benchmarks with special emphasis on curved text in natural images, as well as the widely-used datasets ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500. Specifically, TextSnake outperforms the baseline on Total-Text by more than 40% in F-measure. …
