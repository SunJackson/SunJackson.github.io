Fog computing serves as a computing layer that sits between the edge devices and the cloud in the network topology. They have more compute capacity than the edge but much less so than cloud data centers. They typically have high uptime and always-on Internet connectivity. Applications that make use of the fog can avoid the network performance limitation of cloud computing while being less resource constrained than edge computing. As a result, they offer a useful balance of the current paradigms. This article explores various aspects of fog computing in the context of big data. Big Data and Fog Computing
