Teaching R is our mission at **Business Science University** because **R is the most efficient language for exploring data, performing business analysis, and applying data science to business to extract ROI for an organization**. R has an amazing ecosystem of tools that seemlessly work together, which has been termed the “tidyverse”. The “tidyverse” ecosystem can take business analysis to a new level. **Here’s the key: 99.9% of business analysts don’t know R (and its awesome power). With our learning system, you can learn R quickly, setting yourself on a career tragectory in data science.**

At Business Science, We are developing a **revolutionary new system for teaching *Business Analysis with R*** (Business Analysis with R is a new course we are developing at Business Science University). The system is revolutionary for a number of reasons (we’ll get to these in a minute). The cornerstone of our teaching process is the Data Science with R Workflow that was originally taught by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund in the the excellent book, R For Data Science. **The NEW R Cheatsheet links the documentation, cheatsheets, and key resources available for every R package in the data science with R workflow into one meta-cheatsheet that illustrates the workflow**.
