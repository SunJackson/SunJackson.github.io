A couple of weeks back I had the wonderful opportunity to open the PyDataPrague meetup – this is the second meetup I’ve opened after our PyDataLondon started back in 2014. The core organisers Ondřej Kokeš, Jakub Urban and Jan Pipek asked me to give two short talks on:

We had over 100 people in the room, many from the extant local Python meetup. Štěpán Roučka also gave a talk on SymPy with lots of lovely demos (video). The organisers were lovely – do please think on speaking out at PyDataPrague, you’ll get a lovely reception. I also got to see the wonderful architecture in Prague and even visit the local observatory where we saw the sun’s corona.
