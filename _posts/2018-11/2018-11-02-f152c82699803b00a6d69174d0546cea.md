A new release of RcppAnnoy is now on CRAN.

RcppAnnoy is the Rcpp-based R integration of the nifty Annoy library by Erik. Annoy is a small and lightweight C++ template header library for very fast approximate nearest neighbours—originally developed to drive the famous Spotify music discovery algorithm.

This release updates to a new upstream version (including a new distance measure), and includes a spiffy new vignette by Aaron Lun describing how to use who Annoy from C++ as he does in his new BioConductor package BiocNeighbours.

All changes in this version are summarized below:

> 
Changes in version 0.0.11 (2018-10-30)


Synchronized with Annoy upstream (#26, #30, #36).


Added new Hamming distance measure functionality; should be considered experimental as the functionality depends on integer values.


Travis CI use was updated to the R 3.5 PPA (#28)


New vignette about Annoy use from C++ via Rcpp (Aaron Lun in #29 addressing #19; also #32, #33)


The vignette was rewritten using pinp (#34, #35).




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a diffstat report for this release.
