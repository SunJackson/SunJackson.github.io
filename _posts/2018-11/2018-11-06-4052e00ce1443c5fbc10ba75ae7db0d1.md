This month, The Data Incubator is hosting another free webinar on data science. This time it features an interview with **Jake Porway, founder of DataKind**. Jake and DataKind are doing amazing things, so I hope you can check out the webinar.

Below are the webinar details:

> 
Abstract: With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity.


The free online webinar is:Thu, November 15, 2018 @ 5:30 PM – 6:30 PM ESTYou can register at Data Science in 30 minutes.
