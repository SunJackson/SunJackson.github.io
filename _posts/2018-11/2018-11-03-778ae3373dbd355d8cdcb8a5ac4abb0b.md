**Multiview Learning** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Multi-view learning is an emerging direction in machine learning which considers learning with multiple views to improve the generalization performance. Multi-view learning is also known as data fusion or data integration from multiple feature sets. … 

**Statistical Process Control (SPC)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Statistical process control (SPC) is a method of quality control which uses statistical methods. SPC is applied in order to monitor and control a process. Monitoring and controlling the process ensures that it operates at its full potential. At its full potential, the process can make as much conforming product as possible with a minimum (if not an elimination) of waste (rework or scrap). SPC can be applied to any process where the “conforming product” (product meeting specifications) output can be measured. Key tools used in SPC include control charts; a focus on continuous improvement; and the design of experiments. An example of a process where SPC is applied is manufacturing lines. … 

**Statistical Classification** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. An example would be assigning a given email into “spam” or “non-spam” classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). In the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e. learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance. …
