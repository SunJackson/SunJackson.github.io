The `libcurl` library (the foundational library behind the `RCurl` and `curl` packages) has switched to using OpenSSLâ€™s default ciphers since version 7.56.0 (October 4 2017). If youâ€™re a regular updater of `curl`/`httr` you should be fairly current with these cipher suites, but if youâ€™re not a keen updater or use `RCurl` for your web-content tasks, you are likely not working with a recent cipher list and may start running into trouble as the internet self-proclaimed web guardians keep their wild abandon push towards â€œHTTPS Everywhereâ€�.

Why is this important? Well, as a web consumer (via browsers) you likely havenâ€™t run into any issues when visiting SSL/TLS-enabled sites since most browsers update super-frequently and bring along modern additions to cipher suites with them. Cipher suites are one of the backbones of assurance when it comes to secure connections to servers and stronger/different ciphers are continually added to `openssl` (and other libraries). If a server (rightfully) only supports a modern, seriously secure TLS configuration, clients that do not have such support wonâ€™t be able to connect and youâ€™ll see errors such as:

```
SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure

```

You can test what a *server* supports via tools like SSL Test. Iâ€™d point to a command-line tool but there are enough R users on crippled Windows systems that itâ€™s just easier to have you point and click to see. If you *are game* to try a command-line tool then give `testssl`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 a go from an RStudio terminal (I use that suggestion specifically to be platform agnostic as I cannot assume R Windows users know how to use a sane shell). The `testssl` script has virtually no dependencies so it should â€œwork everywhereâ€�. Note that both SSL Test and `testssl`make *quite a few connections* to a site so make sure youâ€™re only using your own server(s) as test targets unless you have permission from others to use theirs (go ahead and hit mine if you like).

You can also see what your R client packages support. One *could* run:

```
library(magrittr)

read.table(
 text = system("openssl ciphers -v", intern=TRUE) %>% 
 gsub("[[:alpha:]]+=", "", .)
) %>% 
 setNames(
 c("ciphername", "protoccol_version", "key_exchange", "authentication", 
 "symmetric_encryption_method", "message_authentication_code")
 )

```

in attempt to do that via the `openssl` binary on your system, but Windows users likely wonâ€™t be able to run that (unlike every other modern OS including iOS) *and* it might not show you what your installed R client packages can handle since they may be using different libraries.

So, another platform-agnostic (but requiring a call to a web site, so some privacy leakage) is to use Howâ€™s My SSL.

```
ssl_check_url <- "https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check"

jsonlite::fromJSON(
 readLines(url(ssl_check_url), warn = FALSE)
) -> base_chk

jsonlite::fromJSON(
 RCurl::getURL(ssl_check_url)
) -> rcurl_chk

jsonlite::fromJSON(
 rawToChar(
 curl::curl_fetch_memory(ssl_check_url)$content
 )
) -> curl_chk

```

Compare the `$given_cipher_suites` for each of those to see how they compare and also take a look at `$rating`. macOS and Linux users *should* have fairly uniform results for all three. Windows users may be in for a sad awakening (I mean youâ€™re used to that on a regular basis, so itâ€™s cool). You can also configure how you communicate what you support via the `ssl_cipher_list` cURL option (capitalization is a bit different with `RCurl` but I *kinda want you to use the `curl` package* so youâ€™re on your own to translate. Note that you canâ€™t game the system and claim you can handle a cipher you donâ€™t actually have.

### FIN

You should try to stay current with the OpenSSL (or equivalent) library on your operating system and also with the `libcurl` library on your system and then the `curl`, `openssl`, and `RCurl` packages. You may have production-rules requiring lead-times for changing configs but these should be in the â€œtest when they make it to CRAN and install as-soon-as-possible-thereafterâ€� category.
