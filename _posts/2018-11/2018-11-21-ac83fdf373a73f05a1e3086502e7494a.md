**JOIN THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DEEP LEARNING SUMMIT**












|





One Summit, three tracks, 10 stages. RE•WORK’s **Deep Learning Summit** has grown year on year, from 228 attendees four years ago in January 2015 to the 900+ attendees, speakers and exhibitors expected in 2019, which is a testament, not only to the excellent and fascinating work of our speakers but also to the growth in interest and application of AI.

|
**Tejas Kulkarni,***Research Scientist,*** DeepMind****Title:** *Learning to Simulate Reality*Tejas is primarily interested in understanding how the mind works. His current research goal is to build learning algorithms that acquire grounded common-sense knowledge. Learn how DL systems are trained to explicitly reason in the space of computer programs.

**Georgia Gkioxari,***Research Scientist, ***Facebook****Title:** *Embodied Vision*The role of perception is inherently tied to action. Active perception is vital for robotics. Robots perceive in order to act and act in order to perceive. In this talk, Georgia will present Facebook's efforts to build embodied agents that solve semantic tasks in realistic 3D scenes.

|
**Adrien Gaidon,*** Machine Learning Lead,*******Toyota Research Institute****Title:***Beyond Supervised Driving*Crowd-sourced steering does not sound as appealing as automated driving. Adrien will share scientific problems that have huge implications in the research and development of long-term large-scale autonomous robots. He will also talk about the robotics system perspective, especially end-to-end vs modular design and human-robot interaction.

|
**Peter Stone,***Professor***,****The University of Texas**Peter's main research interest in AI is understanding how we can best create complete intelligent agents. He considers adaptation, interaction, and embodiment to be essential capabilities of such agents. Peter's research focuses mainly on machine learning, multiagent systems, and robotics. "The most exciting research topics are those inspired by challenging real-world problems."
