If you’ve read our previous R Tip on using sigr with linear models, you might have noticed that the `lm()` summary object does in fact carry the R-squared and F statistics, both in the printed form:

and also in the `summary()` object:

Note, though, that while the summary *reports* the model’s significance, it does not carry it as a specific `summary()` object item. `sigr::wrapFTest()` is a convenient way to extract the model’s R-squared and F statistic *and* simultaneously calculate the model significance, as is required by many scientific publications.

`sigr` is even more helpful for logistic regression, via `glm()`, which reports neither the model’s chi-squared statistic nor its significance.

To get the significance of a logistic regression model, call `wrapr::wrapChiSqTest():`

Notice that the fit summary also reports a pseudo-R-squared. You can extract the values directly off the `sigr` object, as well:

And of course you can render the `sigr` object into one of several formats (Latex, html, markdown, and ascii) for direct inclusion in a report or publication.

**Chi-Square Test** summary: *pseudo-R2*=0.21 (*χ2*(2,*N*=150)=39, *p*<1e-05).

By the way, if you are interested, we give the explicit formula for calculating the significance of a logistic regression model in *Practical Data Science with R*.
