I just saw an announcement on R Bloggers about the anytime package. It looks to be a very handy package to convert dates in pretty much any format to Date or POSIX classes, without the need to define the format – it’s guessed by an underlying C++ library.

It certainly seems to be flexible… putting in the same date in 8 different formats all yielded the same result! (FWIW, “15th October 2010” doesn’t work…)

There’s an equivalent function for times (anytime instead of anydate). Looks like working with dates and times just got easier!
