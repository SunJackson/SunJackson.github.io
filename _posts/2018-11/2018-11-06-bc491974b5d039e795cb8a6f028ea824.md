**ADEPOS: Anomaly Detection based Power Saving for Predictive Maintenance using Edge Computing**

In industry 4.0, predictive maintenance(PM) is one of the most important applications pertaining to the Internet of Things(IoT). Machine learning is used to predict the possible failure of a machine before the actual event occurs. However, the main challenges in PM are (a) lack of enough data from failing machines, and (b) paucity of power and bandwidth to transmit sensor data to cloud throughout the lifetime of the machine. Alternatively, edge computing approaches reduce data transmission and consume low energy. In this paper, we propose Anomaly Detection based Power Saving(ADEPOS) scheme using approximate computing through the lifetime of the machine. In the beginning of the machines life, low accuracy computations are used when the machine is healthy. However, on the detection of anomalies, as time progresses, the system is switched to higher accuracy modes. We show using the NASA bearing dataset that using ADEPOS, we need 8.8X less neurons on average and based on post-layout results, the resultant energy savings are 6.4 to 6.65X

**MDFS – MultiDimensional Feature Selection**

Identification of informative variables in an information system is often performed using simple one-dimensional filtering procedures that discard information about interactions between variables. Such approach may result in removing some relevant variables from consideration. Here we present an R package MDFS (MultiDimensional Feature Selection) that performs identification of informative variables taking into account synergistic interactions between multiple descriptors and the decision variable. MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information theory. Computational kernel of the package is implemented in C++. A high-performance version implemented in CUDA C is also available. The applications of MDFS are demonstrated using the well-known Madelon dataset that has synergistic variables by design. The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is shown that multidimensional analysis is more sensitive than one-dimensional tests and returns more reliable rankings of importance.

**Understanding Deep Neural Networks Using Topological Data Analysis**

Deep neural networks (DNN) are black box algorithms. They are trained using a gradient descent back propagation technique which trains weights in each layer for the sole goal of minimizing training error. Hence, the resulting weights cannot be directly explained. Using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) we can get an insight on how the neural network is thinking, specifically by analyzing the activation values of validation images as they pass through each layer.

**Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks**

The problem of session-based recommendation aims to predict users’ actions based on anonymous sessions. Previous methods on the session-based recommendation most model a session as a sequence and capture users’ preference to make recommendations. Though achieved promising results, they fail to consider the complex items transitions among all session sequences, and are insufficient to obtain accurate users’ preference in the session. To better capture the structure of the user-click sessions and take complex transitions of items into account, we propose a novel method, i.e. Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks, SR-GNN for brevity. In the proposed method, session sequences are aggregated together and modeled as graph-structure data. Based on this graph, GNN can capture complex transitions of items, which are difficult to be revealed by the conventional sequential methods. Each session is then represented as the composition of the global preference and current interests of the session using an attention network. Extensive experiments conducted on two real datasets show that SR-GNN evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods and always obtain stable performance with different connection schemes, session representations, and session lengths.

**Can automated smoothing significantly improve benchmark time series classification algorithms?**

tl;dr: no, it cannot, at least not on average on the standard archive problems. We assess whether using six smoothing algorithms (moving average, exponential smoothing, Gaussian filter, Savitzky-Golay filter, Fourier approximation and a recursive median sieve) could be automatically applied to time series classification problems as a preprocessing step to improve the performance of three benchmark classifiers (1-Nearest Neighbour with Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping distances, and Rotation Forest). We found no significant improvement over unsmoothed data even when we set the smoothing parameter through cross validation. We are not claiming smoothing has no worth. It has an important role in exploratory analysis and helps with specific classification problems where domain knowledge can be exploited. What we observe is that the automatic application does not help and that we cannot explain the improvement of other time series classification algorithms over the baseline classifiers simply as a function of the absence of smoothing.

**VizRec: A framework for secure data exploration via visual representation**

Visual representations of data (visualizations) are tools of great importance and widespread use in data analytics as they provide users visual insight to patterns in the observed data in a simple and effective way. However, since visualizations tools are applied to sample data, there is a a risk of visualizing random fluctuations in the sample rather than a true pattern in the data. This problem is even more significant when visualization is used to identify interesting patterns among many possible possibilities, or to identify an interesting deviation in a pair of observations among many possible pairs, as commonly done in visual recommendation systems. We present VizRec, a framework for improving the performance of visual recommendation systems by quantifying the statistical significance of recommended visualizations. The proposed methodology allows to control the probability of misleading visual recommendations using both classical statistical testing procedures and a novel application of the Vapnik Chervonenkis (VC) dimension method which is a fundamental concept in statistical learning theory.

**Modeling IoT-aware Business Processes – A State of the Art Report**

This research report presents an analysis of the state of the art of modeling Internet of Things (IoT)-aware business processes. IOT links the physical world to the digital world. Traditionally, we would find information about events and processes in the physical world in the digital world entered by humans and humans using this information to control the physical world. In the IoT paradigm, the physical world is equipped with sensors and actuators to create a direct link with the digital world. Business processes are used to coordinate a complex environment including multiple actors for a common goal, typically in the context of administrative work. In the past few years, we have seen research efforts on the possibilities to model IoT- aware business processes, extending process coordination to real world entities directly. This set of research efforts is relatively small when compared to the overall research effort into the IoT and much of the work is still in the early research stage. To create a basis for a bridge between IoT and BPM, the goal of this report is to collect and analyze the state of the art of existing frameworks for modeling IoT-aware business processes.

**A Method For Dynamic Ensemble Selection Based on a Filter and an Adaptive Distance to Improve the Quality of the Regions of Competence**

Dynamic classifier selection systems aim to select a group of classifiers that is most adequate for a specific query pattern. This is done by defining a region around the query pattern and analyzing the competence of the classifiers in this region. However, the regions are often surrounded by noise which can difficult the classifier selection. This fact makes the performance of most dynamic selection systems no better than static selections. In this paper, we demonstrate that the performance dynamic selection systems end up limited by the quality of the regions extracted. Thereafter, we propose a new dynamic classifier selection that improves the regions of competence in order to achieve higher recognition rates. obtained from several classification databases show the proposed method not only increase the recognition performance but also decreases the computational cost.

**Dialogue Natural Language Inference**

Consistency is a long standing issue faced by dialogue models. In this paper, we frame the consistency of dialogue agents as natural language inference (NLI) and create a new natural language inference dataset called Dialogue NLI. We propose a method which demonstrates that a model trained on Dialogue NLI can be used to improve the consistency of a dialogue model, and evaluate the method with human evaluation and with automatic metrics on a suite of evaluation sets designed to measure a dialogue model’s consistency.

**Ludometrics: Luck, and How to Measure It**

Game theory is the study of tractable games which may be used to model more complex systems. Board games, video games and sports, however, are intractable by design, so ‘ludological’ theories about these games as complex phenomena should be grounded in empiricism. A first ‘ludometric’ concern is the empirical measurement of the amount of luck in various games. We argue against a narrow view of luck which includes only factors outside any player’s control, and advocate for a holistic definition of luck as complementary to the variation in effective skill within a population of players. We introduce two metrics for luck in a game for a given population – one information theoretical, and one Bayesian, and discuss the estimation of these metrics using sparse, high-dimensional regression techniques. Finally, we apply these techniques to compare the amount of luck between various professional sports, between Chess and Go, and between two hobby board games: Race for the Galaxy and Seasons.

**Sequence Generation with Guider Network**

Sequence generation with reinforcement learning (RL) has received significant attention recently. However, a challenge with such methods is the sparse-reward problem in the RL training process, in which a scalar guiding signal is often only available after an entire sequence has been generated. This type of sparse reward tends to ignore the global structural information of a sequence, causing generation of sequences that are semantically inconsistent. In this paper, we present a model-based RL approach to overcome this issue. Specifically, we propose a novel guider network to model the sequence-generation environment, which can assist next-word prediction and provide intermediate rewards for generator optimization. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method leads to improved performance for both unconditional and conditional sequence-generation tasks.

**Comparison of Classification Algorithms Used Medical Documents Categorization**

Volume of text based documents have been increasing day by day. Medical documents are located within this growing text documents. In this study, the techniques used for text classification applied on medical documents and evaluated classification performance. Used data sets are multi class and multi labelled. Chi Square (CHI) technique was used for feature selection also SMO, NB, C4.5, RF and KNN algorithms was used for classification. The aim of this study, success of various classifiers is evaluated on multi class and multi label data sets consisting of medical documents. The first 400 features, while the most successful in the KNN classifier, feature number 400 and after the SMO has become the most successful classifier.

**Probabilistic Programming with Densities in SlicStan: Efficient, Flexible and Deterministic**

Stan is a probabilistic programming language that has been increasingly used for real-world scalable projects. However, to make practical inference possible, the language sacrifices some of its usability by adopting a block syntax, which lacks compositionality and flexible user-defined functions. Moreover, the semantics of the language has been mainly given in terms of intuition about implementation, and has not been formalised. This paper provides a formal treatment of the Stan language, and introduces the probabilistic programming language SlicStan — a compositional, self-optimising version of Stan. Our main contributions are: (1) the formalisation of a core subset of Stan through an operational density-based semantics; (2) the design and semantics of the Stan-like language SlicStan, which facilities better code reuse and abstraction through its compositional syntax, more flexible functions, and information-flow type system; and (3) a formal, semantic-preserving procedure for translating SlicStan to Stan.

**Spectral Methods from Tensor Networks**

A tensor network is a diagram that specifies a way to ‘multiply’ a collection of tensors together to produce another tensor (or matrix). Many existing algorithms for tensor problems (such as tensor decomposition and tensor PCA), although they are not presented this way, can be viewed as spectral methods on matrices built from simple tensor networks. In this work we leverage the full power of this abstraction to design new algorithms for certain continuous tensor decomposition problems. An important and challenging family of tensor problems comes from orbit recovery, a class of inference problems involving group actions (inspired by applications such as cryo-electron microscopy). Orbit recovery problems over finite groups can often be solved via standard tensor methods. However, for infinite groups, no general algorithms are known. We give a new spectral algorithm based on tensor networks for one such problem: continuous multi-reference alignment over the infinite group SO(2). Our algorithm extends to the more general heterogeneous case.

**Anomaly Detection for imbalanced datasets with Deep Generative Models**

Many important data analysis applications present with severely imbalanced datasets with respect to the target variable. A typical example is medical image analysis, where positive samples are scarce, while performance is commonly estimated against the correct detection of these positive examples. We approach this challenge by formulating the problem as anomaly detection with generative models. We train a generative model without supervision on the `negative’ (common) datapoints and use this model to estimate the likelihood of unseen data. A successful model allows us to detect the `positive’ case as low likelihood datapoints. In this position paper, we present the use of state-of-the-art deep generative models (GAN and VAE) for the estimation of a likelihood of the data. Our results show that on the one hand both GANs and VAEs are able to separate the `positive’ and `negative’ samples in the MNIST case. On the other hand, for the NLST case, neither GANs nor VAEs were able to capture the complexity of the data and discriminate anomalies at the level that this task requires. These results show that even though there are a number of successes presented in the literature for using generative models in similar applications, there remain further challenges for broad successful implementation.

**CMI: An Online Multi-objective Genetic Autoscaler for Scientific and Engineering Workflows in Cloud Infrastructures with Unreliable Virtual Machines**

Cloud Computing is becoming the leading paradigm for executing scientific and engineering workflows. The large-scale nature of the experiments they model and their variable workloads make clouds the ideal execution environment due to prompt and elastic access to huge amounts of computing resources. Autoscalers are middleware-level software components that allow scaling up and down the computing platform by acquiring or terminating virtual machines (VM) at the time that workflow’s tasks are being scheduled. In this work we propose a novel online multi-objective autoscaler for workflows denominated Cloud Multi-objective Intelligence (CMI), that aims at the minimization of makespan, monetary cost and the potential impact of errors derived from unreliable VMs. In addition, this problem is subject to monetary budget constraints. CMI is responsible for periodically solving the autoscaling problems encountered along the execution of a workflow. Simulation experiments on four well-known workflows exhibit that CMI significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art autoscaler of similar characteristics called Spot Instances Aware Autoscaling (SIAA). These results convey a solid base for deepening in the study of other meta-heuristic methods for autoscaling workflow applications using cheap but unreliable infrastructures.

**Invertible Residual Networks**

Reversible deep networks provide useful theoretical guarantees and have proven to be a powerful class of functions in many applications. Usually, they rely on analytical inverses using dimension splitting, fundamentally constraining their structure compared to common architectures. Based on recent links between ordinary differential equations and deep networks, we provide a sufficient condition when standard ResNets are invertible. This condition allows unconstrained architectures for residual blocks, while only requiring an adaption to their regularization scheme. We numerically compute their inverse, which has O(1) memory cost and computational cost of 5-20 forward passes. Finally, we show that invertible ResNets perform on par with standard ResNets on classifying MNIST and CIFAR10 images.

**Analysing Dropout and Compounding Errors in Neural Language Models**

This paper carries out an empirical analysis of various dropout techniques for language modelling, such as Bernoulli dropout, Gaussian dropout, Curriculum Dropout, Variational Dropout and Concrete Dropout. Moreover, we propose an extension of variational dropout to concrete dropout and curriculum dropout with varying schedules. We find these extensions to perform well when compared to standard dropout approaches, particularly variational curriculum dropout with a linear schedule. Largest performance increases are made when applying dropout on the decoder layer. Lastly, we analyze where most of the errors occur at test time as a post-analysis step to determine if the well-known problem of compounding errors is apparent and to what end do the proposed methods mitigate this issue for each dataset. We report results on a 2-hidden layer LSTM, GRU and Highway network with embedding dropout, dropout on the gated hidden layers and the output projection layer for each model. We report our results on Penn-TreeBank and WikiText-2 word-level language modelling datasets, where the former reduces the long-tail distribution through preprocessing and one which preserves rare words in the training and test set.

**Unsupervised Learning of Interpretable Dialog Models**

Recently several deep learning based models have been proposed for end-to-end learning of dialogs. While these models can be trained from data without the need for any additional annotations, it is hard to interpret them. On the other hand, there exist traditional state based dialog systems, where the states of the dialog are discrete and hence easy to interpret. However these states need to be handcrafted and annotated in the data. To achieve the best of both worlds, we propose Latent State Tracking Network (LSTN) using which we learn an interpretable model in unsupervised manner. The model defines a discrete latent variable at each turn of the conversation which can take a finite set of values. Since these discrete variables are not present in the training data, we use EM algorithm to train our model in unsupervised manner. In the experiments, we show that LSTN can help achieve interpretability in dialog models without much decrease in performance compared to end-to-end approaches.
