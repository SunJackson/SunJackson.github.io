The Rocker Project maintains the official Docker images of interest to R users. I use their images as a base to deploy containerized Shiny apps, but the virtual size of the images I build tends to fall in the range between 400 and 600 MB. To reduce the size of my images, I decided to try building a Shiny Server on Alpine Linux as an alternative to Rocker’s Debian-based images. In this series of articles, I’ll document my progress from building a base image with R to building an image with Shiny Server. The Dockerfiles included in this article can be found at the velaco/alpine-r repository.



## About Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a lightweight distribution that is popular for deploying containerized apps because the virtual size of an Alpine Docker image starts at 5 MB. The virtual size of images based on other distributions exceeds 100 MB before adding anything else to them, so Alpine achieves a significant reduction in size.

Some key differences between Alpine and other distributions that are relevant to my project are:

- Alpine uses *musl lib* as a lightweight alternative to *glibc*. That means precompiled installers built on platforms with *glibc* could be useless, even if I install *libc6-compat* or *glibc* packages for Alpine Linux.

- Alpine drops old versions of packages when new versions become available, making version pinning impossible, so I probably won’t be able to use nodejs and npm packages from the official repositories to build Shiny Server.


Because of those characteristics, I assume that building the images will require compiling most key dependencies from source. I’ve never done that before, so working on this project will be a great (and painful) learning experience.

## Build from Native Packages

Building from source can often take up a lot of time, so I decided to start with the native packages to build a working image as soon as possible. Here is what my Dockerfile looked like:

```
FROM alpine:3.8

MAINTAINER Aleksandar Ratesic "[email protected]"

# Declare environment variables ------------------

ENV LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8

ENV BUILD_DEPS \
 cairo-dev \ 
 libxmu-dev \
 openjdk8-jre-base \ 
 pango-dev \
 perl \
 tiff-dev \
 tk-dev

ENV PERSISTENT_DEPS \
 R-mathlib \
 gcc \
 gfortran \
 icu-dev \
 libjpeg-turbo \
 libpng-dev \
 make \
 openblas-dev \
 pcre-dev \
 readline-dev \
 xz-dev \
 zlib-dev \
 bzip2-dev \
 curl-dev

# Install R and R-dev ------------------

RUN apk upgrade --update && \
 apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps $BUILD_DEPS && \
 apk add --no-cache --virtual .persistent-deps $PERSISTENT_DEPS && \
 apk add --no-cache R R-dev && \
 apk del .build-deps

CMD ["R", "--no-save"]

```

The resulting image has a virtual size of 136.4 MB. That’s an improvement in size compared to the rocker/r-base image, which is 277.4MB according to MicroBadger. However, I should mention that the rocker/r-base image includes some packages like *litter* that my Dockerfile doesn’t, so it has additional features that could be of interest to R users. (Not to mention that it is also more stable for use in production than my image.)

## Build from Source Code

I recently learned that Alpine drops old versions of packages from the repository when new versions become available ( Source ). That means some versions of R won’t always be available from the official repositories, so I decided to create a Dockerfile for building R from source as well. I made the following changes to the previous Dockerfile:

- Declared environment variables for storing the R version and target directory for the source code.

- Added *wget* and *tar* to build dependencies for getting and unpacking the sources.

- Added *libint* and *g++* to runtime dependencies. I learned that *g++* is necessary for building from source after the first attempt raised an error while setting up the configuration options. The first container I started failed to run R because package *libint* was not installed, so I added it later.

- Removed the *R-mathlib* package from runtime dependencies. Rmath is installed as a standalone library from source in this image.

- Finally, I changed the RUN command accordingly to get, configure, and install R from source instead of adding the native packages.


This is what the final version of the file looked like:

```
FROM alpine:3.8

ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8

ENV R_VERSION 3.5.1
ENV R_SOURCE /usr/local/src/R

RUN apk upgrade --update && \
 apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps $BUILD_DEPS && \
 apk add --no-cache --virtual .persistent-deps $PERSISTENT_DEPS && \
 mkdir -p $R_SOURCE && cd $R_SOURCE && \
 wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz && \
 tar -zxvf R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz && \
 cd R-${R_VERSION} && \
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
 --without-x && \
 make && make install && \
 cd src/nmath/standalone && make && make install && \
 apk del .build-deps

CMD ["R"]

```

The virtual size of the image it built was 311.6 MB, but it should be possible to reduce the image even further by cleaning up after building R. I didn’t want to do that yet because I still had to run the container and perform `make check` from the shell to test the installation.

There was one non-fatal error (raised by `shownNonASCIIfile()`) and two fatal errors raised by timezone.R and reg-tests-1c.R tests:

```

```

According to the R Installation and Administration manual:

> 
Failures are not necessarily problems as they might be caused by missing functionality, but you should look carefully at any reported discrepancies. (Some non-fatal errors are expected in locales that do not support Latin-1, in particular in true C locales and non-UTF-8 non-Western-European locales.)


Although the container runs R and has passed most tests, I wouldn’t feel confident using it in production or as a base for building Shiny Server because of the fatal errors. Therefore, this Dockerfile in the staging branch of my repository for now until those issues are fixed.

## Next Steps

In R’s APKBUILD file I found the line

`# TODO: Run provided test suite.`

Because the R version installed from native packages was not tested, I have no reason to assume that is more reliable than my build from source. I am tempted to build Shiny Server on Alpine as soon as possible, and I will definitely make an attempt at building that image just to get an overview of the process. However, while I explore the process of building Shiny from Source, I will also focus on resolving the issues raised by the tests to create a reliable base image for Shiny.
