R is designed to make working with statistical models fast, succinct, and reliable.

For instance building a model is a one-liner:

And producing a detailed diagnostic summary of the model is also a one-liner:

However, useful as the above is: it isn’t exactly presentation ready. To formally report the R-squared of our model we would have to cut and paste this information from the summary. That is a needlessly laborious and possibly error-prone step.

With the `sigr` package this can be made much easier:

And this formal summary can be directly rendered into many formats (Latex, html, markdown, and ascii).

**F Test** summary: (*R2*=0.76, *F*(1,148)=468.6, *p*<1e-05).

`sigr` can help make your publication workflow much easier and more repeatable/reliable.
