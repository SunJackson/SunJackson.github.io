Despite their now inherent evil status, GitHub has some tools other repository aggregators do not. One such tool is the free vulnerability alert service which will scan repositories for outdated+vulnerable dependencies.

Now, â€œRâ€� is nowhere near a first-class citizen in the internet writ large, including software development tooling (e.g. the Travis-CI and GitLab continuous integration recipes are *community* maintained vs a first-class/supported offering). This also means that GitHubâ€™s service will never check for nor alert when a pure R package has security issues, mostly due to the fact that thereâ€™s only a teensy few of us who even bother to check packages for issues once in a while and thereâ€™s no real way to report said issues into the CVE process easily (though I *guess* I could given that my $DAYJOB is an official CVE issuer), so the integrity & safety of the R package ecosystem is still in the *â€œtrust me, everythingâ€™s ![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f44d.png?w=456&ssl=1)

!!â€�* state. Given that, any extra way to keep even *some* R packages less insecure is great.

So, right now youâ€™re thinking *â€œyou click-baited us with a title that your lede just said isnâ€™t possibleâ€¦WTHeck?!*.

Itâ€™s true that GitHub does not consider R a first-class citizen, *but* it does support Java and:

```
 available.packages() %>% 
 dplyr::as_data_frame() %>% 
 tidyr::separate_rows(Imports, sep=",[[:space:]]*") %>% # we really just
 tidyr::separate_rows(Depends, sep=",[[:space:]]*") %>% # need these two
 tidyr::separate_rows(Suggests, sep=",[[:space:]]*") %>%
 tidyr::separate_rows(Enhances, sep=",[[:space:]]*") %>%
 dplyr::select(Package, Imports, Depends) %>% 
 filter(
 grepl("rJava", Imports) | grepl("rJava", "Depends") | 
 grepl("Suggests", Imports) | grepl("Enhances", "Depends")
 ) %>% 
 dplyr::distinct(Package) %>% 
 dplyr::summarise(total_pkgs_using_rjava = n())
 ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
 ## total_pkgs_using_rjava
 ## 
 ## 1 66

```

according to ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/261d.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/261d.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 there are 66 CRAN packages that require `rJava`, seven of which explicitly provide only JARs (a compressed directory tree of supporting Java classes). There are more CRAN-unpublished `rJava`-based projects on GitLab & GitHub, but itâ€™s likely that public-facing `rJava` packages that include or depend on public JAR-dependent projects still number less than ~200. Given the now >13K packages in CRAN, this is a tiny subset but with the sorry state of R security, anything is better than nothing.

Having said that, one big reason (IMO) for the lack of Java-wrapped CRAN or â€œdevtoolsâ€�-only released `rJava`-dependent packages it that itâ€™s 2018 and you still have better odds of winning a Vegas-jackpot than you do getting `rJava` to work on your workstation in less than 4 tries and especially after an OS upgrade. Thatâ€™s *sad* since there are many wonderful, solid and useful Java libraries that would be super-handy for many workflows yet most of us (Iâ€™m including myself) package-writers prefer to spin wheels to get C++ or Rust libraries working with R than try to make it easier for regular R users to tap into that rich Java ecosystem.

But, I digress.

For the handful of us that do write and use `rJava`-based packages, we can better serve our userbase by deliberately putting those R+Java repos on GitHub. Now, I hear you. Theyâ€™re evil and by doing this one of the most evil corporations on the planet can make money with your metadata (and, possibly just blatantly steal your code for use in-product without credit) but Iâ€™ll give that up on a case-by-case basis to make it easier to keep users safe.

Why will this enhance safety? Go take a look at one of my non-CRAN `rJava`-backed packages: `pdfbox`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
. It has this *awesome* â€œin-your-faceâ€� security warning banner:

The vulnerability is CVE-2018-11797 which is baseline computed to be â€œhigh severityâ€� with a the following specific weakness: *In Apache PDFBox 1.8.0 to 1.8.15 and 2.0.0RC1 to 2.0.11, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an extremely long running computation when parsing the page tree.*. So, itâ€™s a process denial of service vulnerability. Youâ€™ll also note I havenâ€™t updated the JARs yet (mostly since itâ€™s not a code-execution vulnerability).

I knew about this 28 days ago (Iâ€™ve been incredibly busy and thereâ€™s alot of blather required to talk about it, hence the delay in blogging) thanks to the GitHub service and will resolve it when I get some free time over the Thanksgiving break. I received an alert for this, there are hooks for security alerts (so one can auto-create an issue) and thereâ€™s a warning for users and any of them could file an issue to let me know itâ€™s super-important to them that I get it fixed (or they could be super-awesome and file a PR :-).

### FIN

The TLDR is (first) a note â€” to package authors â€” who use `rJava` to bite the GitHub bullet and take advantage of this free service; and, (second) â€” to users â€” to encourage use of this service by authors of packages you use and to keep a watchful eye out for any security alerts for code you depend on to get things done.

A (perhaps) third and final note is for all of us to be to continually mindful about the safety & integrity of the R package ecosystem and do what we can to keep moving it forward.
