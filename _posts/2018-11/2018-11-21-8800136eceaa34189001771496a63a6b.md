The algorithm selection problem is to choose the most suitable algorithm for solving a given problem instance and thus, it leverages the complementarity between different approaches that is present in many areas of AI. We report on the state of the art in algorithm selection, as defined by the Algorithm Selection Competition series 2015 to 2017. The results of these competitions show how the state of the art improved over the years. Although performance in some cases is very promising, there is still room for improvement in other cases. Finally, we provide insights into why some scenarios are hard, and pose challenges to the community on how to advance the current state of the art.
