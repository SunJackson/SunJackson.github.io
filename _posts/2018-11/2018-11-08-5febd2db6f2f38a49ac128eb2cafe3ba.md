As I've said here before, I like reading my mail with 
mutt; 
it's true that it sucks less. For a while I've kept a local 
abook file with my contacts; or a least a 
partial list of people I normally send e-mails to. It was synchronized across 
several computers using Dropbox and more or less did the job, but lately I've 
tried to centralize this using Fastmail's servers. 
I've used this pretty handy Perl script to 
query Fastmail's LDAP servers, but this takes a second for every contact I want 
to e-mail. Not a lot of time, but not optimal either. Also, I don't have a local 
copy of my entire address book.

The other day I came across a pretty nice solution that doesn't involve coding 
almost anything on our end. It turns out that Fastmail offers an HTTP entry 
point for the entire address 
book as a 
single vcard file in the following URL:

This, combined with the fact that abook is able to convert between vcard and its 
own native format, gives us this script:

Where, obviously, `$PASS` is whatever application password we have for this. And 
then we only have to set up a cron job to run this script from time to time tell 
mutt to use abook to locate addresses, as always:
