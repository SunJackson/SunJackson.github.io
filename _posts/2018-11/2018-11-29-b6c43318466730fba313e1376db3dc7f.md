Python has become a required skill for data science, and it’s easy to see why! It’s powerful, easy to learn, and includes the libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit that help you slice, scrub, munge, and wrangle your data. For someone just starting though, where do you begin? With a good guide to show you the way, the possibilities are yours!

In this free eBook, a hand-picked collection of chapters from three Manning books by **Naomi Ceder**, founder of the Python Education Summit, you'll get started by:

- Building your foundation in data science processes with practical Python tips and techniques

- Understanding the data science process inside and out

- Practicing using Python for processing, cleaning, and exploring interesting datasets
