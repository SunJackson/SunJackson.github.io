The Department of Leadership, Policy, and Organizations (LPO) of Peabody College, Vanderbilt University, seeks a faculty member in the area of Data and Analytics.  This appointment is for a non-tenure track position as Senior Lecturer. The position is for an initial 3-year contract with the possibility of renewal.

The Senior Lecturer should have a strong background in the area of data science and analytics. The role for this senior lecturer position is primarily instructional; therefore, evidence of success in teaching undergraduate, masters, and professional doctoral-level or MBA students is critical.

Primary teaching responsibilities will include courses in the broad area of quantitative methods, including data science, strategy and analytics, and applied statistics. Other opportunities include supervising capstone projects in the professional doctorate program. The position can also be affiliated with Vanderbilt’s Data Science Institute.

Candidates for the Senior Lecturer position must have an earned doctorate in a field of relevance to the study of data and analytics (such as quantitative methods, data science and mining, and analytics), but may come from many different disciplines, including education, business, statistics or other fields. Though housed within the Peabody College of Education and Human Development, our programs serve students in many fields; thus, the position provides opportunities to engage with professional students from varied industries and settings.
