](http://myinspirationinformation.com/visualisation/d3-js/spotify-related-artists-app)A while back I created an R package to pull data out of the Spotify API and turn it into a d3.js visualisation. Here is the [blogpost](http://myinspirationinformation.com/visualisation/d3-js/spotify-related-artists-visualisation). I’ve started to teach myself Python and I’ve now re-built this process with it. The exciting part is, as it’s in Python I can use the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) to create an app that hosts the code online. That means anyone can generate a related artists visualisation. Hurray! Have a go yourself by following [this link](http://spotify-related-artists-1.appspot.com/)

To find out more about how its done read on…I learnt some basic Python using [code academy](http://www.codecademy.com/). Then taking some lessons from when I built this in R, I decided rather than mess about with the data in data frames, the important bit is to create the json for the data. So this time I just iterate through the results adding them to my json string. It’s much quicker now. I used the [urllib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html) package to pull in from the API and [json](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) package to convert into the json data form.

I already knew about the google app engine after reading this [blogpost](http://www.coppelia.io/2014/08/a-new-home-for-pifreak). Next I went through their online [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction). It explains how to use [webapp2](https://webapp-improved.appspot.com/) to make your process work as a web page. Then the Handling Forms section explains about requesting data using; RequestHandler with the *get* option, and then pushing back out the results with the RequestHandler *post* option.

That’s it really. To try out the app [click here](http://spotify-related-artists-1.appspot.com/)
