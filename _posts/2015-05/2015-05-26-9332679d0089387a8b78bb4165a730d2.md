Below is the trend of six sigma search over the period from google trends.

There can be two reasons for the decreasing trend:

1. The awareness on six sigma has almost done, hence the search is reduced over the period.

1. Six sigma is not really a big deal.


May be I go with the second one but the reason is slightly different,

So many people are getting trained on six sigma just paying money ( 2 days, 5 days and max 10 days), then they start practice and teach six sigma.

I know personally so many inefficient people teaching six sigma!

So what they teach is six sigma now. I think this is the reason behind the fade out of six sigma.
