TL;DR: I've implemented a logistic ordinal regression or
 proportional odds model. [Here is the Python code](http://github.com/fabianp/minirank/blob/master/minirank/logistic.py)

The *logistic ordinal regression* model, also known as the
proportional odds was introduced in the early 80s by McCullagh [, ]
and is a generalized linear model specially tailored for the case of
predicting ordinal variables, that is, variables that are discrete (as
in classification) but which can be ordered (as in regression). It can
be seen as an extension of the logistic regression model to the
ordinal setting. 

Given $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ input data and $y \in
\mathbb{N}^n$ target values. For simplicity we assume $y$ is a
non-decreasing vector, that is, $y_1 \leq y_2 \leq ...$. Just as the
logistic regression models posterior probability $P(y=j|X_i)$ as the
logistic function, in the logistic ordinal regression we model the
*cummulative* probability as the logistic function. That is,

$$
P(y \leq j|X_i) = \phi(\theta_j - w^T X_i) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(w^T X_i - \theta_j)}
$$

where $w, \theta$ are vectors to be estimated from the data and $\phi$
is the logistic function defined as $\phi(t) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-t))$.

Compared to multiclass logistic regression, we have added the
constrain that the hyperplanes that separate the different classes are
*parallel* for all classes, that is, the vector $w$ is common across
classes. To decide to which class will $X_i$ be predicted we make use
of the vector of thresholds $\theta$. If there are $K$ different
classes, $\theta$ is a non-decreasing vector (that is, $\theta_1 \leq
\theta_2 \leq ... \leq \theta_{K-1}$) of size $K-1$. We will then
assign the class $j$ if the prediction $w^T X$ (recall that it's a
linear model) lies in the interval $[\theta_{j-1}, \theta_{j}[$. In
order to keep the same definition for extremal classes, we define
$\theta_{0} = - \infty$ and $\theta_K = + \infty$.

The intuition is that we are seeking a vector $w$ such that $X w$
produces a set of values that are well separated into the different
classes by the different thresholds $\theta$. We choose a logistic
function to model the probability $P(y \leq j|X_i)$ but other choices
are possible. In the proportional hazards model the probability
is modeled as $-\log(1 - P(y \leq j | X_i)) = \exp(\theta_j - w^T
X_i)$. Other link functions are possible, where the link function
satisfies $\text{link}(P(y \leq j | X_i)) = \theta_j - w^T X_i$. Under
this framework, the logistic ordinal regression model has a logistic
link function and the proportional hazards model has a log-log link
function.

The logistic ordinal regression model is also known as the
proportional odds model, because the
[ratio of corresponding odds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio)
for two different samples $X_1$ and $X_2$ is $\exp(w^T(X_1 - X_2))$ and
so does not depend on the class $j$ but only on the difference between
the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$.

### Optimization

Model estimation can be posed as an optimization problem. Here, we
minimize the loss function for the model, defined as minus the
log-likelihood:

$$
\mathcal{L}(w, \theta) = - \sum_{i=1}^n \log(\phi(\theta_{y_i} - w^T X_i) - \phi(\theta_{y_i -1} - w^T X_i))
$$

In this sum all terms are convex on $w$, thus the loss function is
convex over $w$. It might be also jointly convex over $w$ and
$\theta$, although I haven't checked. I use the function
`fmin_slsqp` in `scipy.optimize` to optimize
$\mathcal{L}$ under the constraint that $\theta$ is a non-decreasing
vector. There might be better options, I don't know. If you do know,
please leave a comment!.

Using the formula $\log(\phi(t))^\prime = (1 - \phi(t))$, we can compute the gradient of the loss function as 

$\begin{align}
\nabla_w \mathcal{L}(w, \theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n X_i (1 - \phi(\theta_{y_i} - w^T X_i) - \phi(\theta_{y_i-1} - w^T X_i)) \\
% \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(w, \theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{e_{y_i} \exp(\theta_{y_i}) - e_{y_i -1} \exp(\theta_{y_i -1})}{\exp(\theta_{y_i}) - \exp(\theta_{y_i-1})} \\
\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(w, \theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n e_{y_i} \left(1 - \phi(\theta_{y_i} - w^T X_i) - \frac{1}{1 - \exp(\theta_{y_i -1} - \theta_{y_i})}\right) \\
 & \qquad + e_{y_i -1}\left(1 - \phi(\theta_{y_i -1} - w^T X_i) - \frac{1}{1 - \exp(- (\theta_{y_i-1} - \theta_{y_i}))}\right)
\end{align}$

where $e_i$ is the $i$th canonical vector.

### Code

I've implemented a Python version of this algorithm using Scipy's
`optimize.fmin_slsqp` function. This takes as arguments the
loss function, the gradient denoted before and a function that is
> 0 when the inequalities on $\theta$ are satisfied.

Code
can be found here as part of the [minirank](https://github.com/fabianp/minirank) package, which
is my sandbox for code related to ranking and ordinal regression. At
some point I would like to submit it to scikit-learn but right now the
I don't know how the code will scale to medium-scale problems, but I
suspect not great. On top of that I'm not sure if there is a real demand
of these models for scikit-learn and I don't want to bloat the package
with unused features.

### Performance

I compared the prediction accuracy of this model in the sense of mean absolute
error (IPython
notebook) on the boston
house-prices dataset. To have an ordinal variable, I
rounded the values to the closest integer, which gave me a problem of
size 506 $\times$ 13 with 46 different target values. Although not a
huge increase in accuracy, this model did give me better results on
this particular dataset:

Here, ordinal logistic regression is the best-performing model,
followed by a Linear Regression model and a One-versus-All Logistic
regression model as implemented in scikit-learn.
