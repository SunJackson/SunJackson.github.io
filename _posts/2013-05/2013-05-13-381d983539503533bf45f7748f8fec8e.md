I've spent a lot of time on this blog working with matplotlib animations
(see the basic tutorial
[here](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial),
as well as my examples of animating
[a quantum system](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python),
[an optical illusion](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/09/26/optical-illusions-in-matplotlib),
[the Lorenz system in 3D](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/02/16/animating-the-lorentz-system-in-3d),
and [recreating Super Mario](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/01/13/hacking-super-mario-bros-with-python)).
Up until now, I've not have not combined the animations with IPython notebooks.
The problem is that so far the integration of IPython with matplotlib is
entirely static, while animations are by their nature dynamic. There are some
efforts in the IPython and matplotlib development communities to remedy this,
but it's still not an ideal setup.

I had an idea the other day about how one might get around this limitation
in the case of animations. By creating a function which saves an animation
and embeds the binary data into an HTML string, you can fairly easily create
automatically-embedded animations within a notebook.
