How low can you go?

At the time of writing (April 2014), the lowest score obtained on a game of televised Jeopardy! is **-$5,100** (I’m sure someone on the internet will correct me if I am wrong).

That might sound bad, but what is the lowest (theoretical) score it is possible to obtain on the game?

Paradoxically, to achieve this minimum score would take a fair amount of skill. You’d need to have lightning reflexes to be able to buzz-in to answer the question before anyone else. You’d then have to make sure the answer you gave couldn’t possibly be correct (Or I guess you could simple say nothing at all and time out each time).

## Minimum Jeopardy!

To get the very lowest possible score, we have to hope that each of the **Daily Double** squares lives under the lowest possible score on the board. Landing on the daily double allows a player to wager any (positive) amount up to his current score *or* the value of the highest question on the board. This latter part is crucial to maximizing our loss as it turns a ‘vanilla’ **$200** cell on the first round into another **$1,000** question.

In *Double Jeopardy!*, the *Daily Doubles* can turn two **$400** squares into two additional **$2,000** questions.

## Putting it all together

The worst score is achieved by hitting the *Daily Double* on the first round, betting the maximum possible **$1,000**, getting it wrong, then answering all the other questions wrong. Your score at the end of the first round would be:


5 × ($200 + $400 + $600 + $800 + $1,000) +

At the end of the first round you'd have lost an impressive **$18,800**

In *Double Jeopardy*, you could lose an additional **$39,200**


4 × ($400 + $800 + $1,200 + $1,600 + $2,000) +
|-$58,000||The grand total would be a loss of **$58,000**. Sadly, since you'd finish *Double Jeopardy* with a negative score you are not eligible to enter *Final Jeopardy* so your losing ends here!|
