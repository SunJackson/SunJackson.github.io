**Some facts:** In the USA, 28% of all energy consumed is used for transportation. Of this transportation energy, 93% comes from petroleum. Cars and light trucks account for 59% of US transportation use, with the average fuel consumption of cars in the USA being around *23 mpg*.

US transportation petroleum use is currently at 161% of the total US production of petroleum, so much is imported.


### The misrepresentation of fuel consumption by quoting fuel efficiency
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/april12014/car.png)|Traditionally, fuel consumption figures for vehicles are quoted as *miles achievable per gallon* or **MPG**. This term is so commonly used and present in our vernacular that it seems so obvious and natural a measurement.MPG, however, is more accurately a measure of *fuel efficiency.*|

MPG, however, is more accurately a measure of *fuel efficiency.*
|Fuel efficiency is not the most appropriate or intuitive method for measuring fuel consumption. I’ll give some examples later, but the fundamental reason is that we’re trying to measure consumption, and when measuring miles *per* gallon, the consumption term is on the denominator and so this results in a reciprocal proportional representation. The human mind is much better at dealing with linear relationships (especially when dealing with comparison situations).|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/april12014/gg.png)|
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/april12014/gp.png)|It might sound like a small difference, but a much more appropriate/understandable measure for fuel consumption should be *gallons per mile*.This inverse is the way things are measured in other countries in the World. Where the metric system is common place, fuel consumption is typically measured by **L/100 Km** (Litres per 100 Km).Litres per *100* Km is used instead of Litres per Km, just to make the numbers a little more manageable with less decimals.|

This inverse is the way things are measured in other countries in the World. Where the metric system is common place, fuel consumption is typically measured by **L/100 Km** (Litres per 100 Km).

*Fuel consumption* is a better measure of a vehicles performance because it is a linear relationship with the fuel used, as opposed to *fuel economy* which has an inherent reciprocal distortion.

Ask yourself the question, would you rather know how far you could travel on a gallon of gas, or how much gas you are going to use on your trip?

### Gallons per Mile

The graph below shows the relationship between MPG and the number of gallons needed to drive 1,000 miles. The reciprocal relationship is clearly visible. (I've used 1,000 miles, just to make the numbers bigger and less decimals. It's also a good estimate to the number of miles that average person will drive in a month).

- If your car does 20 MPG, then to travel 1,000 miles you will need 50 gallons of fuel.

- If your car does 25 MPG, then to travel 1,000 miles you will need 40 gallons of fuel.

- If your car does 100 MPG, then to travel 1,000 miles you will need 10 gallons of fuel.

Because of this non-linear relationship, equal increases in MPG improvements do not equate to equal improvements in gas savings.

A *5 mpg* improvement in fuel efficiency of a vehicle from *10 mpg* to *15 mpg* results in a savings of 33.33 gallons over the course of 1,000 miles. Quite an improvement. Especially now that gas is close to $4.00/gallon.

A *5 mpg* improvement for a vehicle that already does *30 mpg* results in a much smaller savings of just 4.76 gallons over the same 1,000 miles.

Let's be clear, a car with a higher fuel efficiency (higher mpg), will *always* use less fuel than one with a lower fuel efficiency; you should always go for the most fuel efficient car you can, but what I am showing is that similar linear increases in mpg efficiency make different improvements in fuel savings.

The more fuel inefficient a vehicle is, the bigger the improvement in fuel savings will be for a small improvement in efficiency. Replacing a car with a fuel efficiency of *10 mpg* with one with a fuel efficiency of *11 mpg* will save more fuel than replacing a car with a rate of *30 mpg* with one with a rate of *41 mpg*!

If your family *really* needs a huge full-size monster of a vehicle, exchanging it with even a slightly more efficient equivalent monster (possibly a hybrid?) could make a substantial difference to your monthly fuel costs. Conversely, changing an already highly efficient car into a hyper efficient car is not going to make a big change in your monthly fuel bills, even with a, potentially, large step up in efficiency.

### Family cars
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/april12014/gg2.png)|This non-linear relationship also means that averages are harder to comprehend. For example, if a family has two cars; an SUV rated *16 mpg* and a compact car rated *35 mpg*, if both cars are driven the same distance each year, less fuel would be used by the family if they replaced both cars with a pair of cars rated *22 mpg* each!If fuel consumption rates were measured in *gallons per mile*, comparisons and improvements would be much easier to comprehend, and could be simply added an subtracted.|

If fuel consumption rates were measured in *gallons per mile*, comparisons and improvements would be much easier to comprehend, and could be simply added an subtracted.

- An SUV with an efficiency of *16 mpg* consumes 62.50 gallons per 1,000 miles.

- A compact car with an efficiency of *35 mpg* consumes 28.57 gallons per 1,000 miles.

- Total for both cars is 62.50 + 28.57 = 91.07 gallons per 1,000 miles.

- 91.07 ÷ 2 = 45.54 gallons per 1,000 miles (per car).

- A car with efficiency of *22 mpg* has a consumption of 45.45 gallons per 1,000 miles (which is less).


### How much does that extra speed cost you?
