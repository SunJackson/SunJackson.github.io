A couple of days ago, President Obama gave his **2012 State of the Union Address**. I listened with interest.
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/seal.jpg)|A couple of days ago, President Obama gave his **2012 State of the Union Address**. I listened with interest.As I was listening to the speech, I became curious about the words he used, and how his speech compared to the past speeches and past Presidents. This blog article contains my analysis.Before I get going, I want to state, for the record, that this article is not meant as any form of political comment for either party. My personal politics are my opinion, and comments here are comments based purely on the analysis of the speeches. My comments do not represent any hidden agenda or reporting bias – the data speak for themselves.|

Before I get going, I want to state, for the record, that this article is not meant as any form of political comment for either party. My personal politics are my opinion, and comments here are comments based purely on the analysis of the speeches. My comments do not represent any hidden agenda or reporting bias – the data speak for themselves.

This analysis is interesting on a couple of levels: both as a window into the various Presidents and what/how they deliver their messages, and also as a view over history and how memes and issues have changed over time.

Just how often did each President mention the word *"God"* or *"War"* or *"America"* in their addresses? How did the frequency of use of these words change over time? Read more to find out …

### Methodology
|First I obtained the transcripts of past speeches. I elected to go back to **1934**, the start of **President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s** office. Then I selected a couple of hundred words that I wanted to track. I counted the occurrence of each distinct word in the speeches, then, because each speech was a different length, I normalized the count to show the average frequency of each word *per thousand* words of speech.|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/bubble.jpg)|

### Canonical Forms
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/bal.jpg)|Certain words are related, or are canonical forms, or plurals, and so for some keywords there is more than one string that I will count as a *hit*. For instance I group the words *Iran* and *Iranian* in one category, and *worker* and *workers* as one category.Finally, the search is case insensitive, and punctuation insensitive. (All the words you will see in my report are represented entirely in **lower case**, even the proper nouns. Rest assured, they were counted correctly).|

Finally, the search is case insensitive, and punctuation insensitive. (All the words you will see in my report are represented entirely in **lower case**, even the proper nouns. Rest assured, they were counted correctly).

### The Results

Below are the results, and a few comments on the findings. In the interests of space, the tabular data in this web page only shows the most recent 25 years. The charts, being more compact, when I have included them, show the full 82 speeches analyzed. In this editorialized page, I have not included charts for every word. If you want the complete data, you can find all the [tabular data here](table.html) and [all the charts](charts.html) here (without my annotations). [WARNING – these pages are large and may take a few seconds to download and render!]

On the charts, the x-axis shows the year, and the y-axis depicts the frequency of use of that keyword in the speech, normalized by the length of each speech and represented as the frequency per 1,000 spoken words.

NOTE – Certain years *e.g.* 1981 have two entries; one for the outgoing President (in this example **President Carter**), and one for the incoming President (in this example **President Reagan**). Light shading of the chart background is used to depict Democrat and Repuplican parties.

I've broken the words down into a few (vaguely) related categories, let's look at a few in turn …

### Personal Pronouns

The first category, contains (mainly) personal pronouns. I wanted to know if the different Presidents used *"we"* and *"our"* refering the nation including himself, or *"I"* reference just himself, to varying degrees. These are very common words, peaking at over a couple of dozen uses per thousand words.

In the tables below, the shading represents the intensity of use by that President (lighter depicts a higher use. I used a log scale to get best use of the available color palette range). Color represents political party, and each grid gives the frequency per 1,000 words to one decimal place accuracy. (As stated above, the tables show the most recent 25 years of data, though the chart show 78 years. the complete set of tabular data is [available here](charts.html)).

In recent years, it appears that Obama uses the word *I* in his speeches almost twice as much as Bush before him, and before that, Clinton used it even more frequently. (Ford and Jonhnson also were a little higher than average).

Everyone appears to use *We* in similary amounts. (With the possible exception of Eissenhower).
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/002.png)


*Our* is similarly flat …
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/003.png)


… but starting in the Reagan era, *you* started to become more common.

Cliton, and the senior Bush talked about *change* a little more than other recent Presidents.

Eissenhower and Kennedy did not like to mention the word *together*.

Clinton mentioned *challenge(s)* quite a bit in his 1996 address.

Reagan loved to talk about *growth*.

Bush did not like to use the word *but!*
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/012.png)


Interestingly many Presidents do not like to use the word *yes!* Obama is not shy about using it, but the recent Bush certainly was. Before that, in increasing amounts to the senior Bush, peaking a Reagan (who used *yes* with higher frequency than anyone). Carter, Ford, Nixon, Kennedy, Eissenhower, and Truman never used the word in their speeches! Roosevelt was cool with it.

*no* is much more acceptable.

In recent history, Reagan used the word *god* more than other Presidents. Carter never once used the word in any of his addresses.

The younger Bush used *faith* more often than Clinton and Obama. Reagan inconsistently used it, but made up for it when he did.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/023.png)


Reagan was one of the few Presidents to mention *Pray* and used it most in his last address.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/024.png)


There was a doldrum of *dream* with Carter and Ford (and also with Truman and Eissenhower before that).

This is really interesting. Look at the chart for references to *tonight*. Before Jonhnson, there was no reference to the word in any of the speeches. Why is this? I don't know enough about the history of the addresses (perhaps a reader of this blog can educate me?), but I suspect that 1965 may have been the year they changed the timing of the event to occur around 9:00 pm EST?
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/026.png)


The word *today* is flatter, but Carter was less likely to talk using that word.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/027.png)


Truman never spoke about *tomorrow*. It seems common for Presidents to rarely mention tomorrow. Obama, Clinton, Bush Senior, and Reagan are the exceptions.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/028.png)


Nixon always talked about something *historic*. Reagan and Carter liked to talk about it to. Obama only mentioned the word in his first address. (Truman mentioned it in his first and last).
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/030.png)


Bush senior and Reagan talked about the *future* most. Clinton and Bush junior not so much. Obama is mentioning it more than Bush.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/031.png)


It's less common to talk about the *past* these days (unless you were Bush junior giving your last address).

The complete opposite to *past* is true about *America/American/Americans*. It appears to be the up-and-coming buzzword to mention in one's address. Each President is patriotically using it more than their predecessor.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/033.png)


The word *government* was most popularly used by Nixon.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/034.png)


Nixon, Carter and Ford talked about *nation* more than the other Presidents.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/035.png)


The word *united* was popular during and post WWII. Reagan and Clinton did not use it much.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/037.png)


Reagan referenced *constitution* more than any other President, but a quick look shows us that he did this in his 1987 address. Of course, 1987 is the bicentennial anniversary of the Constitution, and the spike in occurences corresponds with his address references to this event.

Roosevelt also referenced the constitution in his 1937 address, corresponding to the 150th year anniversary!
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/038.png)


Clinton and Bush junior liked to embrace people by including the word *fellow*, typically before the word citizens. Eissenhower, Truman and Nixon were less buddy.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/039.png)


Interestingly, references to the *world*, have fallen slowly over time. Truman was the President who mentioned it most in the last centurty.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/040.png)


Similarly falling are references to *europe*. It's interesting to note that, as time progresses, the speeches become more about *America*, and less about the *World* and *Europe*.

*Jobs* is clearly something very important to Obama. He's mentioned the word more than any other President, and with each address, his use increases. (Most other Presidents mentioned it on their first address, and it's use declines over subsquent addresses: Bush junior, Clinton, Reagan, Carter, Ford, Jonhnson).
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/042.png)


*Social Security* was a hot topic for Bush junior on both his opening term addresses, but not mentioned much outside of these times. Clinton was the only other President to give it more than a cursory mention. Nixon never mentioned it.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/044.png)


Who talks about a *recession*? Obama does (but his references are relaxing). Bush junior did in his first half of office. Clinton towards the end, and Reagan at the beginning. Ford and Kennedy mentioned at each address.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/045.png)


Bush junior never once mentioned the words *depression* or *depressed*.

Obama and Nixon do not *wish*. Neither did Bush senior.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/051.png)


Bush junior, Reagan, Carter, Ford and Nixon did not really use the word *loan(s)*. Obama and Clinton certainly made up for it!
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/052.png)


Another word that starts off strong at the begining of a President's term, but falls off with time is *budget*. Reagan was the only President whose use increased over time.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/053.png)


The mention of *tax(es)* is slowly increasing over time. Bush senior and Carter did not mention them as much as other Presidents.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/054.png)


*Debt* is a word that Presidents don't like to use, but Obama and Clinton always seemed to squeak in a reference to. Similarly to Social Security, it appears to be something to mention in your first address, and then not mention again.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/056.png)


Nobody has mentioned more about *bank(s)* than Obama.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/059.png)


Obama is not shy about using the word *deficit* too. Clinton the same.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/060.png)


*Crisis* was an opening peak from Obama, and he still uses the word. Carter also started out strong with it. Eissenhower did not really mention it.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/062.png)


Cliton used the word *Reward*. Ford and Nixon never did.

Bush junior's use of the word *Law* spiked in reference to law enforcement and asking for renewal of the Patriot Act.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/069.png)


Reference to *congress* seems to peak in the middle of each President. At the start of a new President, it's low, rises in the middle, and then falls again towards the end of their term.

Some Presidents mentioned the *speaker*, others did not.

Clinton never mentioned *oil*. Ford's first address was the peak.

Ford made mention to an *energy* crisis.

A new trending topic for Obama is *manufacturing*.

Obama in not afraid to say *bad*.

nobody used *evil* like Bush junior. Every address had a mention.

Clinton, Bush senior, and Reagan would call things *wrong*.

It's less likely to here the word *strong* these days …

Nixon did not talk about *citizens*. Bush junior did the most recently. As referenced above, Obama seems to prefer the term *Americans*.

Although Clinton and Bush junior used the word *Comrade*, these uses were in refernce to military companions :)

Clinton talked about *children* more than any other recent President.

Bush junior talked less about *education* than any other recent President.

Bush junior's 2005 address was big on references to *retirement*.

The spike in reference to *War* corresponds to World War II
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/124.png)


Sadly, talk of *peace* is decreasing very slightly over time.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/125.png)


*terrorism* raises its ugly head during the Bush junior administration.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/126.png)


*freedom* is correspondingly higher over the same period, and also during the Reagan arena.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/128.png)


*Victory* is mentioned after WWII and also during 2006 for in reference to 'victory' in Iraq.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/129.png)


*Veterans* get sparse mention. Obama, Clinton, Eissenhower and Truman being the only significant mentions.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/131.png)


*nuclear* was not mentioned until 1954. It's references peaking in the Carters years in 1979 with the discussion on SALT II.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/132.png)


The word *safer* made an appearance with President Reagan, and has stayed in common use.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/133.png)


The increase the use of the word *troops* highlights our involvement, in more recent years, in military campaigns.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/135.png)


It is clear from frequency and use of that word that Bush junior indicated an *Enemy*, and ditto Roosevelt during WWII. Other Presidents have shied away from this word.

Eissenhower and Truman made many references to the *military* during their addresses.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/137.png)


*Germany* is mentioned during WWII, and also during reunification.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/143.png)


You can identify the dates of the *korean* war from the references in the Truman and Eissenhower addresses …

… similarly *Vietnam*.

Clinton was the President who used *Thank* with higher frequency than any other President.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/169.png)


In his last address, Jonhnson used the repeated theme of the phrase *I think …*.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/170.png)


There's a slight decline in the use of *action*.

Again, Jonhnson's 1964 address had a repeated theme. This time he used the phrase *every …* with high frequency.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/172.png)


It's not been common in the last ten years to use the word *very*.

Bush junior's final address had a theme also. He used the phrase *(must) trust … * multiple times.

Bush junior mentioned *relief* consistently through every address. (The highest frequency of a President since Roosevelt in 1935). Other Presidents, either not at all, or very lightly.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/196.png)


Large mentions of *production* were made before, during and after WWII.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/197.png)


After Eissenhower, Presidents now talk about *commitment*
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/198.png)


Clinton was big into talking about *communities*.
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/january52012/201.png)


Finally, on a personal note, I'm a little sad to see poor references to *space* in the addresses (Hey, I'm biased. If you've managed to read this far into my document I'm sure you'll forgive these few lines of personal indulgement). Deep in the space-race era (Eissenhower, Kennedy, Jonhnson), there were multiple references to *space*. After a rocky start, America accelerated to lead the World in space exploration. References to *space* expired through Nixon, Ford and Carter. President Reagan mention the industry again in the mid 1980's with his drive for the manned space station, and now it's pretty much a thing of the past. Obama's mention of space in his 2011 address was more as an analogy with reference to a 'Sputnik' moment, not as a call to breathe life into the industry.

America landed twelve brave men on the moon 40 years ago, and we've not been back since. Ask yourself the rhetorical question: Which nation will be the next to land a person on the moon? China, India, Japan … Do you notice anything about the economies of these nations? Is this correlation or causation?
