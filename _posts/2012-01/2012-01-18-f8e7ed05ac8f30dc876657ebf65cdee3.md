I put in a little work on a new `crosstab` function in the main pandas namespace. It's basically a convenient shortcut to calling `pivot_table` to make it easy to compute cross-tabulations for a set of factors using [pandas](http://pandas.sf.net/.) DataFrame or even vanilla NumPy arrays!

Here's an example:

This makes it very easy to produce an easy-on-the-eyes frequency table. `crosstab` can also take NumPy arrays. Suppose we had 1 million draws from a normal distribution, and we wish to produce a histogram-like table showing the number of draws whose absolute values fall into the bins defined by `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Also, let's divide things up by sign. Using `crosstab` this becomes dead simple.

Of course since the result is a DataFrame you can customize the indexes:
