 I used to play Monopoly all the time when I was a tapering age
group swimmer. In fact, our group of friends used to have the
equivalent of a Monopoly championship each year, the winner of
which would store the coveted Monopoly board until the game the
following year. Needless to say, when my in-laws suggested that we
play Monopoly last night, I was all too eager to relive the
memories.


 During the game play last night, my wife
landed on several unowned properties the first few times around the
board and, being the ruthless businesswoman that she is, she
purchased all of them and built hotels on her first complete
set—the grey properties. Around the time that my wife started
building her hotels, I managed to trade and start building houses
on the green properties, my only properties. Things were looking
rather grim for the protagonist (that's me!) until my
father-in-law, my mother-in-law, and then my wife landed on my
green properties during the same lap around the board without
anyone landing on my wife's grey
properties.


*Oh goodie!*


This fortuitous turn of events inspired me to investigate this
further. How does the “Monopoly hat” move around the
board? Does the movement of the Monopoly hat make some property
locations more valuable than
others?


Fig. 1:

around a Monopoly board. Colored arcs represent their
respective properties in Monopoly. This simulation accounts for
Chance and Community Chest cards that randomly move players
to different parts of the Monopoly
board.

Fig. 2: Location, location, location! Ignoring rental revenue,
the various property colors are valued by how likely they are to be occupied during a particular roll of the
game. Up to around 30 rolls, some property colors are more lucrative than others at particular times of the
game.


 With these questions in mind, I sought to first visualize how a player travels around the Monopoly board by
making a movie of 1000 random Monopoly hats over 100 rolls of a Monopoly game (Fig. 1). Notice how the Monopoly
hats start out as a traveling wave that persists for almost 30 rolls. I am not sure how long a typical game of
Monopoly lasts, but I would guess that 30 rolls constitutes a significant portion of most Monopoly games,
suggesting that some property colors have more valuable locations on the board than others, depending on the
time (measured in rolls) during game play. We can quantify this effect by measuring the probability that any
particular property set is occupied after a certain number of Monopoly rolls (Fig. 2).


 In some sense, the old adage “Location, location, location!” rings true with these simulations. If
no one lands on your properties, it does not matter how much rental income your properties could provide. These
results therefore illustrate an interesting property of the Monopoly game that we observed during our game last
night (and you have probably noticed yourself); temporal fluctuations in property occupation can dramatically
alter relative property values. Although this does not entirely explain the sequence of events that turned my
wife's bad fortune into my fortune, it is interesting to consider how the dynamics of game play can ultimately
influence performance and outcomes.


 Of course, if you have some other ideas about what all of these means, please share! Perhaps I will explore
other ideas in subsequent blogs...
