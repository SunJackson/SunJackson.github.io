I put together a couple demo videos for our Active Categorical Classifier (ACC) project that we’ll be presenting at the [PPSN 2016](http://ppsn2016.org/.) conference.

If you’re interested in this project and can’t wait for PPSN, we have:

In the first video, I show the entire image as the ACC roams around it trying to classify the object. Even though we can see the entire image at once, the ACC only sees the 9 pixels in its immediate vicinity.



In the second video below, I only show the pixels that the ACC has seen during the simulation. Can you guess what digit it is before the ACC?



I think the second video does a great job of showing how little information the ACC is processing to classify each image. Talk about a light-weight classifier!
