Visibly the sentiment has quite considerably declined, there are much 
fewer tweets praising deep learning as the ultimate algorithm, the papers 
are becoming less "revolutionary" and much more "evolutionary". Deepmind 
hasn't shown anything breathtaking since their Alpha Go zero [and even that 
wasn't that exciting, given the obscene amount of compute necessary and 
applicability to games only - see Moravec's 
paradox]. OpenAI was rather quiet, with their last media outburst being 
the Dota 2 playing 
agent [which I suppose was meant to create as much buzz as Alpha 
Go, but fizzled out rather quickly]. In fact articles 
began showing up that even Google in fact does not know what to do with 
Deepmind, as their results are apparently not as practical as originally 
expected... As for the prominent researchers, they've been generally touring 
around meeting with government officials in Canada or France to secure their 
future grants, Yann Lecun even stepped 
down (rather symbolically) from the Head of Research to Chief AI 
scientist at Facebook. This gradual shift from rich, big corporations to 
government sponsored institutes suggests to me that the interest in this 
kind of research within these corporations (I think of Google and Facebook) 
is actually slowly winding down. Again these are all early signs, nothing 
spoken out loud, just the body language.
