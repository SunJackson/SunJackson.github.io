**The Data Incubator** recently teamed up with MRI Network to increase its access to hiring partnerships worldwide. MRINetwork is comprised of over 1,500 search professionals who specialize in hundreds of industries, many of who came from the industries in which they now recruit. MRI recruiters combine their in depth understanding of industry; with the knowledge of who is who in almost any discipline in order to jump start the search for an enterprise’s next impact player or an entire division.

The addition of MRI Network, and its network of existing clients, will **add thousands of hiring partners on top of TDI’s existing 300+ hiring partnerships**. As the need for data scientists has increased exponentially over the past few years, MRI provides TDI students with immediate access to new data science positions in geographies worldwide, as well as greater access to companies with a fundamental need for the data science talent required to harness the power of their data. 

TDI’s partnership with MRI represents a key inflection point in the already rapid growth of our company. TDI will be increasing the size of its fellowship program, as well as its online programs, to ensure that we can keep up with the needs of one of the world’s premier staffing solutions provider in MRI. **Placement services will now be open to those participating in our Data Science Foundations and Machine Learning online programs.** If you are interested in a career in data science, please apply for either for one of our programs today.
