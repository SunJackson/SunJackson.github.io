O’Reilly and Microsoft are excited bring you a new e-book on AI, titled [**A Developer’s Guide to Building AI Applications**](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-ai-developers-bot-ebook.html). 

This book, which is clearly developer-focused, walks you through the process of building intelligent cloud-based bots, and makes relevant code samples available from GitHub. As you know, AI is accelerating the digital transformation of every industry on the planet. It is our goal to allow developers and organizations of all stripes to be able to use AI successfully to augment human ingenuity and create the next generation of intelligent apps. Through this new e-book, Anand Raman and Wee Hyong Tok of Microsoft provide a comprehensive roadmap for developers to build their first AI-infused application.

Using the example of a “Conference Buddy”, you’ll learn the key ingredients needed to develop an intelligent chatbot – one that helps the attendees at a conference interact with speakers in a novel way.

The e-book attempts to provide a gentle introduction to the tools, infrastructure and services in the Microsoft AI Platform that allow you to create intelligent applications. More specifically, you will learn about:

- How the intersection of cloud, data and AI is enabling developers and organizations all over the world to build intelligent systems.

- The tools, infrastructure, and services that are available as part of the Microsoft AI Platform.

- How to teach your bot/application new AI skills, such as making use of pre-built AI capabilities around computer vision, speech and translation.

- The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and how and why ONNX may be relevant to your AI work.


Note that registration is required in order to download the free e-book. We hope you find the e-book to be a useful resource in your AI journey.
