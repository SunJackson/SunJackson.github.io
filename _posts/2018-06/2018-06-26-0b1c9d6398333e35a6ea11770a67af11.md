I just happened to come across [this quote](http://andrewgelman.com/2018/01/03/now-andy-hear-one) from Dan Simpson:

> When the signal-to-noise ratio is high, modern machine learning methods trounce classical statistical methods when it comes to prediction. The role of statistics in this case is really to boost the signal-to-noise ratio through the understanding of things like experimental design.
