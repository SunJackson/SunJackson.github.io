 Data are becoming the new raw material of business

Holden Karau presented a super fast introduction to PySpark – how to use Python and Spark together when you exceed the limitations of a single machine. Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for distributed computing & big data processing with APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R. This tutorial will briefly introduce PySpark (the Python API for Spark) with some hands-on-exercises combined with a quick introduction to Spark’s core concepts. We will cover the obligatory wordcount example which comes in with every big-data tutorial, as well as discuss Spark’s unique methods for handling node failure and other relevant internals.

**Michael Li** founded [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/), a New York-based training program that turns talented PhDs from academia into workplace-ready data scientists and quants. The program is free to Fellows, employers engage with the Incubator as hiring partners. Previously, he worked as a data scientist (Foursquare), Wall Street quant (D.E. Shaw, J.P. Morgan), and a rocket scientist (NASA). He completed his PhD at Princeton as a Hertz fellow and read Part III Maths at Cambridge as a Marshall Scholar. At Foursquare, Michael discovered that his favorite part of the job was teaching and mentoring smart people about data science. He decided to build a startup to focus on what he really loves. Michael lives in New York, where he enjoys the Opera, rock climbing, and attending geeky data science events.
