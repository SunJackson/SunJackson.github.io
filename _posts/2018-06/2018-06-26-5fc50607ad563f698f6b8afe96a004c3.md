Today’s machines can identify objects in photographs, predict loan repayments or
defaults, write short summaries of long articles, or recommend movies you may
like. Up until now, machines have achieved mastery through laser-like focus; most
machine learning algorithms today train models to master one task, and one task only.
We are excited to introduce **multi-task learning** in our upcoming
[webinar](https://info.cloudera.com/LP=2027?src=website&cid=70134000001SxY3),
report, and prototype. Multi-task learning is an approach to machine learning
that goes beyond single-task approaches and supercharges classification by
allowing algorithms to master more than one task at once and in parallel.

The basic idea in multi-task learning is that learning several tasks at once
allows models to benefit from relationships between tasks for improved
performance (alongside other benefits we will cover in the webinar and report). At
an intuitive level, this makes sense. A child learning to read is supported by
learning the shapes of letters and learning how to talk. Similarly, a machine
learning model that is learning to understand language benefits from learning
to identify parts of speech while concurrently learning to identify the
semantic role words play in a sentence.

##### Multi-task Learning can improve the prediction of two variables (e.g. “risk factor” and “white blood cell count”)at the same time that it improves overall performance.

Recently, multi-task learning was shown to improve the prediction of diabetic
retinopathy. A team at [Google Brain](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain),
using ophthalmology databases that store thousands of retinal images, was 
able to train a [multi-task neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09843)
to predict a variety of diagnostic attributes, from trivially easy (‘left’ or
‘right’ eye) to surprisingly difficult (‘male’ or ‘female’ patient), in addition
to the main task: the prediction of diabetic retinopathy. The outcome? Even
trained ophthalmologists were surprised by the network’s performance. The
prediction of the diabetic retinopathy task benefited from the addition of other tasks,
showing that seemingly less important tasks can be added to a
single-task algorithm (turning it into a multi-task algorithm) to support a
primary, difficult task.

Similarly,
[researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771) have improved the ability of a model trained on hospital records to predict patient
mortality by adding length-of-stay as a second target variable.
Agronomists have improved soil chemistry detection by training a
[model](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/11/1099) to learn multiple chemical
signatures simultaneously. [Roboticists](http://bons.ai/.), in a twist on concept
learning, have trained a robotic arm with MTL to satisfy both intermediate and
end goals concurrently in a way that better supports that end goal.
[Radiologists](http://www.enlitic.com/.) have used images labeled as ‘normal’ or
‘abnormal’ alongside pixel-level labels for regions-of-interest that show the
location of the abnormality to improve disease detection from imagery. And,
under the hood, [AlphaGo](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961) is using
multi-task learning. Thus, multi-task learning has proven value in many practical
settings.

Multi-task learning works only if tasks are related, of course, and not all
tasks are. If unrelated tasks are included, they may degrade the performance of
multi-task models. Tasks are likely related if they are drawn from the same
domain. The startup
[Cardiogr.am](https://blog.cardiogr.am/screening-for-hypertension-and-sleep-apnea-with-deepheart-416c9bc03efc)
trained a multi-task model to predict hypertension and sleep apnea from data
recorded by wearable heart rate sensors, and found beneficial effects. These
beneficial effects may be rooted in shared biology; the autonomic nervous
system links your heart with your brain, stomach, esophagus, liver, intestines,
pancreas, and, importantly, your blood vessels. The algorithm likely learned
heart rate variability as a predictive feature for both tasks; two independent
studies showed associations between heart rate variability and
hypertension and heart
rate variabiliy and sleep
apnea. Their results
highlight one of the fundamental benefits of multi-task learning: multi-task
models learn, in unsupervised fashion, the relation between tasks and extract
features that can support not just one but all tasks. Models trained to learn
these more abstract features tend to generalize better to new data and
(related) tasks. In “machine-learning speak,” multi-task learning prevents
overfitting and helps with model transfer.

Multi-task learning also offers a potential savings in processing time, power,
and training data. Multi-task learning is a way of training a model to do more
than one thing at a time; it can also be used to do the same thing for more
than one set of data. Using multi-task learning in such a way allows for data
augmentation: learning from several smaller datasets what one would otherwise
need a single large dataset to do. While a single-task model might be able to
find meaningful patterns in a large clinical data set (as long as the clinical
data was collected under a single protocol), a multi-task model can find
meaningful patterns across data collected under multiple protocols.

Given the value of a multi-task approach, we are likely to see more applications of multi-task learning across a range of industries and uses cases. Already, we have seen the following:

- [Medical Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09843) - Disease detection from medical imagery can be made more accurate with less data.

- [Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05932) - More accurate structure footprints can be learned using multi-task learning, facilitating property value estimates.

- [Agriculture](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/11/1099) - In-field spectroscopy detects multiple chemical profiles at once, and has made precision farming more efficient.

- [Drug Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564) - The ability of compounds to bind to several different kinds of receptor sites can be predicted concurrently.

- [Genomics](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2018/06/26/supercharging-classification-the-value-of-multitask-learning.html) - Using multi-task learning for data augmentation allows for learning across multiple cohorts of research subjects, which can ensure that any findings generalize better to a broader population.

- [Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771) - models trained by multi-task learning outperformed several (though *not all*) single-task learning models at predicting hospital stay length, mortality rate, disease phenotype (specific medical problem), and decompensation (organ failure).

- [Robotics](https://bons.ai/) - multi-task learning enables learning complex operations as multiple, related, tasks that eventually culminate in a final goal for a robotic device.

- [Natural Language Processing](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-1015) - multi-task learning has improved the detection of mental health issues based on social media data.
