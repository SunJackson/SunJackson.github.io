[R Tip](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/tag/r-tips): use `isTRUE()`.

A lot of [R](https://www.r-project.org/.) functions are *type unstable*, which means they return different types or classes depending on details of their values.

For example consider `all.equal()`, it returns the logical value `TRUE` when the items being compared are equal:

However, when the items being compared are not equal `all.equal()` instead returns a message:

This can be inconvenient in using functions similar to `all.equal()` as tests in `if()`-statements and other program control structures.

The saving functions is `isTRUE()`. `isTRUE()` returns `TRUE` if its argument *value* is equivalent to `TRUE`, and returns `FALSE` otherwise. `isTRUE()` makes `R` programming much easier.




Some examples of `isTRUE()` are given below:

Using `isTRUE()` one can write safe and legible code such as the following:

`R` now also has `isFALSE()`, but by design it does not mean the same thing as `!isTRUE()`. The ideas is: for a value `v` at most of one of `isTRUE()` or `isFALSE()` is set, and both are non-NA unnamed scalar logical values. (example: `isTRUE(5)`, `isFALSE(5)`).

Or as `help(isTRUE)` puts it:

> 
… if(isTRUE(cond)) may be preferable to if(cond) …


Note: prior to `R` 3.5 `isTRUE` (the current version!) was defined as “`isTRUE <- function(x) identical(x, TRUE)`” (please see change-log [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html)). This seemed clever, but failed on named logical values (violating a principle of least surprise):

This caused a lot of problems (example taken from [R3.5.0 NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html)):
