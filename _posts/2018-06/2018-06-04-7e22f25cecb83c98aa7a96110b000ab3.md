Been a while since a release, but category encoders has continued to advance with the help of lots of great contributors. I've just released v1.2.8, with primarily bugfixes, as well as some new features allowing a user to optionally add the category names in the output column names of some encoders.

Check out the new release here:

There are some open issues, looking for contributors as well, so if you'd like to get involved, drop a message on the github project here:
