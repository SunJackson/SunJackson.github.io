The animation below, by Shanghai University professor [Guy Abel](https://guyabel.com/#about), shows migration within and between regions of the world from 1960 to 2015. The data and the methodology behind the chart is [described in this paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/imre.12327). The curved bars around the outside represent the peak migrant flows for each region; globally, migration peaked during the 2005-2010 period and the declined in 2010-2015, the latest data available.

This animated chord chart was [created entirely using the R language](https://guyabel.com/post/animated-directional-chord-diagrams). The chord plot showing the flows between regions was created using the [circlize package](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book); the [tweenr package](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr#tweenr-) created the smooth transitions between time periods, and the [magick package](https://github.com/ropensci/magick#readme) created the animated GIF you see above. You can find a tutorial on making this animation, including the complete R code, at the link below.
