We here at [Win-Vector LLC](http://www.win-vector.com/) have some really big news we would please like the [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/.)-community’s help sharing.

[`vtreat`](https://winvector.github.io/vtreat) [version 1.2.0 is now available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vtreat), and this version of `vtreat` can now implement its data cleaning and preparation steps on databases and big data systems such as [`Apache Spark`](https://spark.apache.org/.).

[`vtreat`](https://winvector.github.io/vtreat) is a very complete and [rigorous](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09477) tool for preparing messy real world data for supervised machine-learning tasks. It implements a technique we call “safe y-aware processing” [using cross-validation or stacking techniques](https://winvector.github.io/vtreat/articles/vtreatCrossFrames.html). It is very easy to use: you show it some data and it designs a data transform for you.

Thanks to the [`rquery`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rquery) package, this data preparation transform can now be directly applied to databases, or big data systems such as [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/.), [`Amazon RedShift`](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift), [`Apache Spark`](https://spark.apache.org/.), or [`Google BigQuery`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). Or, thanks to the [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) and [`rqdatatable`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rqdatatable) packages, even fast large in-memory transforms are possible.

We have some basic examples of the new `vtreat` capabilities [here](https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat/blob/master/extras/vtreatOnSpark.md) and [here](https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat/blob/master/extras/rquery_vtreat.md).
