We here at Win-Vector LLC have some really big news we would please like the `R`-community’s help sharing.

`vtreat` version 1.2.0 is now available on CRAN, and this version of `vtreat` can now implement its data cleaning and preparation steps on databases and big data systems such as `Apache Spark`.

`vtreat` is a very complete and rigorous tool for preparing messy real world data for supervised machine-learning tasks. It implements a technique we call “safe y-aware processing” using cross-validation or stacking techniques. It is very easy to use: you show it some data and it designs a data transform for you.

Thanks to the `rquery` package, this data preparation transform can now be directly applied to databases, or big data systems such as `PostgreSQL`, `Amazon RedShift`, `Apache Spark`, or `Google BigQuery`. Or, thanks to the `data.table` and `rqdatatable` packages, even fast large in-memory transforms are possible.

We have some basic examples of the new `vtreat` capabilities here and here.
