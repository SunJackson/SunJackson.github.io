The [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/.) package [wrapr 1.5.0](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr) is [now available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wrapr).

[wrapr](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr) includes a lot of tools for writing better `R` code:

I’ll be writing articles on a number of the new capabilities. For now I just leave you with the nifty operator [coalesce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)#COALESCE) notation.




Coalesce takes values from its arguments in left to right order taking the first non-`NA` value (if any available):

For vectors each position is calculated independently, and scalars are re-cycled to vector sizes. This allows fairly complicated coalesce strategies (such as take from first two vectors if possible, else write in zero) to be expressed very succinctly:
