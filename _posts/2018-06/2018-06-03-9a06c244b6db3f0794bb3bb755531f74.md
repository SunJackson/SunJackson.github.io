A few months back I sat down with Dan at TechEmergence to talk about the work Predikto is doing out in industry. I don't write a ton about Predikto on this site, so I'll preface: we write software that predicts industrial failures. Cranes, trains, planes, and more are monitored by our software to increase uptime, safety, and revenue.

If that problem space sounds interesting to you, you can hear me and Dan talk about that and more here:

I'd also recommend his AI in Industry podcast in general, they are concise, targeted, and he's a good interviewer.

In the follow up of his trip to Atlanta to talk to a few of us, he also put together this nice piece on how Atlanta is positioned for AI work in general. Give it a read here:
