Most annoying problem in my implementation of the query system is that
it will not solve implications if the implicates are far away from each
other. For instance, if the graph of known facts is something like this

Then it will not know how to handle the query: Is x complex assuming it
is a Mersenne prime ?. This is because the vertices MersennePrime and
Complex are far away from each other and the query function does not
load the complete graph of known facts, but rather a small subgraph
centered on the assumed facts ... This was done so for efficiency
reasons, because in the initial implementation I feared that the graph
of known facts could become huge and thus making it unfeasible to search
into. But things have changed now. Known facts is not huge at all,
roughly having over 20 vertices, so it is feasible to build the complete
graph the first time query() is called and store it for future uses.
And, most important, we have implemented fast algorithms for the
[problem of boolean satisfiability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) ([DPLL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) under
sympy.logic.algorithms.dpll), so all is ready to implement these ideas
in the following days. Interestingly, there seems to me many open source
libraries for solving this problem. One that caught my attention early
is [MiniSAT](http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html), a nice little program written in C++ which is really fast
