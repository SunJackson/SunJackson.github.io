The default approach to initializing the state of an RNN is to use a zero state. This often works well, particularly for sequence-to-sequence tasks like language modeling where the proportion of outputs that are significantly impacted by the initial state is small. In some cases, however, it makes sense to (1) train the initial state as a model parameter, (2) use a noisy initial state, or (3) both. This post examines the rationale behind trained and noisy intial states briefly, and presents drop-in Tensorflow implementations.

### Training the initial state

If there are enough sequences or state resets in the training data (e.g., this will often be the case if we are doing sequence classification), it may make sense to train the initial state as a variable. This way, the model can learn a good default state. If we have only a few state resets, however, training the initial state as a variable may result in overfitting on the start of each sequence. To see this, consider that with n-step truncated backpropagation, only the first n-steps of each sequence will contribute to the gradient of the initial state, so that even if our single training sequence has one million steps, only thirty of them will be used to train the initial state.

I haven’t seen anyone evaluate this technique (edit 11/22/16: though it appears to be common knowledge), and so I don’t have a good citation for empirical results. Instead, please see the experimental results in this post.

### Using a noisy initial state

Using a zero-valued initial state can also result in overfitting, though in a different way. Ordinarily, losses at the early steps of a sequence-to-sequence model (i.e., those immediately after a state reset) will be larger than those at later steps, because there is less history. Thus, their contribution to the gradient during learning will be relatively higher. But if all state resets are associated with a zero-state, the model can (and will) learn how to compensate for precisely this. As the ratio of state resets to total observations increases, the model parameters will become increasingly tuned to this zero state, which may affect performance on later time steps.

One simple solution is to make the initial state noisy. This is the approach suggested by Zimmerman et al. (2012), who take it even a step further by making the magnitude of the initial state noise change according to the backpropagated error. This post will only take the first step of making the initial state noisy.

## Tensorflow implementations

In some cases, e.g., as in my post on variable length sequences, creating a variable or noisy initial state to match the cell state is straightforward. However, we often want to switch out the RNN cell or build complicated cells with nested states. My motivation for writing this post was to provide a method like the `zero_state` method of Tensorflow’s base RNNCell class that automatically constructs a variable or noisy intitial state.

##### Implementation model

We’ll model the implementation after the `zero_state` method of Tensorflow’s base RNNCell class, shown below with minor modifications to make it a top-level function. You can view the original `zero_state` method here.

```
import numpy as np, tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.util import nest
_state_size_with_prefix = tf.nn.rnn_cell._state_size_with_prefix

def zero_state(cell, batch_size, dtype):
 """Return zero-filled state tensor(s).
 Args:
 cell: RNNCell.
 batch_size: int, float, or unit Tensor representing the batch size.
 dtype: the data type to use for the state.
 Returns:
 If `state_size` is an int or TensorShape, then the return value is a
 `N-D` tensor of shape `[batch_size x state_size]` filled with zeros.
 If `state_size` is a nested list or tuple, then the return value is
 a nested list or tuple (of the same structure) of `2-D` tensors with
 the shapes `[batch_size x s]` for each s in `state_size`.
 """
 state_size = cell.state_size
 if nest.is_sequence(state_size):
 state_size_flat = nest.flatten(state_size)
 zeros_flat = [
 tf.zeros(
 tf.pack(_state_size_with_prefix(s, prefix=[batch_size])),
 dtype=dtype)
 for s in state_size_flat]
 for s, z in zip(state_size_flat, zeros_flat):
 z.set_shape(_state_size_with_prefix(s, prefix=[None]))
 zeros = nest.pack_sequence_as(structure=state_size,
 flat_sequence=zeros_flat)
 else:
 zeros_size = _state_size_with_prefix(state_size, prefix=[batch_size])
 zeros = tf.zeros(tf.pack(zeros_size), dtype=dtype)
 zeros.set_shape(_state_size_with_prefix(state_size, prefix=[None]))

 return zeros
```

##### Implementation

Rather than rewriting the `zero_state` method to initialize the state with a variable (or with noise) directly, we will abstract out the `tf.zeros` function, to make the method more flexible. Our abstracted function, `get_initial_cell_state`, takes an additional `initializer` argument, which takes the place of `tf.zeros` and determines how the state is initialized. This would be a simple modification, but for the fact that we need to be careful with how variable states are created (e.g., we don’t want a different variable for each sample in the batch), which pushes some of the complexity into the `initializer` function.

```
def get_initial_cell_state(cell, initializer, batch_size, dtype):
 """Return state tensor(s), initialized with initializer.
 Args:
 cell: RNNCell.
 batch_size: int, float, or unit Tensor representing the batch size.
 initializer: function with two arguments, shape and dtype, that
 determines how the state is initialized.
 dtype: the data type to use for the state.
 Returns:
 If `state_size` is an int or TensorShape, then the return value is a
 `N-D` tensor of shape `[batch_size x state_size]` initialized
 according to the initializer.
 If `state_size` is a nested list or tuple, then the return value is
 a nested list or tuple (of the same structure) of `2-D` tensors with
 the shapes `[batch_size x s]` for each s in `state_size`.
 """
 state_size = cell.state_size
 if nest.is_sequence(state_size):
 state_size_flat = nest.flatten(state_size)
 init_state_flat = [
 initializer(_state_size_with_prefix(s), batch_size, dtype, i)
 for i, s in enumerate(state_size_flat)]
 init_state = nest.pack_sequence_as(structure=state_size,
 flat_sequence=init_state_flat)
 else:
 init_state_size = _state_size_with_prefix(state_size)
 init_state = initializer(init_state_size, batch_size, dtype, None)

 return init_state
```

`initializer` must be a function with four arguments: `shape` and `dtype`, a la `tf.zeros`, and additionally `batch_size` and `index`, which are introduced to play nice with variables. We can achieve the same behavior as the original `zero_state` method with the following `initializer` function:

```
def zero_state_initializer(shape, batch_size, dtype, index):
 z = tf.zeros(tf.pack(_state_size_with_prefix(shape, [batch_size])), dtype)
 z.set_shape(_state_size_with_prefix(shape, prefix=[None]))
 return z
```

Then calling `get_initial_cell_state(cell, zero_state_initializer, batch_size, tf.float32)` does the same thing as calling `zero_state(cell, batch_size, tf.float32)`.

Given this abstraction, we add support for a variable initializer like so:

```
def make_variable_state_initializer(**kwargs):
 def variable_state_initializer(shape, batch_size, dtype, index):
 args = kwargs.copy()

 if args.get('name'):
 args['name'] = args['name'] + '_' + str(index)
 else:
 args['name'] = 'init_state_' + str(index)

 args['shape'] = shape
 args['dtype'] = dtype

 var = tf.get_variable(**args)
 var = tf.expand_dims(var, 0)
 var = tf.tile(var, tf.pack([batch_size] + [1] * len(shape)))
 var.set_shape(_state_size_with_prefix(shape, prefix=[None]))
 return var

 return variable_state_initializer
```

We can now get a variable initial state by calling `get_initial_cell_state(cell, make_variable_initializer(), batch_size, tf.float32)`.

Finally, we can add a noisy wrapper for our zero or variable state intializers like so:

```
def make_gaussian_state_initializer(initializer, deterministic_tensor=None, stddev=0.3):
 def gaussian_state_initializer(shape, batch_size, dtype, index):
 init_state = initializer(shape, batch_size, dtype, index)
 if deterministic_tensor is not None:
 return tf.cond(deterministic_tensor,
 lambda: init_state,
 lambda: init_state + tf.random_normal(tf.shape(init_state), stddev=stddev))
 else:
 return init_state + tf.random_normal(tf.shape(init_state), stddev=stddev)
 return gaussian_state_initializer
```

This wrapper adds gaussian noise to the underlying initial_state. E.g., to create an initializer function that initializes the state with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 0.1, we call `make_gaussian_state_initializer(zero_state_initializer, stddev=0.01)`. The deterministic_tensor is an optional boolean tensor that can be used to disable added noise at test time (recommended).

## An experiment on the truncated PTB dataset

Now let us test our initializers on a “truncated” PTB language modeling task. This will be the same as the regular PTB dataset, except that we will modify the usual training routine so as to *not* propagate the final state forward (i.e., it will truncate the state propagation). By reseting the state between each training step, we make the PTB dataset behave like a dataset with many state resets.

### Empirical results

From the above experiment we make the following observations:

- All non-zero state intializations sped up training and improved generalization.

- Training the initial state as a variable was more effective than using a noisy zero-mean initial state.

- Adding noise to a variable initial state provided only marginal benefit.


Finally, I would note that “truncating” the PTB dataset produced worse results than would be obtained if the dataset were not truncated, even if we use noisy or variable state initializations. We can see this by comparing the above results to the “non-regularized LSTM” from Zaremba et al. (2015), which had a very similar architecture, but did not truncate the sequences in the dataset. I would expect truncation will have this effect in general, so that these non-zero state initializations will only really be useful for datasets that have many naturally-occuring state resets.
