A (not too hard) coffee time puzzle this week. Go grab a pencil, a cup of coffee, and dust off a little geometery.
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november22016/b.png)|To the left is a unit square.A semi-circle is constructed inside the square with a diameter of one unit.The yellow line starts at the top corner, and is tangent to the semi-circle.*What is the length of the yellow line?*|

A semi-circle is constructed inside the square with a diameter of one unit.

|First, let's label the points:|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november22016/s1.png)|
|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november22016/s2.png)|The length of each side of the square is one unit.The length **BF** is also one unit. If you are familiar with the Two Tanget Theorem, this is obvious straight away, if not, convince yourself this by imagining a right angle triangle **BCO**, where **O** is the center of the circle. The hypotenuse of this triangle **OB**, is the same as the hypotenuse of the similar triangle **BFO**. As **OF** and **OC** are also the same (being radii), then **BF** is also equal to **BC**.|

The length **BF** is also one unit. If you are familiar with the Two Tanget Theorem, this is obvious straight away, if not, convince yourself this by imagining a right angle triangle **BCO**, where **O** is the center of the circle. The hypotenuse of this triangle **OB**, is the same as the hypotenuse of the similar triangle **BFO**. As **OF** and **OC** are also the same (being radii), then **BF** is also equal to **BC**.

We'll define *x* to be the distance **EF**.

Using the same tangent principle as above, this means that **DE** is also *x*, and therefore **AE** is equal to *1-x*.

Using Pythagoras on triangle **BAE**:

### Result

*Now that we know *x*, we can see that the length of **BE** = 11/4.*
