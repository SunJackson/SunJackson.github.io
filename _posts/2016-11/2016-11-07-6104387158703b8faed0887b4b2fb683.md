Our paper titled *Social bots distort the 2016 U.S. Presidential election online discussion* was published on the November 2016 issue of First Monday and selected as Editor’s featured article!

We investigated how social bots, automatic accounts that populate the Twitter-sphere, are distorting the online discussion about the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections. In a nutshell, we discovered that:

- About one-in-five tweets regarding the elections has been posted by a bot, totalling about 4 Million tweets posted during the month prior to the elections by over 400,000 bots.

- Regular (human) users cannot determine whether the source of some specific information is another legitimate user or a bot: therefore, bots are being retweeted at the same rate as humans.

- Bots are biased (by construction): Trump-supporting bots, for example, are producing systematically only positive contents in support of their candidate, altering the public perception by giving the impression that there is a grassroot positive and sustained support for that candidate.

- It remains impossible, to date, to determine who’s behind these bots (the master puppeteers): single individuals, third-party organizations, and even foreign governments may be orchestrating these operations.
