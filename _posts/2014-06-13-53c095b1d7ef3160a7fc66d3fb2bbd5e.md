### Taking Derivatives through convolution[¶](http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-06-13/first-second-derivative-convolution-quadratic-fitting-and-all-that-via-MCMC#Taking-Derivatives-through-convolution)

The first and second derivative is obtained by convenient `numpy` function `gradient` but this is not only way to take the derivative of the function. We could also apply a **high-pass** filter to get the gradient of the function. Arguably, the simplest high-pass filter `[-1, 1]` could just do that.

For the second derivative filter, we could apply one more time the same filter which will result in second derivative filter. However, the convolution operation is linear operation so instead of applying the same filter twice to the signal, we could convolve the filter with **itself** to get the second derivative filter, namely **Discrete Laplace Filter**.

#### Theory[¶](http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-06-13/first-second-derivative-convolution-quadratic-fitting-and-all-that-via-MCMC#Theory)

Derivation at least in the broad sense of derivation is defined in the continuous signals. To be able to get derivatives of finite series, we need to depend on numerical differentiation. That is, the derivation is not done in *infinitesimally* function parts but rather it would be a discrete difference. So, when we define the derviation in the discrete series more formally, we could write as follows:
$$ f^{\prime} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{f(h)} $$
