I recently met up with someone who does geospatial stuff but uses the more traditional GIS software to do it. I showed him a few things in R but not being a person who does a lot of geospatial analysis I thought I’d [ask](https://twitter.com/theStephLocke/status/981567001821958144) the lovely [#rspatial](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rspatial&src=typd) crowd what they’d recommend. Here are the compiled recommendations. Happy learning spatial R!

Feel free to comment or [tweet](https://twitter.com/theStephLocke/status/981567001821958144) your recommendations to get them added to this list.

## Packages

## Online resources

## Books

## People

In no particular order, here are the folks who were recommended to follow on Twitter for R geospatial stuff.

I’ve added all of these into a [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/theStephLocke/lists/rspatial) that you can use to read tweets from these wonderful people.
