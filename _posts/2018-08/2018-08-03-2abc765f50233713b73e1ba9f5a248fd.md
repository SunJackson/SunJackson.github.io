(This letter, which is a brief summary of this article I published in my 
Spanish blog, was 
published on RISKS, Volume 30, Issue 
78.)

The blackmailing scam consisting on hacking a user's webcam while he or she
is involved in interacting with pornographic material and threatening with
the publication of the recordings unless a payment is made has not only been
reported in the past ([1, 2]) but has inspired some recent fiction 
works
(Black Mirror - "Shut up and dance").

We have also seen the next iteration of this scam, in which, while no
recording is available, the attacker tries to fool the victim by offering a
recognizable password, and implying that a hacking operation took place
(3).

I wonder if we are yet to see another step further: from having the
recording, to pretending to have the recording, to be able to fool the
victim's contacts and make *them* believe a recording is available. I can
only expect this to happen as the skills and technologies for this attack to
become readily available at a scale:

1. Find victim.

1. Obtain pictures and videos from the public Facebook database.

1. Generate a *deepfakes* video of the kind mentioned above.

Proceed with the blackmailing scam as before, now armed with a
 recording that, while not legit, might look as such to third parties.
