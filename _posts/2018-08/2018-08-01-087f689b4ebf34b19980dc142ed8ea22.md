**SPSA-FSR** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This manuscript presents the following: (1) an improved version of the Binary Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) Method for feature selection in machine learning (Aksakalli and Malekipirbazari, Pattern Recognition Letters, Vol. 75, 2016) based on non-monotone iteration gains computed via the Barzilai and Borwein (BB) method, (2) its adaptation for feature ranking, and (3) comparison against popular methods on public benchmark datasets. The improved method, which we call SPSA-FSR, dramatically reduces the number of iterations required for convergence without impacting solution quality. SPSA-FSR can be used for feature ranking and feature selection both for classification and regression problems. After a review of the current state-of-the-art, we discuss our improvements in detail and present three sets of computational experiments: (1) comparison of SPSA-FS as a (wrapper) feature selection method against sequential methods as well as genetic algorithms, (2) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a classification setting against random forest importance, chi-squared, and information main methods, and (3) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a regression setting against minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), RELIEF, and linear correlation methods. The number of features in the datasets we use range from a few dozens to a few thousands. Our results indicate that SPSA-FS converges to a good feature set in no more than 100 iterations and therefore it is quite fast for a wrapper method. SPSA-FS also outperforms popular feature selection as well as feature ranking methods in majority of test cases, sometimes by a large margin, and it stands as a promising new feature selection and ranking method. … 

**Apache UIMA** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Unstructured Information Management Applications (UIMA) are software systems that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA is made of many things UIMA enables applications to be decomposed into components, for example ‘language identification’ => ‘language specific segmentation’ => ‘sentence boundary detection’ => ‘entity detection (person/place names etc.)’. Each component implements interfaces defined by the framework and provides self-describing metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages these components and the data flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as network services, and can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes. Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA specification (that specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by a technical committee within OASIS , a standards organization). … 

**Weighted Ordered Weighted Aggregation (WOWA)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
From a formal point of view, the WOWA operator is a particular case of Choquet integral (using a particular type of measure: a distorted probability). …
