**Rethinking Numerical Representations for Deep Neural Networks**

With ever-increasing computational demand for deep learning, it is critical to investigate the implications of the numeric representation and precision of DNN model weights and activations on computational efficiency. In this work, we explore unconventional narrow-precision floating-point representations as it relates to inference accuracy and efficiency to steer the improved design of future DNN platforms. We show that inference using these custom numeric representations on production-grade DNNs, including GoogLeNet and VGG, achieves an average speedup of 7.6x with less than 1% degradation in inference accuracy relative to a state-of-the-art baseline platform representing the most sophisticated hardware using single-precision floating point. To facilitate the use of such customized precision, we also present a novel technique that drastically reduces the time required to derive the optimal precision configuration.

**Efficient and Effective $L_0$ Feature Selection**

Because of continuous advances in mathematical programing, Mix Integer Optimization has become a competitive vis-a-vis popular regularization method for selecting features in regression problems. The approach exhibits unquestionable foundational appeal and versatility, but also poses important challenges. We tackle these challenges, reducing computational burden when tuning the sparsity bound (a parameter which is critical for effectiveness) and improving performance in the presence of feature collinearity and of signals that vary in nature and strength. Importantly, we render the approach efficient and effective in applications of realistic size and complexity – without resorting to relaxations or heuristics in the optimization, or abandoning rigorous cross-validation tuning. Computational viability and improved performance in subtler scenarios is achieved with a multi-pronged blueprint, leveraging characteristics of the Mixed Integer Programming framework and by means of whitening, a data pre-processing step.

**Image Anomalies: a Review and Synthesis of Detection Methods**

We review the broad variety of methods that have been proposed for anomaly detection in images. Most methods found in the literature have in mind a particular application. Yet we show that the methods can be classified mainly by the structural assumption they make on the ‘normal’ image. Five different structural assumptions emerge. Our analysis leads us to reformulate the best representative algorithms by attaching to them an a contrario detection that controls the number of false positives and thus derive universal detection thresholds. By combining the most general structural assumptions expressing the background’s normality with the best proposed statistical detection tools, we end up proposing generic algorithms that seem to generalize or reconcile most methods. We compare the six best representatives of our proposed classes of algorithms on anomalous images taken from classic papers on the subject, and on a synthetic database. Our conclusion is that it is possible to perform automatic anomaly detection on a single image.

**Parallax: Automatic Data-Parallel Training of Deep Neural Networks**

The employment of high-performance servers and GPU accelerators for training deep neural network models have greatly accelerated recent advances in machine learning (ML). ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow, MXNet, and Caffe2, have emerged to assist ML researchers to train their models in a distributed fashion. However, correctly and efficiently utilizing multiple machines and GPUs is still not a straightforward task for framework users due to the non-trivial correctness and performance challenges that arise in the distribution process. This paper introduces Parallax, a tool for automatic parallelization of deep learning training in distributed environments. Parallax not only handles the subtle correctness issues, but also leverages various optimizations to minimize the communication overhead caused by scaling out. Experiments show that Parallax built atop TensorFlow achieves scalable training throughput on multiple CNN and RNN models, while requiring little effort from its users.

**Can Network Analysis Techniques help to Predict Design Dependencies? An Initial Study**

The degree of dependencies among the modules of a software system is a key attribute to characterize its design structure and its ability to evolve over time. Several design problems are often correlated with undesired dependencies among modules. Being able to anticipate those problems is important for developers, so they can plan early for maintenance and refactoring efforts. However, existing tools are limited to detecting undesired dependencies once they appeared in the system. In this work, we investigate whether module dependencies can be predicted (before they actually appear). Since the module structure can be regarded as a network, i.e, a dependency graph, we leverage on network features to analyze the dynamics of such a structure. In particular, we apply link prediction techniques for this task. We conducted an evaluation on two Java projects across several versions, using link prediction and machine learning techniques, and assessed their performance for identifying new dependencies from a project version to the next one. The results, although preliminary, show that the link prediction approach is feasible for package dependencies. Also, this work opens opportunities for further development of software-specific strategies for dependency prediction.
