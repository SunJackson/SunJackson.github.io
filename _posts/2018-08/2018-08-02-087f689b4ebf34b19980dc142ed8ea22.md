**Robotic Processing Automation (RPA)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Robotic process automation (or RPA) is an emerging form of clerical process automation technology based on the notion of software robots or artificial intelligence (AI) workers. A software ‘robot’ is a software application that replicates the actions of a human being interacting with the user interface of a computer system. For example, the execution of data entry into an ERP system – or indeed a full end-to-end business process – would be a typical activity for a software robot. The software robot operates on the user interface (UI) in the same way that a human would; this is a significant departure from traditional forms of IT integration which have historically been based on Application Programming Interfaces (or APIs) – that is to say, machine-to-machine forms of communication based on data layers which operate at an architectural layer beneath the UI. … 

**CuLDA_CGS** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is a popular topic model. Given the fact that the input corpus of LDA algorithms consists of millions to billions of tokens, the LDA training process is very time-consuming, which may prevent the usage of LDA in many scenarios, e.g., online service. GPUs have benefited modern machine learning algorithms and big data analysis as they can provide high memory bandwidth and computation power. Therefore, many frameworks, e.g. TensorFlow, Caffe, CNTK, support to use GPUs for accelerating the popular machine learning data-intensive algorithms. However, we observe that LDA solutions on GPUs are not satisfying. In this paper, we present CuLDA_CGS, a GPU-based efficient and scalable approach to accelerate large-scale LDA problems. CuLDA_CGS is designed to efficiently solve LDA problems at high throughput. To it, we first delicately design workload partition and synchronization mechanism to exploit the benefits of mul- tiple GPUs. Then, we offload the LDA sampling process to each individual GPU by optimizing from the sampling algorithm, par- allelization, and data compression perspectives. Evaluations show that compared with state-of-the-art LDA solutions, CuLDA_CGS outperforms them by a large margin (up to 7.3X) on a single GPU. CuLDA_CGS is able to achieve extra 3.0X speedup on 4 GPUs. The source code is publicly available on https://…/cuMF CuLDA_CGS. …
