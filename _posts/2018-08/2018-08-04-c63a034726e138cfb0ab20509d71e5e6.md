“What is a Prediction Problem? A business problem which involves predicting future events by extracting patterns in the historical data. Prediction problems are solved using Statistical techniques, mathematical models or machine learning techniques. For example: Forecasting stock price for the next week, predicting which football team wins the world cup, etc.” Suresh Kumar Gorakala ( December 26, 2014 )
