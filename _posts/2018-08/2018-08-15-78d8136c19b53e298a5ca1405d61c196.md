We are pleased and excited to announce that we are working on a second edition of *Practical Data Science with R*!

Manning Publications has just announced the launching of the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) for the second edition. The MEAP allows you to subscribe to drafts of chapters as they become available, and give us feedback before the book goes into print. Currently, drafts of the first three chapters are available.

If you’ve been contemplating buying the first edition, and haven’t yet, never fear! If you subscribe to the MEAP for the second edition, an eBook copy of the previous edition, *Practical Data Science with R (First Edition)*, is included at no additional cost.

In addition to the topics that we covered in the first edition, we plan to add: additional material on using the `vtreat` package for data preparation; a discussion of LIME for model explanation; and sections on modeling techniques that we didn’t cover in the first edition, such as gradient boosting, regularized regression, and auto-encoders.

Please subscribe to our book, your support now will help us improve it. Please also forward this offer to your friends and colleagues (and please ask them to also subscribe and forward).

Manning is sharing a 50% off promotion code active until August 23, 2018: **mlzumel3**.
