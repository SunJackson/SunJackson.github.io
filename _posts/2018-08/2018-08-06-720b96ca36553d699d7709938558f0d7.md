By providing a scalable cloud platform for building communications experiences, Twilio enables developers and businesses to build any customer engagement into their applications using simple and powerful APIs for voice, messaging, and video. Businesses like Morgan Stanley, Marks & Spencer, Netflix, Lyft, Airbnb, and more than 50,000 others are modernizing the way they communicate with their customers using the Twilio platform.

Developers use Twilio’s Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities as the cornerstone for building modern interactive voice experiences and virtual assistants. Rather than playing static, pre-recorded media files, TTS allows for businesses to build more natural voice customer experiences using dynamically generated human-sounding speech. Starting today, Twilio offers greater TTS voice selection and control to customers through integration with Amazon Polly.

With 53 voices across 26 languages, customers can select the ideal voice to communicate with callers for their Twilio Programmable Voice applications. The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) support on Amazon Polly allows developers to have greater control over synthesized speech output, such as pronunciation, intonation, and timing. These SSML features can help refine and provide a more natural voice experience.

Refer to the Twilio announcement to learn more about the Twilio integration with Amazon Polly Text-To-Speech.
