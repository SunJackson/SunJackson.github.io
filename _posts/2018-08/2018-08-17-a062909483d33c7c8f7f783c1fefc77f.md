**Trimmed Ensemble Kalman Filter for Nonlinear and Non-Gaussian Data Assimilation Problems**

We study the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm for sequential data assimilation in a general situation, that is, for nonlinear forecast and measurement models with non-additive and non-Gaussian noises. Such applications traditionally force us to choose between inaccurate Gaussian assumptions that permit efficient algorithms (e.g., EnKF), or more accurate direct sampling methods which scale poorly with dimension (e.g., particle filters, or PF). We introduce a trimmed ensemble Kalman filter (TEnKF) which can interpolate between the limiting distributions of the EnKF and PF to facilitate adaptive control over both accuracy and efficiency. This is achieved by introducing a trimming function that removes non-Gaussian outliers that introduce errors in the correlation between the model and observed forecast, which otherwise prevent the EnKF from proposing accurate forecast updates. We show for specific trimming functions that the TEnKF exactly reproduces the limiting distributions of the EnKF and PF. We also develop an adaptive implementation which provides control of the effective sample size and allows the filter to overcome periods of increased model nonlinearity. This algorithm allow us to demonstrate substantial improvements over the traditional EnKF in convergence and robustness for the nonlinear Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 models.

**Decision-Making with Belief Functions: a Review**

Approaches to decision-making under uncertainty in the belief function framework are reviewed. Most methods are shown to blend criteria for decision under ignorance with the maximum expected utility principle of Bayesian decision theory. A distinction is made between methods that construct a complete preference relation among acts, and those that allow incomparability of some acts due to lack of information. Methods developed in the imprecise probability framework are applicable in the Dempster-Shafer context and are also reviewed. Shafer’s constructive decision theory, which substitutes the notion of goal for that of utility, is described and contrasted with other approaches. The paper ends by pointing out the need to carry out deeper investigation of fundamental issues related to decision-making with belief functions and to assess the descriptive, normative and prescriptive values of the different approaches.

**SWAG: A Large-Scale Adversarial Dataset for Grounded Commonsense Inference**

Given a partial description like ‘she opened the hood of the car,’ humans can reason about the situation and anticipate what might come next (‘then, she examined the engine’). In this paper, we introduce the task of grounded commonsense inference, unifying natural language inference and commonsense reasoning. We present SWAG, a new dataset with 113k multiple choice questions about a rich spectrum of grounded situations. To address the recurring challenges of the annotation artifacts and human biases found in many existing datasets, we propose Adversarial Filtering (AF), a novel procedure that constructs a de-biased dataset by iteratively training an ensemble of stylistic classifiers, and using them to filter the data. To account for the aggressive adversarial filtering, we use state-of-the-art language models to massively oversample a diverse set of potential counterfactuals. Empirical results demonstrate that while humans can solve the resulting inference problems with high accuracy (88%), various competitive models struggle on our task. We provide comprehensive analysis that indicates significant opportunities for future research.

**Propensity Score Weighting for Causal Inference with Multi-valued Treatments**

This article proposes a unified framework, the balancing weights, for estimating causal effects with multi-valued treatments using propensity score weighting. These weights incorporate the generalized propensity score to balance the weighted covariate distribution of each treatment group, all weighted toward a common pre-specified target population. The class of balancing weights include several existing approaches such as inverse probability weights and trimming weights as special cases. Within this framework, we propose a class of target estimands based on linear contrasts and their corresponding nonparametric weighting estimators. We further propose the generalized overlap weights, constructed as the product of the inverse probability weights and the harmonic mean of the generalized propensity scores, to focus on the target population with the most overlap in covariates. These weights are bounded and thus bypass the problem of extreme propensities. We show that the generalized overlap weights minimize the total asymptotic variance of the nonparametric estimators for the pairwise contrasts within the class of balancing weights. We also develop two new balance check criteria and a sandwich variance estimator for estimating the causal effects with generalized overlap weights. We illustrate these methods by simulations and apply them to study the racial disparities in medical expenditure.

**Neural Architecture Search: A Survey**

Deep Learning has enabled remarkable progress over the last years on a variety of tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. One crucial aspect for this progress are novel neural architectures. Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and categorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.

**On the Decision Boundary of Deep Neural Networks**

**Metric Learning for Novelty and Anomaly Detection**

When neural networks process images which do not resemble the distribution seen during training, so called out-of-distribution images, they often make wrong predictions, and do so too confidently. The capability to detect out-of-distribution images is therefore crucial for many real-world applications. We divide out-of-distribution detection between novelty detection —images of classes which are not in the training set but are related to those—, and anomaly detection —images with classes which are unrelated to the training set. By related we mean they contain the same type of objects, like digits in MNIST and SVHN. Most existing work has focused on anomaly detection, and has addressed this problem considering networks trained with the cross-entropy loss. Differently from them, we propose to use metric learning which does not have the drawback of the softmax layer (inherent to cross-entropy methods), which forces the network to divide its prediction power over the learned classes. We perform extensive experiments and evaluate both novelty and anomaly detection, even in a relevant application such as traffic sign recognition, obtaining comparable or better results than previous works.

**A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network**

Given a social network with diffusion probabilities as edge weights and an integer k, which k nodes should be chosen for initial injection of information to maximize influence in the network? This problem is known as Target Set Selection in a social network (TSS Problem) and more popularly, Social Influence Maximization Problem (SIM Problem). This is an active area of research in computational social network analysis domain since one and half decades or so. Due to its practical importance in various domains, such as viral marketing, target advertisement, personalized recommendation, the problem has been studied in different variants, and different solution methodologies have been proposed over the years. Hence, there is a need for an organized and comprehensive review on this topic. This paper presents a survey on the progress in and around TSS Problem. At last, it discusses current research trends and future research directions as well.

**Combining time-series and textual data for taxi demand prediction in event areas: a deep learning approach**

Accurate time-series forecasting is vital for numerous areas of application such as transportation, energy, finance, economics, etc. However, while modern techniques are able to explore large sets of temporal data to build forecasting models, they typically neglect valuable information that is often available under the form of unstructured text. Although this data is in a radically different format, it often contains contextual explanations for many of the patterns that are observed in the temporal data. In this paper, we propose two deep learning architectures that leverage word embeddings, convolutional layers and attention mechanisms for combining text information with time-series data. We apply these approaches for the problem of taxi demand forecasting in event areas. Using publicly available taxi data from New York, we empirically show that by fusing these two complementary cross-modal sources of information, the proposed models are able to significantly reduce the error in the forecasts.

**BlockQNN: Efficient Block-wise Neural Network Architecture Generation**

Convolutional neural networks have gained a remarkable success in computer vision. However, most usable network architectures are hand-crafted and usually require expertise and elaborate design. In this paper, we provide a block-wise network generation pipeline called BlockQNN which automatically builds high-performance networks using the Q-Learning paradigm with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. The optimal network block is constructed by the learning agent which is trained to choose component layers sequentially. We stack the block to construct the whole auto-generated network. To accelerate the generation process, we also propose a distributed asynchronous framework and an early stop strategy. The block-wise generation brings unique advantages: (1) it yields state-of-the-art results in comparison to the hand-crafted networks on image classification, particularly, the best network generated by BlockQNN achieves 2.35% top-1 error rate on CIFAR-10. (2) it offers tremendous reduction of the search space in designing networks, spending only 3 days with 32 GPUs. A faster version can yield a comparable result with only 1 GPU in 20 hours. (3) it has strong generalizability in that the network built on CIFAR also performs well on the larger-scale dataset. The best network achieves very competitive accuracy of 82.0% top-1 and 96.0% top-5 on ImageNet.

**Learning Graph Embeddings from WordNet-based Similarity Measures**

We present a new approach for learning graph embeddings, that relies on structural measures of node similarities for generation of training data. The model learns node embeddings that are able to approximate a given measure, such as the shortest path distance or any other. Evaluations of the proposed model on semantic similarity and word sense disambiguation tasks (using WordNet as the source of gold similarities) show that our method yields state-of-the-art results, but also is capable in certain cases to yield even better performance than the input similarity measure. The model is computationally efficient, orders of magnitude faster than the direct computation of graph distances.
