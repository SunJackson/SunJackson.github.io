**Neural Task Planning with And-Or Graph Representations**

This paper focuses on semantic task planning, i.e., predicting a sequence of actions toward accomplishing a specific task under a certain scene, which is a new problem in computer vision research. The primary challenges are how to model task-specific knowledge and how to integrate this knowledge into the learning procedure. In this work, we propose training a recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) network to address this problem, i.e., taking a scene image (including pre-located objects) and the specified task as input and recurrently predicting action sequences. However, training such a network generally requires large numbers of annotated samples to cover the semantic space (e.g., diverse action decomposition and ordering). To overcome this issue, we introduce a knowledge and-or graph (AOG) for task description, which hierarchically represents a task as atomic actions. With this AOG representation, we can produce many valid samples (i.e., action sequences according to common sense) by training another auxiliary LSTM network with a small set of annotated samples. Furthermore, these generated samples (i.e., task-oriented action sequences) effectively facilitate training of the model for semantic task planning. In our experiments, we create a new dataset that contains diverse daily tasks and extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

**Data Poisoning Attacks against Online Learning**

We consider data poisoning attacks, a class of adversarial attacks on machine learning where an adversary has the power to alter a small fraction of the training data in order to make the trained classifier satisfy certain objectives. While there has been much prior work on data poisoning, most of it is in the offline setting, and attacks for online learning, where training data arrives in a streaming manner, are not well understood. In this work, we initiate a systematic investigation of data poisoning attacks for online learning. We formalize the problem into two settings, and we propose a general attack strategy, formulated as an optimization problem, that applies to both with some modifications. We propose three solution strategies, and perform extensive experimental evaluation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for building successful defenses.

**Distributionally Robust Distribution Network Configuration Under Random Contingency**

Topology design is a critical task for the reliability, economic operation, and resilience of distribution systems. This paper proposes a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for designing the topology of a new distribution system facing random contingencies (e.g., imposed by natural disasters). The proposed DRO model optimally configures the network topology and integrates distributed generation to effectively meet the loads. Moreover, we take into account the uncertainty of contingency. Using the moment information of distribution line failures, we construct an ambiguity set of the contingency probability distribution, and minimize the expected amount of load shedding with regard to the worst-case distribution within the ambiguity set. As compared with a classical robust optimization model, the DRO model explicitly considers the contingency uncertainty and so provides a less conservative configuration, yielding a better out-of-sample performance. We recast the proposed model to facilitate the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. We demonstrate the out-of-sample performance of the proposed approach in numerical case studies.

**One-Shot Relational Learning for Knowledge Graphs**

Knowledge graphs (KGs) are the key components of various natural language processing applications. To further expand KGs’ coverage, previous studies on knowledge graph completion usually require a large number of training instances for each relation. However, we observe that long-tail relations are actually more common in KGs and those newly added relations often do not have many known triples for training. In this work, we aim at predicting new facts under a challenging setting where only one training instance is available. We propose a one-shot relational learning framework, which utilizes the knowledge extracted by embedding models and learns a matching metric by considering both the learned embeddings and one-hop graph structures. Empirically, our model yields considerable performance improvements over existing embedding models, and also eliminates the need of re-training the embedding models when dealing with newly added relations.

**MIaS: Math-Aware Retrieval in Digital Mathematical Libraries**

Digital mathematical libraries (DMLs) such as arXiv, Numdam, and EuDML contain mainly documents from STEM fields, where mathematical formulae are often more important than text for understanding. Conventional information retrieval (IR) systems are unable to represent formulae and they are therefore ill-suited for math information retrieval (MIR). To fill the gap, we have developed, and open-sourced the MIaS MIR system. MIaS is based on the full-text search engine Apache Lucene. On top of text retrieval, MIaS also incorporates a set of tools for preprocessing mathematical formulae. We describe the design of the system and present speed, and quality evaluation results. We show that MIaS is both efficient, and effective, as evidenced by our victory in the NTCIR-11 Math-2 task.

**Convolutional Neural Networks with Recurrent Neural Filters**

We introduce a class of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as convolution filters. A convolution filter is typically implemented as a linear affine transformation followed by a non-linear function, which fails to account for language compositionality. As a result, it limits the use of high-order filters that are often warranted for natural language processing tasks. In this work, we model convolution filters with RNNs that naturally capture compositionality and long-term dependencies in language. We show that simple CNN architectures equipped with recurrent neural filters (RNFs) achieve results that are on par with the best published ones on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and two answer sentence selection datasets.

**Automated Query Expansion using High Dimensional Clustering**

The exponential growth of information on the Internet has created a big challenge for retrieval systems in terms of yielding relevant results. This challenge requires automatic approaches for reformatting or expanding users’ queries to increase recall. Query expansion (QE), a technique for broadening users’ queries by appending additional tokens or phrases bases on semantic similarity metrics, plays a crucial role in overcoming this challenge. However, such a procedure increases computational complexity and may lead to unwanted noise in information retrieval. This paper attempts to push the state of the art of QE by developing an automated technique using high dimensional clustering of word vectors to create effective expansions with reduced noise. We implemented a command line tool, named Xu, and evaluated its performance against a dataset of news articles, concluding that on average, expansions generated using this technique outperform those generated by previous approaches, and the base user query.

**Matrix Factorization Equals Efficient Co-occurrence Representation**

Matrix factorization is a simple and effective solution to the recommendation problem. It has been extensively employed in the industry and has attracted much attention from the academia. However, it is unclear what the low-dimensional matrices represent. We show that matrix factorization can actually be seen as simultaneously calculating the eigenvectors of the user-user and item-item sample co-occurrence matrices. We then use insights from random matrix theory (RMT) to show that picking the top eigenvectors corresponds to removing sampling noise from user/item co-occurrence matrices. Therefore, the low-dimension matrices represent a reduced noise user and item co-occurrence space. We also analyze the structure of the top eigenvector and show that it corresponds to global effects and removing it results in less popular items being recommended. This increases the diversity of the items recommended without affecting the accuracy.

**Temporal Information Extraction by Predicting Relative Time-lines**

The current leading paradigm for temporal information extraction from text consists of three phases: (1) recognition of events and temporal expressions, (2) recognition of temporal relations among them, and (3) time-line construction from the temporal relations. In contrast to the first two phases, the last phase, time-line construction, received little attention and is the focus of this work. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct a linear time-line from a set of (extracted) temporal relations. But more importantly, we propose a novel paradigm in which we directly predict start and end-points for events from the text, constituting a time-line without going through the intermediate step of prediction of temporal relations as in earlier work. Within this paradigm, we propose two models that predict in linear complexity, and a new training loss using TimeML-style annotations, yielding promising results.
