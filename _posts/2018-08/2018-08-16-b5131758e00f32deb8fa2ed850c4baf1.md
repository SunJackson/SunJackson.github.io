“We have chosen R because:– It is extremely flexible, allowing us to do data collection, data management, exploratory data analysis, and other essential non-modeling tasks.– Manipulating matrices is easy.– It has sophisticated tools for modeling investment returns and for analyzing and presenting results of simulations. And it has great tools for visualizing results.– The work can be completely open and reproducible, which is essential to the success of this project.” Don Boyd ( September 02, 2014 )
