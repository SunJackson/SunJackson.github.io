**GARCH(1,1) model of the financial market with the Minkowski metric**

We solved a stylized fact on a long memory process of volatility cluster phenomena by using Minkowski metric for GARCH(1,1) under assumption that price and time can not be separated. We provide a Yang-Mills equation in financial market and anomaly on superspace of time series data as a consequence of the proof from the general relativity theory. We used an original idea in Minkowski spacetime embedded in Kolmogorov space in time series data with behavior of traders.The result of this work is equivalent to the dark volatility or the hidden risk fear field induced by the interaction of the behavior of the trader in the financial market panic when the market crashed.

**Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation**

Domain adversarial learning aligns the feature distributions across the source and target domains in a two-player minimax game. Existing domain adversarial networks generally assume identical label space across different domains. In the presence of big data, there is strong motivation of transferring deep models from existing big domains to unknown small domains. This paper introduces partial domain adaptation as a new domain adaptation scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption to that the source label space subsumes the target label space. Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to the target domain, which are vulnerable to negative transfer for the partial domain adaptation problem due to the large mismatch between label spaces. We present Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PADA), which simultaneously alleviates negative transfer by down-weighing the data of outlier source classes for training both source classifier and domain adversary, and promotes positive transfer by matching the feature distributions in the shared label space. Experiments show that PADA exceeds state-of-the-art results for partial domain adaptation tasks on several datasets.

**BooST: Boosting Smooth Trees for Partial Effect Estimation in Nonlinear Regressions**

In this paper we introduce a new machine learning (ML) model for nonlinear regression called Boosting Smooth Transition Regression Tree (BooST). The main advantage of the BooST is that it estimates the derivatives (partial effects) of very general nonlinear models, providing more interpretation than other tree based models concerning the mapping between the covariates and the dependent variable. We provide some asymptotic theory that shows consistency of the partial derivatives and we present some examples on simulated and empirical data.

**LemmaTag: Jointly Tagging and Lemmatizing for Morphologically-Rich Languages with BRNNs**

We present LemmaTag, a featureless recurrent neural network architecture that jointly generates part-of-speech tags and lemmatizes sentences of languages with complex morphology, using bidirectional RNNs with character-level and word-level embeddings. We demonstrate that both tasks benefit from sharing the encoding part of the network and from using the tagger output as an input to the lemmatizer. We evaluate our model across several morphologically-rich languages, surpassing state-of-the-art accuracy in both part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization in Czech, German, and Arabic.

**Grey-box Process Control Mining for Anomaly Monitoring and Deconstruction**

We present a new ‘grey-box’ approach to anomaly detection in smart manufacturing. The approach is designed for tools run by control systems which execute recipe steps to produce semiconductor wafers. Multiple streaming sensors capture trace data to guide the control systems and for quality control. These control systems are typically PI controllers which can be modeled as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) coupled with a control equation, capturing the physics of the process. The ODE ‘white-box’ models capture physical causal relationships that can be used in simulations to determine how the process will react to changes in control parameters, but they have limited utility for anomaly detection. Many ‘black-box’ approaches exist for anomaly detection in manufacturing, but they typically do not exploit the underlying process control. The proposed ‘grey-box’ approach uses the process-control ODE model to derive a parametric function of sensor data. Bayesian regression is used to fit the parameters of these functions to form characteristic ‘shape signatures’. The probabilistic model provides a natural anomaly score for each wafer, which captures poor control and strange shape signatures. The anomaly score can be deconstructed into its constituent parts in order to identify which parameters are contributing to anomalies. We demonstrate how the anomaly score can be used to monitor complex multi-step manufacturing processes to detect anomalies and changes and show how the shape signatures can provide insight into the underlying sources of process variation that are not readily apparent in the sensor data.

**Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction Based on Outlier Detection**

We propose a novel unsupervised keyphrase extraction approach based on outlier detection. Our approach starts by training word embeddings on the target document to capture semantic regularities among the words. It then uses the minimum covariance determinant estimator to model the distribution of non-keyphrase word vectors, under the assumption that these vectors come from the same distribution, indicative of their irrelevance to the semantics expresses by the dimensions of the learned vector representation. Candidate keyphrases are based on words that are outliers of this dominant distribution. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised keyphrase extraction methods.

**Hierarchical Attention: What Really Counts in Various NLP Tasks**

Attention mechanisms in sequence to sequence models have shown great ability and wonderful performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentence embedding, text generation, machine translation, machine reading comprehension, etc. Unfortunately, existing attention mechanisms only learn either high-level or low-level features. In this paper, we think that the lack of hierarchical mechanisms is a bottleneck in improving the performance of the attention mechanisms, and propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Mechanism (Ham) based on the weighted sum of different layers of a multi-level attention. Ham achieves a state-of-the-art BLEU score of 0.26 on Chinese poem generation task and a nearly 6.5% averaged improvement compared with the existing machine reading comprehension models such as BIDAF and Match-LSTM. Furthermore, our experiments and theorems reveal that Ham has greater generalization and representation ability than existing attention mechanisms.

**Building Safer AGI by introducing Artificial Stupidity**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) achieved super-human performance in a broad variety of domains. We say that an AI is made Artificially Stupid on a task when some limitations are deliberately introduced to match a human’s ability to do the task. An Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) can be made safer by limiting its computing power and memory, or by introducing Artificial Stupidity on certain tasks. We survey human intellectual limits and give recommendations for which limits to implement in order to build a safe AGI.

**Familia: A Configurable Topic Modeling Framework for Industrial Text Engineering**

In the last decade, a variety of topic models have been proposed for text engineering. However, except Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), most of existing topic models are seldom applied or considered in industrial scenarios. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that there are very few convenient tools to support these topic models so far. Intimidated by the demanding expertise and labor of designing and implementing parameter inference algorithms, software engineers are prone to simply resort to PLSA/LDA, without considering whether it is proper for their problem at hand or not. In this paper, we propose a configurable topic modeling framework named Familia, in order to bridge the huge gap between academic research fruits and current industrial practice. Familia supports an important line of topic models that are widely applicable in text engineering scenarios. In order to relieve burdens of software engineers without knowledge of Bayesian networks, Familia is able to conduct automatic parameter inference for a variety of topic models. Simply through changing the data organization of Familia, software engineers are able to easily explore a broad spectrum of existing topic models or even design their own topic models, and find the one that best suits the problem at hand. With its superior extendability, Familia has a novel sampling mechanism that strikes balance between effectiveness and efficiency of parameter inference. Furthermore, Familia is essentially a big topic modeling framework that supports parallel parameter inference and distributed parameter storage. The utilities and necessity of Familia are demonstrated in real-life industrial applications. Familia would significantly enlarge software engineers’ arsenal of topic models and pave the way for utilizing highly customized topic models in real-life problems.

**Neural Network Encapsulation**

A capsule is a collection of neurons which represents different variants of a pattern in the network. The routing scheme ensures only certain capsules which resemble lower counterparts in the higher layer should be activated. However, the computational complexity becomes a bottleneck for scaling up to larger networks, as lower capsules need to correspond to each and every higher capsule. To resolve this limitation, we approximate the routing process with two branches: a master branch which collects primary information from its direct contact in the lower layer and an aide branch that replenishes master based on pattern variants encoded in other lower capsules. Compared with previous iterative and unsupervised routing scheme, these two branches are communicated in a fast, supervised and one-time pass fashion. The complexity and runtime of the model are therefore decreased by a large margin. Motivated by the routing to make higher capsule have agreement with lower capsule, we extend the mechanism as a compensation for the rapid loss of information in nearby layers. We devise a feedback agreement unit to send back higher capsules as feedback. It could be regarded as an additional regularization to the network. The feedback agreement is achieved by comparing the optimal transport divergence between two distributions (lower and higher capsules). Such an add-on witnesses a unanimous gain in both capsule and vanilla networks. Our proposed EncapNet performs favorably better against previous state-of-the-arts on CIFAR10/100, SVHN and a subset of ImageNet.

**Knowledge Graph Embedding with Entity Neighbors and Deep Memory Network**

Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to represent entities and relations of knowledge graph in a low-dimensional continuous vector space. Recent works focus on incorporating structural knowledge with additional information, such as entity descriptions, relation paths and so on. However, common used additional information usually contains plenty of noise, which makes it hard to learn valuable representation. In this paper, we propose a new kind of additional information, called entity neighbors, which contain both semantic and topological features about given entity. We then develop a deep memory network model to encode information from neighbors. Employing a gating mechanism, representations of structure and neighbors are integrated into a joint representation. The experimental results show that our model outperforms existing KGE methods utilizing entity descriptions and achieves state-of-the-art metrics on 4 datasets.

**MARVIN: An Open Machine Learning Corpus and Environment for Automated Machine Learning Primitive Annotation and Execution**

In this demo paper, we introduce the DARPA D3M program for automatic machine learning (ML) and JPL’s MARVIN tool that provides an environment to locate, annotate, and execute machine learning primitives for use in ML pipelines. MARVIN is a web-based application and associated back-end interface written in Python that enables composition of ML pipelines from hundreds of primitives from the world of Scikit-Learn, Keras, DL4J and other widely used libraries. MARVIN allows for the creation of Docker containers that run on Kubernetes clusters within DARPA to provide an execution environment for automated machine learning. MARVIN currently contains over 400 datasets and challenge problems from a wide array of ML domains including routine classification and regression to advanced video/image classification and remote sensing.

**Document Informed Neural Autoregressive Topic Models**

Context information around words helps in determining their actual meaning, for example ‘networks’ used in contexts of artificial neural networks or biological neuron networks. Generative topic models infer topic-word distributions, taking no or only little context into account. Here, we extend a neural autoregressive topic model to exploit the full context information around words in a document in a language modeling fashion. This results in an improved performance in terms of generalization, interpretability and applicability. We apply our modeling approach to seven data sets from various domains and demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms stateof-the-art generative topic models. With the learned representations, we show on an average a gain of 9.6% (0.57 Vs 0.52) in precision at retrieval fraction 0.02 and 7.2% (0.582 Vs 0.543) in F1 for text categorization.

**Matrix Factorization on GPUs with Memory Optimization and Approximate Computing**

Matrix factorization (MF) discovers latent features from observations, which has shown great promises in the fields of collaborative filtering, data compression, feature extraction, word embedding, etc. While many problem-specific optimization techniques have been proposed, alternating least square (ALS) remains popular due to its general applicability e.g. easy to handle positive-unlabeled inputs, fast convergence and parallelization capability. Current MF implementations are either optimized for a single machine or with a need of a large computer cluster but still are insufficient. This is because a single machine provides limited compute power for large-scale data while multiple machines suffer from the network communication bottleneck. To address the aforementioned challenge, accelerating ALS on graphics processing units (GPUs) is a promising direction. We propose the novel approach in enhancing the MF efficiency via both memory optimization and approximate computing. The former exploits GPU memory hierarchy to increase data reuse, while the later reduces unnecessary computing without hurting the convergence of learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets show that our solution not only outperforms the competing CPU solutions by a large margin but also has a 2x-4x performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art GPU solutions. Our implementations are open-sourced and publicly available.

**Pervasive Attention: 2D Convolutional Neural Networks for Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction**

Current state-of-the-art machine translation systems are based on encoder-decoder architectures, that first encode the input sequence, and then generate an output sequence based on the input encoding. Both are interfaced with an attention mechanism that recombines a fixed encoding of the source tokens based on the decoder state. We propose an alternative approach which instead relies on a single 2D convolutional neural network across both sequences. Each layer of our network re-codes source tokens on the basis of the output sequence produced so far. Attention-like properties are therefore pervasive throughout the network. Our model yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems, while being conceptually simpler and having fewer parameters.

**A Consistent Method for Learning OOMs from Asymptotically Stationary Time Series Data Containing Missing Values**

In the traditional framework of spectral learning of stochastic time series models, model parameters are estimated based on trajectories of fully recorded observations. However, real-world time series data often contain missing values, and worse, the distributions of missingness events over time are often not independent of the visible process. Recently, a spectral OOM learning algorithm for time series with missing data was introduced and proved to be consistent, albeit under quite strong conditions. Here we refine the algorithm and prove that the original strong conditions can be very much relaxed. We validate our theoretical findings by numerical experiments, showing that the algorithm can consistently handle missingness patterns whose dynamic interacts with the visible process.

**A Basic Compositional Model for Spiking Neural Networks**

This paper is part of a project on developing an algorithmic theory of brain networks, based on stochastic Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models. Inspired by tasks that seem to be solved in actual brains, we are defining abstract problems to be solved by these networks. In our work so far, we have developed models and algorithms for the Winner-Take-All problem from computational neuroscience [LMP17a,Mus18], and problems of similarity detection and neural coding [LMP17b]. We plan to consider many other problems and networks, including both static networks and networks that learn. This paper is about basic theory for the stochastic SNN model. In particular, we define a simple version of the model. This version assumes that the neurons’ only state is a Boolean, indicating whether the neuron is firing or not. In later work, we plan to develop variants of the model with more elaborate state. We also define an external behavior notion for SNNs, which can be used for stating requirements to be satisfied by the networks. We then define a composition operator for SNNs. We prove that our external behavior notion is ‘compositional’, in the sense that the external behavior of a composed network depends only on the external behaviors of the component networks. We also define a hiding operator that reclassifies some output behavior of an SNN as internal. We give basic results for hiding. Finally, we give a formal definition of a problem to be solved by an SNN, and give basic results showing how composition and hiding of networks affect the problems that they solve. We illustrate our definitions with three examples: building a circuit out of gates, building an ‘Attention’ network out of a ‘Winner-Take-All’ network and a ‘Filter’ network, and a toy example involving combining two networks in a cyclic fashion.

**Interpreting Recurrent and Attention-Based Neural Models: a Case Study on Natural Language Inference**

Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in natural language inference (NLI) tasks. While these models are widely explored, they are hard to interpret and it is often unclear how and why they actually work. In this paper, we take a step toward explaining such deep learning based models through a case study on a popular neural model for NLI. In particular, we propose to interpret the intermediate layers of NLI models by visualizing the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals. We present several examples for which our methods are able to reveal interesting insights and identify the critical information contributing to the model decisions.

**Characterizing Neuronal Circuits with Spike-triggered Non-negative Matrix Factorization**

Neuronal circuits formed in the brain are complex with intricate connection patterns. Such a complexity is also observed in the retina as a relatively simple neuronal circuit. A retinal ganglion cell receives excitatory inputs from neurons in previous layers as driving forces to fire spikes. Analytical methods are required that can decipher these components in a systematic manner. Recently a method termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization (STNMF) has been proposed for this purpose. In this study, we extend the scope of the STNMF method. By using the retinal ganglion cell as a model system, we show that STNMF can detect various biophysical properties of upstream bipolar cells, including spatial receptive fields, temporal filters, and transfer nonlinearity. In addition, we recover synaptic connection strengths from the weight matrix of STNMF. Furthermore, we show that STNMF can separate spikes of a ganglion cell into a few subsets of spikes where each subset is contributed by one presynaptic bipolar cell. Taken together, these results corroborate that STNMF is a useful method for deciphering the structure of neuronal circuits.

**Large-Scale Learnable Graph Convolutional Networks**

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on grid-like data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches.
