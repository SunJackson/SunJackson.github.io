**Graph Capsule Network (GCAPS-CNN)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) are the most recent exciting advancement in deep learning field and their applications are quickly spreading in multi-cross-domains including bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, social networks, natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we expose and tackle some of the basic weaknesses of a GCNN model with a capsule idea presented in~\cite{hinton2011transforming} and propose our Graph Capsule Network (GCAPS-CNN) model. In addition, we design our GCAPS-CNN model to solve especially graph classification problem which current GCNN models find challenging. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed Graph Capsule Network can significantly outperforms both the existing state-of-art deep learning methods and graph kernels on graph classification benchmark datasets. … 

**Lambert W Function** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In mathematics, the Lambert W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function z = f(W) = We^W where e^W is the exponential function and W is any complex number. In other words, the defining equation for W(z) is: z = W(z)e^{W(z)} for any complex number z.![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/link.png?w=529)

**eXtensible Neural Machine Translation toolkit (XNMT)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
This paper describes XNMT, the eXtensible Neural Machine Translation toolkit. XNMT distin- guishes itself from other open-source NMT toolkits by its focus on modular code design, with the purpose of enabling fast iteration in research and replicable, reliable results. In this paper we describe the design of XNMT and its experiment configuration system, and demonstrate its utility on the tasks of machine translation, speech recognition, and multi-tasked machine translation/parsing. XNMT is available open-source at https://…/xnmt …
