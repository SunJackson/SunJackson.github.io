Derek Jones recently discussed a possible future for the `R` ecosystem in “StatsModels: the first nail in R’s coffin”.

This got me thinking on the future of `CRAN` (which I consider vital to `R`, and vital in distributing our work) in the era of super-popular meta-packages. Meta-packages are convenient, but they have a *profoundly negative impact* on the packages they exclude.

For example: `tidyverse` advertises a popular `R` universe where the vital package `data.table` never existed.

And now `tidymodels` is shaping up to be a popular universe where our own package `vtreat` never existed, except possibly as a footnote to `embed`.

Users currently (with some luck) discover packages like ours and then (because they trust `CRAN`) feel able to try them. With popular walled gardens that becomes much less likely. It is one thing for a standard package to duplicate another package (it is actually hard to avoid, and how work legitimately competes), it is quite another for a big-brand meta-package to pre-pick winners (and losers).

All I can say is: please give `vtreat` a chance and a try. It is a package for preparing messy real-world data for predictive modeling. In addition to re-coding high cardinality categorical variables (into what we call effect-codes after Cohen, or impact-codes), it deals with missing values, can be parallelized, can be run on databases, and has years of production experience baked in.

Some places to start with `vtreat`:
