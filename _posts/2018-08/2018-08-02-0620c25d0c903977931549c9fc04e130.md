Yuling prepared this poster summarizing our recent work on path sampling using a continuous joint distribution. The method is really cool and represents a real advance over what Xiao-Li and I were doing in our 1998 paper. It’s still gonna have problems in high or even moderate dimensions, and ultimately I think we’re gonna need something like adiabatic Monte Carlo, but I think that what Yuling and I are doing is a step forward in that we’re working with HMC and path sampling together, and our algorithm, while not completely automatic, is closer to automatic than other tempering schemes that I’ve seen.
