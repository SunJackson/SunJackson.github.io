**Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design. In ENAS, a controller learns to discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph within a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing between child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, which is on par with NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65%. … 

**Multi-task Determinantal Point Process (multi-task DPP)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have received significant attention in the recent years as an elegant model for a variety of machine learning tasks, due to their ability to elegantly model set diversity and item quality or popularity. Recent work has shown that DPPs can be effective models for product recommendation and basket completion tasks. We present an enhanced DPP model that is specialized for the task of basket completion, the multi-task DPP. We view the basket completion problem as a multi-class classification problem, and leverage ideas from tensor factorization and multi-class classification to design the multi-task DPP model. We evaluate our model on several real-world datasets, and find that the multi-task DPP provides significantly better predictive quality than a number of state-of-the-art models. … 

**Deep Extrofitting** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The retrofitting techniques, which inject external resources into word representations, have compensated the weakness of distributed representations in semantic and relational knowledge between words. Implicitly retrofitting word vectors by expansional technique (extrofitting), showed that our method outperforms retrofitting in word similarity task as well as is good at generalization. In this paper, we propose deep extrofitting, which is to stack extrofitting in depth. Furthermore, inspired by learning theory, we combine retrofitting with extrofitting, optimizing the result between specialization and generalization. When experimenting with GloVe, we show that our deep extrofitting not only outperforms the previous methods on most of word similarity task but also requires only synonyms. We also report further analysis on the effect of deep extrofitted word vectors on text classification task, resulting in the improvement on the performances. …
