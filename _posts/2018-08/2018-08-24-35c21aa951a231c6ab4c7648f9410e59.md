**Adversarially Learned Mixture Model (AMM)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The Adversarially Learned Mixture Model (AMM) is a generative model for unsupervised or semi-supervised data clustering. The AMM is the first adversarially optimized method to model the conditional dependence between inferred continuous and categorical latent variables. Experiments on the MNIST and SVHN datasets show that the AMM allows for semantic separation of complex data when little or no labeled data is available. The AMM achieves a state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering error rate of 2.86% on the MNIST dataset. A semi-supervised extension of the AMM yields competitive results on the SVHN dataset. … 

**Online Resource Scheduling Algorithm (DeepRM2)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
With the rapid development of deep learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) began to appear in the field of resource scheduling in recent years. Based on the previous research on DRL in the literature, we introduce online resource scheduling algorithm DeepRM2 and the offline resource scheduling algorithm DeepRM_Off. Compared with the state-of-the-art DRL algorithm DeepRM and heuristic algorithms, our proposed algorithms have faster convergence speed and better scheduling efficiency with regarding to average slowdown time, job completion time and rewards. … 

**Change Point Detection** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In statistical analysis, change detection or change point detection tries to identify times when the probability distribution of a stochastic process or time series changes. In general the problem concerns both detecting whether or not a change has occurred, or whether several changes might have occurred, and identifying the times of any such changes. Specific applications, like step detection and edge detection, may be concerned with changes in the mean, variance, correlation, or spectral density of the process. More generally change detection also includes the detection of anomalous behavior: anomaly detection. …
