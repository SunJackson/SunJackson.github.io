This one's all about nostalgia. When I was about 7 or 8 years old back in Australia, my favorite TV show by far was The Curiosity Show, a weekly series hosted by Rob (Morrison) and Deane (Hutton) — they didn't use their last names — featuring segments about science and practical experiments you could do at home. My favorite part was the experiments: I remember pestering my parents for all manner of straws, construction paper, watch batteries and wire to follow along with the TV show (and also the companion books, themed around Earth, Air, Fire and Water). So I was thrilled to find this week that the entire series is now available on YouTube. I still remember the thrill of building my own electric motor:


If you have a young child with a burgeoning interest in science, you might want to check this out. As for me, I always assumed this was a local show (it was filmed in the town where I grew up, and I'm pretty sure my Mum took me to see Rob and Deane do outdoor shows once or twice), so I was pleased to learn that it was shown it was also shown in Asia or Europe.

That's all from us for this week. We'll be back after the long weekend — see you then!
