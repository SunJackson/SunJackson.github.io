Some more *Practical Data Science with R* news.

*Practical Data Science with R* is the book we wish we had when we started in data science. *Practical Data Science with R, Second Edition* is the revision of that book with the packages we wish had been available at that time (in particular `vtreat`, `cdata`, and `wrapr`). A second edition also lets us also correct some omissions, such as not demonstrating `data.table`.

For your part: please help us get the word out about this book. Practical Data Science with R, Second Edition, R in Action, Second Edition, and Think Like a Data Scientist are Manning’s August 20th 2018 “Deal of the Day” (use code `dotd082018au` at https://www.manning.com/dotd).

For our part we are busy revising chapters and setting up a new Github repository for examples and code and other reader resources.
