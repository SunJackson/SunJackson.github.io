As more and more collections of data are becoming available on the web to everyone, non expert users demand easy ways to retrieve data from these collections. One solution is the so called Visual Query Systems (VQS) where queries are represented visually and users do not have to understand query languages such as SQL or XQuery. In 1996, a paper by Catarci reviewed the Visual Query Systems available until that year. In this paper, we review VQSs from 1997 until now and try to determine whether they have been the solution for non expert users. The short answer is no because very few systems have in fact been used in real environments or as commercial tools. We have also gathered basic features of VQSs such as the visual representation adopted to present the reality of interest or the visual representation adopted to express queries.
