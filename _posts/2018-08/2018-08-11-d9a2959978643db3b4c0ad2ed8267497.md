I left Facebook and 
Twitter 
more than 2 years go (with excellent results, I have to say), and due to being a 
bit tired, I stopped publishing the Data 
Links series. I miss a bit 
being able to share quickly those articles that I think are worth it, in this 
age of information overload, saturation, fake news, fake fake news, so-called 
news and so on.

I've decided that it would be a good idea to use my local installation of Tiny 
Tiny RSS to generate a feed of everything I find 
interesting. It's a good solution: it's fast, uses a standard format, doesn't 
depend on third parties *optimizing* it for ads and it's quite lightweight. If 
you are interested, here's the feed. There 
will be a bit of everything, but if you liked *Data Links*, there will be a lot 
of stuff there for you too.
