**Model, MetaModel and Anomaly Detection (M3A)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Alice’ is submitting one web search per five minutes, for three hours in a row – is it normal? How to detect abnormal search behaviors, among Alice and other users? Is there any distinct pattern in Alice’s (or other users’) search behavior? We studied what is probably the largest, publicly available, query log that contains more than 30 million queries from 0.6 million users. In this paper, we present a novel, user-and group-level framework, M3A: Model, MetaModel and Anomaly detection. For each user, we discover and explain a surprising, bi-modal pattern of the inter-arrival time (IAT) of landed queries (queries with user click-through). Specifically, the model Camel-Log is proposed to describe such an IAT distribution; we then notice the correlations among its parameters at the group level. Thus, we further propose the metamodel Meta-Click, to capture and explain the two-dimensional, heavy-tail distribution of the parameters. Combining Camel-Log and Meta-Click, the proposed M3A has the following strong points: (1) the accurate modeling of marginal IAT distribution, (2) quantitative interpretations, and (3) anomaly detection. … 

**Bayesian Kernel Projection Classifier (BKPC)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Bayesian kernel projection classifier is a nonlinear multicategory classifier which performs the classification of the projections of the data to the principal axes of the feature space. A Gibbs sampler is implemented to find the posterior distributions of the parameters. … 

**SecureStreams** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The growing adoption of distributed data processing frameworks in a wide diversity of application domains challenges end-to-end integration of properties like security, in particular when considering deployments in the context of large-scale clusters or multi-tenant Cloud infrastructures. This paper therefore introduces SecureStreams, a reactive middleware framework to deploy and process secure streams at scale. Its design combines the high-level reactive dataflow programming paradigm with Intel’s low-level software guard extensions (SGX) in order to guarantee privacy and integrity of the processed data. The experimental results of SecureStreams are promising: while offering a fluent scripting language based on Lua, our middleware delivers high processing throughput, thus enabling developers to implement secure processing pipelines in just few lines of code. …
