The `data.table` `R` package is *really* good at sorting. Below is a comparison of it versus `dplyr` for a range of problem sizes.

The graph is using a log-log scale (so things are very compressed). But `data.table` is routinely 7 times faster than `dplyr`. The ratio of run times is shown below.

Notice on the above semi-log plot the run time ratio is growing roughly linearly. This makes sense: `data.table` uses a radix sort which has the potential to perform in near linear time (faster than the `n log(n)` lower bound known comparison sorting) for a range of problems (also we are only showing example sorting times, not worst-case sorting times).

In fact, if we divide the `y` in the above graph by `log(rows)` we get something approaching a constant.

The above is consistent with `data.table` not only being faster than `dplyr`, but also having a fundamentally different asymptotic running time.

Performance like the above is one of the reasons you should *strongly* consider `data.table` for your `R` projects.

All details of the timings can be found here.
