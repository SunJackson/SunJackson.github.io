Our 5th annual [PyDataLondon conference](https://pydata.org/london2018) will run this April 27-29th, this year we grow from 330 to 500 attendees. As before this remains a volunteer-run conference (with support from the lovely core [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/) team), just as the [monthly meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup) is a volunteer-run event.

The [Call for Proposals](https://pydata.org/london2018/cfp) is open until the start of March (you have 2 weeks!) – first time speakers are keenly sought. Our mentorship programme is in full swing to help new speakers craft a good proposal, before it hits the (volunteer run) review committee. As usual we expect 2-3 submissions per speaking slot so the competition to speak at PyDataLondon will remain high. We also have a set of [diversity grants](https://pydata.org/london2018/about/diversity-scholarships) to support those who might otherwise not attend the conference – don’t be afraid to apply to use a grant.

[Tickets](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pydata-london-2018-tickets-42541329261) are on sale already, this year’s programme will go live towards the end of March. If you’d like a taste of what goes on at a PyDataLondon conference see my [write-up from 2017](http://ianozsvald.com/2017/06/01/pydatalondon-2017-conference-write-up)and see the [2017 schedule](https://pydata.org/london2017/schedule).

The week before the conference our generous meetup hosts AHL are holding a [Python Data Science Hackathon](https://www.ahl.com/hackathon). You should definitely apply if you’re anywhere near London (I have!). They have budget to fly in some core developers – if your project hasn’t yet applied and you’re interested in being involved with a large open-source science hackathon, please do visit their site and apply. Here you have a chance to make a strong contribution to the open source tools that we all use.

Finally – if you’re interested in learning about the jobs that are going in the UK Python Data Science world, take a look at my [data science jobs list](http://ianozsvald.com/2017/12/31/python-data-science-jobs-list-into-2018). 7-10 jobs get emailed out every 2 weeks to over 900 people and people are successfully getting new jobs via this list.
