 During our Monopoly exploits, another thing that we noticed was
that, at the conclusion of the game, there were still several
properties left that had not been purchased. In fact, no one even
had a chance to buy some of these properties because no one landed
on them! This fact was particularly detrimental for one of the
players in our game, *He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named*, who never
had an opportunity to trade any properties with any other players
before being knocked out of the game
(*He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named* only had a few properties and was
waiting for the remaining properties in his property colors
(*e.g.*, *Park Place*) to be purchased from the bank
before trading). Was *He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named*'s bad
fortune a consequence of poor strategy of waiting for the blue
properties before trading or plain old bad
luck?

For our purposes, we can quantify how quickly the properties of a
particular color become eligible for trading by quantifying the
minimum “time” that it takes for all of the properties
of a particular color to be owned. We can accomplish this by
making two simple assumptions. First, each player has unlimited
money and buys a property as soon as possible. This is a reasonable
situation in games with a reasonable number of players (say, four or
more) where the limiting factor is not money, but the likelihood
that you land on an unowned property. Second, each player tries to
get out of jail as quickly as possible, a reasonable expectation at
the beginning of games when players are eager to buy as many
properties as possible. We then simulate 1000 Monopoly games and
quantify the time—the number of turns per player—it
takes to own all of the properties.


 To get a feel
for our approach, we begin our analysis by first quantifying the
time required to own *all* of the Monopoly properties
(Fig. 1). One thing is immediately obvious; it takes less time
(fewer turns per player) for all of the properties to be owned as
the number of players are increased. Interestingly, it takes
roughly 30 turns per player before all of the properties are owned
in a four-player game (like ours). Assuming that each colored
property set is owned in the same amount of time, this suggests
that *He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named* may have been at a
disadvantage by waiting for *Park Place* before
trading.

Monopoly properties of a particular color as a function of the number of players playing the game.


 But this is not the whole story. As shown in Fig. 2, the blue properties are not owned particularly quickly
relative to the other properties on the board, particularly for a four-player game like ours. This may be due in
part to the fact that *Park Place* is
 the property that is landed on the least
frequently since it is 7 spaces from *Go To Jail*. This analysis therefore suggests that *He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named*'s
bad fortunate was, at least in part, due to poor stategy.


 This analysis also reveals a few other interesting trends that can be incorporated into a player's trading
strategy. For instance, the orange and red properties are systematically available for trading the quickest
whereas the yellow, green, and purple properties are not, a consequence of where these properties are positioned
relative to *Jail*. In contrast, the grey properties are owned in the least amount of time with six or
more players. This is due to the fact that these properties are oftentimes owned within the first turn, which
happens 15% of the time with six players and 41% of the time with ten players.


 In the context of Monopoly, this analysis demonstrates that it may be more advantageous to pursue some property
colors more aggressively than others, considering that they are owned earlier in the game. This analysis also
reveals how one might change their strategy depending on the number of players in a game; when playing with six
or more players, one might want to trade for the grey properties as aggressively as possible whereas when
playing with fewer than six players one might want to trade for the orange and red properties as aggressively as
possible.
