In August 2014, I created a [40-minute video tutorial](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r) introducing the key functionality of the dplyr package in R. dplyr continues to be my "go-to" package for data exploration and manipulation because of its intuitive syntax, blazing fast performance, and excellent documentation.

I recorded that tutorial using the latest version at the time (0.2), but there have since been **two significant updates to dplyr (versions 0.3 and 0.4)**. Because those updates introduced **a ton of new functionality**, I thought it was time to create another tutorial!

This [new tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mh1PqfsXVI&list=PL5-da3qGB5IBM6DdZ-ZV8mA0oV0U56xaq) covers the most useful new features in 0.3 and 0.4, as well as some advanced functionality from previous versions that I didn't cover last time. (**If you have not watched the [previous tutorial](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r), I recommend you do so first** since it covers some dplyr basics that are not covered in this tutorial.)

This new tutorial runs **37 minutes**, but if you only want to watch a particular section, simply click the topic below and it will **skip to that point in the video:**

1. Introduction (starts at [0:00](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI)) 

1. Loading dplyr and the nycflights13 dataset (starts at [1:12](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=1m12s)) 

1. Choosing columns: `select`, `rename` (starts at [2:28](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=2m28s)) 

1. Choosing rows: `filter`, `between`, `slice`, `sample_n`, `top_n`, `distinct` (starts at [5:40](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=5m40s)) 

1. Adding new variables: `mutate`, `transmute`, `add_rownames` (starts at [12:38](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=12m38s)) 

1. Grouping and counting: `summarise`, `tally`, `count`, `group_size`, `n_groups`, `ungroup` (starts at [15:20](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=15m20s)) 

1. Creating data frames: `data_frame` (starts at [23:01](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=23m1s)) 

1. Joining (merging) tables: `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join`, `full_join`, `semi_join`, `anti_join` (starts at [25:28](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=25m28s)) 

1. Viewing more output: `print`, `View` (starts at [31:29](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=31m29s)) 

1. Resources (starts at [34:41](http://youtu.be/2mh1PqfsXVI?t=34m41s))
