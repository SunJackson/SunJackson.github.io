Thanks to a patch by Jurjen Bos (with some additions & modifications by
me) we now got pretty printing in sympy. To see some examples, running
it from isympy (you need sympy from svn):

Still nesting doesn't work well and it certainly needs some polishing ,
but at least it works for simple things. note that pprint is just a
function defined in sympy.modules.printing.pretty , and there's nothing
specific about isympy, only that you can call it without the parenthesis
because that's a feature of ipython. For the implementation details:
following SAGE, we have agreed to put the code for creating a pretty
picture into a classmethod called __pretty__(), and pretty, pprint
is just a wrapper around that method. I also commited initial latex
support, this time using the same principle as __pretty__ (called
__latex__), instead of using xsl on the mathml. More things: we
moved the hash algorithm to use MD5 hashes so that we get the same
hashes in different platforms. Now all tests should pass ok in all
architectures
