### 
The "Creating a Data-Driven Organization" book is now available in Early Release


Another advantage is that you have the chance to input and shape the book. I would love and appreciate your feedback and comments as I have another month or so to incorporate major changes. If you have anything that you would like to add or say, feel free to add comments via the [add errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920035848) link.

Many thanks

Carl
