Following
the “elaboration
phase” workshop where we reimagined the presentation of
several analyses in Thomson
Reuters’ [InCites](http://researchanalytics.thomsonreuters.com/incites)
product, we started working on the first “quick wins”
project: redesigning the Collaborating Institutions and
Collaborating Authors reports in InCites. These reports were created
to address two primary use cases: (i) university administrators that
want to quantify the extent to which their institution and faculty
are collaborating and (ii) funding agencies that want to target
well-connected institutions and authors.



As a first stab at quantifying this information, Thomson Reuters
developed the initial collaboration reports by producing tables
of data related institution and author collaborations. The two
major challenges with presenting this information in a table is that
(i) it is very hard to convey a sense of collaboration in a tabular
format and (ii) since collaborations are between two
authors/institutions, presenting collaboration information for N
entities would require a maximum of N2 rows in a table. Here is
a screenshot of the original report illustrating these
challenges.

Keeping the initial use cases in mind, we started our redesign
process by developing several sketches that started to work out the
details of how we could visualize the collaborations between
different entities in a useful way. Our first design principle was
to evoke something that looked like institutions and authors working
together. Rather than displaying the data in its raw tabular form,
we switched to visualizing these collaborations as a network whose
nodes represented institutions or authors and whose links quantified
the extent of their collaboration.

Considering that university administrators are primarily interested
in who their main collaborators are and that funding institutions
want to evaluate the collaborative capability of individual
institutions or authors, we made the design decision to limit the
visible network to an ego network around a single focal node. It
further reduces the complexity of visualizing a massive network of
collaborations
that, although
intriguing, are overly cluttered for making quick decisions.

Combining the network view with
a [searchable table](http://datatables.net/) makes it
possible to quickly identify various focal institutions and authors
that can be examined along several different bibliometric
dimensions. We are particularly proud of this interface as it
demonstrates the utility of designing infographics starting with the
use cases of real people and iteratively improving the
concept.
