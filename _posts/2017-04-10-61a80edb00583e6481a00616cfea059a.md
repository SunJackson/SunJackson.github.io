#### Overview










Deep Mind released a new library built on top of TensorFlow that abstracts building a network into simpler blocks. Available here: [https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet) This library was released April 6th and already has 3000 stars on github (checked April 10th).

#### Install

1. Install TensorFlow


To do this (Iâ€™m on MacOSX with python2.7) If youâ€™re on another setup checkout [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

2. Install Bazel

Bazel is googles package builder. To install on Mac with homebrew. Anything else checkout [https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html)

3. Install Sonnet

Sonnet does not yet support Python3. There is a promising pull request already to set this up. But not as of April 10th 2017.

Configure will ask you some questions about what installation you would like.

Now we will run the install script:

After that is complete. Took a couple minutes for me:

Now to test everything worked ðŸ™‚

We should see:

Congratulations you have now setup Deep Mindâ€™s Deep Learning Library on top of TensorFlow
