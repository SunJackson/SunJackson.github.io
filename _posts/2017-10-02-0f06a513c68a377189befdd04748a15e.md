I’ve been telling everyone that I’d do something “data fun” when I hit 20K Twitter followers, so I posted an analysis of my podcast listeners! I used python and pandas in a Jupyter notebook for the first part, then I did a dashboard in Tableau for the last part.

Here’s a video of me explaining the analysis:


A few notes as I skim through:

- That part that was broken is where I hadn’t changed from the real IP to the random IP (sorry search bot), so I fixed that in the file below

- I pointed to the wrong thing when I was talking about how long I’d been around…Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast started in December 2015! So 1 year later there was a day larger than the 1st day for the 1st 3 episodes.

- The top IP that got 36 views – I’ll have to look into it, but I think it could be multiple IPs getting assigned the same random number. I’ll take a look and come back when I have a chance.

If you have suggestions for how to do the code in a more sensible way than how I rushed and did it, or if you have any questions, feel free to add suggestions in the comments below!
