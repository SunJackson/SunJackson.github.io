Las week took place in Paris the second [scikits.learn](http://scikit-learn.sf.net/.) sprint. It was
two days of insane activity (115 commits, 6 branches, 33 coffees) in
which we did a lot of work, both implementing new algorithms and fixing
or improving old ones. This includes: * sparse version of Lasso by
coordinate descent. Not (yet) merged into master, but can be looked from
[Olivier's branch](http://github.com/ogrisel/scikit-learn/tree/issue-77-sparse-cd). * new API for Pipeline. An example of this can be
found in the document SVM-Anova: SVM with univariate feature
selection. * documentation for the [bayesian methods](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/modules/glm.html#bayesian-regression) and cross
validation: Vincent Michel contributed a lot of documentation, mainly
taken from chapters of his thesis. * Ledoit-Wolf covariance
estimation. * Pure python [Fast ICA](http://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/scikits/learn/fastica.py) implementation. And the family
picture, featuring (from left to right): [Alexandre Gramfort](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Alexandre.Gramfort/index.fr.html),
[Bertrand Thirion](http://parietal.saclay.inria.fr/Members/bertrand-thirion), [Virgine Fritsch](http://parietal.saclay.inria.fr/Members/virgile-fritsch), [Gael Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/), Vincent
Michel, [Olivier Grisel](http://github.com/ogrisel) and me (taking the picture).
