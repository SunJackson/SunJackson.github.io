So just who uses facebook? Below is a table showing the demographic breakdown of facebook registrations in the **USA**.

The vertical axis shows age, with *13 years of age* at the top, and *65 and above* at the bottom. There is a separate row for each distinct age between these two limits. Female registrations are shown on the right with **pink** bars, and male registrations to the left with **blue** bars.

As mentioned in an earlier blog entry, the modal age for registrations in the **USA** is 20 years old, which is no surprise because of facebook's origin in colleges. Also mentioned earlier is the incredibly profilic rate of registration in the *65 and above* age bracket in the **US**. Close to one in eight new accounts being registered in the **US** are from people in this bracket.

Did you like the little bug? Forgive me, I thought it was funny! How long did it take you to realize it was not a little critter on your screen? If he annoys you, a click double-click will make him go away ... if you can catch him ... 

At the time this article was written, facebook allows registrations from 212 'countries'. The top 100 are shown below in a table, ordered in descending order of size. Interestingly, the country with the smallest facebook registrations is not the **Holy See** (Vatican City State), but is infact **Nauru** which, as trivia buffs know, is the World's smallest island nation, covering just 8.1 sq miles. Check it out on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru).

I've broken out the number of **males** and **females**, and also added a bar on the right to show the relative size of each region.

Currently, the **US** dominates facebook accounts, with *26%* of all accounts registered in that country. The top 25 countries account for *81%* of all registrations, and below **Thailand** no single country contributes more than *1%* to the registation numbers.

Here's a slightly more manageable view of the demographic profile for the **USA**. It's the same data as the large table at the top of this page (*sans* animated bug). Let's look at a few other countries to see how different their profiles are.

Countries that are similar in culture to the **US** have similarly *shaped* demoraphic profile curves. These curves look like *'inverted pears'*.

Whilst these curves are very similar, no country has quite a many *65 and older* women as the **US**.

Currently, **New Zealand** has a slightly higher percentage of *female* accounts than the **US** (which is already quite high), whilst **Canada**, **Australia** and the **UK** have fewer, but are still *female* biased.

Here are a random selection of European countries:

Moving a little further East. Each has its own story to tell. As you travel East, the number of *middle aged* and *old aged* registrations decreases.
