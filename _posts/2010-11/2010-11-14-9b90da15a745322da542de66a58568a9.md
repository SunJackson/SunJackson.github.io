So just who uses facebook? As we saw in the previous article, around the World, different demographics of people use facebook. We saw a few different profile curves of a few select countries. Below is a table of all the 212 countries that facebook currently accepts in their registations along with a measure of what percentage are **male** and what are **female**.

The column on the right gives a visual representation of the ratio of male:female facebook accounts in that country. It ranges from **33.33%** male in *Kiribati* to **89.52%** male in *Somalia*.

### Saturation

Absolute numbers are great for measuring absolute usage, but what about normalising these based on populations of each country? Some countries are very large, does that facebook adoption rate mirror this?

Below is a table showing the percentage of each country that has facebook accounts. The table shows the number of facebook registered accounts, the population of that region, followed by the percentage of the population with accounts. The table is sorted in descending order of percentage adoption.

As you can see, the *Vatican* is a prolific user of facebook! There are approx 800 people living in this location, and there are 500 registered facebook accounts from people claiming they live there. This equates to **62.5%**

It's also interesting to note that the highest percentages of facebook adoption seem to for the island regions (e.g. *Falkands*, *Iceland*, *Faroe Islands*, *Jersey*, *Cayman Islands* …) This is not a great surprise, as facebook is probably a great way for these isolated and remote locations to remain connected with the world at large.

Certain regions are very poorly represented by facebook. The *Russian Federation*, the *Ukraine* and other cyrillic languages countries, for instance, currently have their social network needs filled, not by facebook, but by a combination of **mail.ru**, **vkontakte** and **Odnoklassniki**. This explains why, despite their large populations, that their adoption rate is so low. Facebook has a challenge in these regions to compete against the entrenched local language solutions.

Similarly, *China* currently does not officially allow facebook access. They do have a healthy social network **QQZone** with over 200 million active members.

Whilst facebook is not (yet*) the most popular social network site in *India*, (**Orkut** has more registations), the small sounding *1.1%* of the population with facbook accounts should not be ignored. The country is so large that this percentage corresponds to 13 million accounts, placing *India* in 10th place in terms of absoloute registration numbers!

*It's also gaining ground rapidly, and will probably overake **Orkut** very shortly.
