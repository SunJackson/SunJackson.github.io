I recently presented some data at a conference for companies that run online dating services. As part of that presentation I did some analysis on facebook users, and their maritial status. Below is a summary of some of that work.

### Facebook is pretty big
|Over 130 million people in the USA now have a facebook account. That's over 40% of every man, woman and child who lives there.Each user of facebook can (optionally) specify their gender, relationship status, and other personal information.For example, my friend on the right is currently *In a Relationship*.First of all, I was curious what percentage of people disclosed their relationship status.A little bit of data-mining later I discovered that, in the USA, 62.9% of people complete this information on their profiles.![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32010/pie.png)Each country is different in its level of exposure. For instance, in **Turkey** only 41.6% of facebook users specify their relationship status.|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32010/luka.jpg)|

First of all, I was curious what percentage of people disclosed their relationship status.

### Tell me more
|With a little more analysis, we can drill down into the 'specified' category and find out the breakdown of relationship status. Facebook provides a quantized set of options to choose from: *Married, Single, Engaged* or *In Relationship*.The pie chart to the right shows the distribution of these in the US.We can see that **20.9%** of US facebook users are *Single*; ripe candidates for an online dating service!|![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32010/pie2.png)|

The pie chart to the right shows the distribution of these in the US.

### What are these people interested in?
![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32010/interest.jpg)


Facebook allows users to specify what that are *Interested In* as well as their gender. In the US, 35% of users complete this optional selection.

(When I collected the data, I neglected to record the *Relationship Status* specified for the people who exposed their *Interest*. It would be an interesting exercise to go back and find this out. Do more *Single* people expose their *Interest* more than *married* people? Are people *In a relationship* more likely to specify this than *Married* or *Single* people?)

Again, the level of information exposure varies considerably by location. In Turkey, just **21%** of facebook account holders expose their *Interest*.

Here is the breakdown of *interests* for the **US**:

|Sex| … Interested in Men | … Interested in Women |------
|I am Man …|2.23%|97.77%||I am Woman …|91.04%|8.96%|

Don't get too carried away with the **8.96%** *Women interested in Women* number! I'm not suggesting that women in the US are less heterosexual than men. If you examine the facebook profile page you can see that people are on facebook **Looking For** other things than just dating, such as: *Friendship* and *Networking*. People use facebook for more than just hooking up!

This is very apparent when you pull the same matrix for **Turkey**:

|Sex| … Interested in Men | … Interested in Women |------
|I am Man …|6.49%|93.51%||I am Woman …|29.66%|70.34%|

The vast majority of female facebook users in Turkey (who specify their interests), are looking to connect with other women! (**70.34%** *cf.* **8.96%** in the US). Facebook in Turkey, for women, seems a very important tool to network and find similar gender friends.

(The curious amongst you might be questioning why I have been using **Turkey** as my non-US country for comparisons. The simple reason is because the people of Turkey are huge consumers of facebook. After *The United States* which currently dominates facebook as the modal country of registrations with 130 million accounts (just over 25% of all facebook registrations), next comes *Indonesia*, followed by *The United Kingdom*, and then comes *Turkey*.)

Below is a table of the top ten countries (ordered by registrations) on facebook.

If you notice, there are significantly more *male* vs. *female* registrations in **India** and **Turkey**. Contrast this with the the **US**, for instance, which is *female* biased ... this will be a topic of a future blog post ...

### Demographic Breakdown - Who are the Single people?

As you can imagine, the amount of single people varies considerably with age, and also by gender. Below is a chart showing the breakout of US facebook users by gender, age and the percentage that are *Single*. The **pink** line shows female accounts, and the **blue** line shows male accounts.

The vertical axis shows the percentage of accounts for that gender and age are marked as *Single* in the relationship status field, and the horizontal access shows age from *13 years* of age on the left, to *65 and above* on the right.

[ For COPPA compliance reasons, there are no facebook accounts under 13 on facebook - I'll talk about this in a future posting. ]

Whilst the average number of *Single* users of facebook is **20.9%**, the percentage varies considerably between **45%** for 17 year old boys, to **6%** for 65 year old men.

As you can see, up until the mid-forties, there is always a higher percentage of Single men on facebook, than Single women. (Other than the 13 and 14 year old girls who, it seems, like to share that they are not yet in a relationhip).

### Absolute Size

We have to be careful not to fall into the trap of **relative** rather than **absolute** numbers. Whilst we know the percentage of 40 year olds that are single, we don't yet know how many 40 year olds have facebook accounts. Similary, whilst we know that a *higher percentage* of young males on facebook are single (than female), our data above showed that there are *more* female US accounts on facebook than male, so to get the true figure of **absoloute** population of single people we need a breakdown of registrations by gender and age. Here is this data:

![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32010/fbusa.png)


As we can see, accross the entire age range in the USA, there are more female registered accounts than male.

It's no big surprise to see the large modal spike in registrations around the late-teens to early twenties. Facebook's roots lie in college life.

It is, however, staggering to see the number of *Aged 65 and above* accounts appearing on facebook; It's the fastest growing demographic on facebook at the current time. Close to one in eight new accounts created on facebook in the US is from someone over 65 years old! *Go Grandparents!*

### Now to multiply

Now that we have the absoloute numbers of registered accounts for each demographic, and the percentage of those that are single, it's a case of simple multiplication to divine the number of single men on facebook *vs.* the number of single women on facebook for each age bracket.

As a final step, for every age, I've *subtracted* the number of **single females** from the number of **single males** to show which age brackets have an *surplus* of males, and which have a *deficit*. Here are the results:

![](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32010/final.png)


Bars *above* the line show ages where there is a surfeit of **single males**, and bars *below* the line show where there are more **single females** than males.

### Conclusion

It's a pretty coarse assumption that people only date people of similar age to themselves, but if we run with this, then if I were running a facebook dating service in the USA, then you can be sure that if were wanting to attract men to subscribe, then I'd be advertising and marketing to target men in their early twenties, as this is the region with the highest number of un-tapped single males.

Conversely, if I were trying to attract women to subscribe to a dating service, then the most fertile demographic is the early fifties.
