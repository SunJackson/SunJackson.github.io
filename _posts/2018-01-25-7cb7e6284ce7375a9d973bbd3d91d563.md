Since launching my [Python pandas video series](http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas) in 2016, there have been 10 new releases of the pandas library, including hundreds of new features, bug fixes, and API changes. I was running **version 0.18** at the time, but I've finally upgraded to **version 0.22** (the latest release).

Whenever I update a Python library, **I want to know two things:**

1. What are the **new features** I might want to use? 

1. What are the **API changes** I need to know about?


To figure this out, I spent a few hours skimming through the [pandas release notes](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew.html), compiling a list of changes that might be of interest to me and my students. Then I recorded **two new pandas videos** explaining these changes, so that you can benefit from my research!

## Video: [4 new time-saving tricks in pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NbY7E9hKxk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=32)

1. Create a datetime column from a DataFrame ([1:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NbY7E9hKxk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=32&t=1m18s)) 

1. Create a category column during file reading ([4:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NbY7E9hKxk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=32&t=4m24s)) 

1. Convert the data type of multiple columns at once ([7:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NbY7E9hKxk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=32&t=7m45s)) 

1. Apply multiple aggregations on a Series or DataFrame ([9:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NbY7E9hKxk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=32&t=9m48s)) 

1. **Bonus:** Download the [official pandas cheat sheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) ([13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NbY7E9hKxk&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=32&t=13m14s))


**Note:** Click on a timestamp to jump directly to that point in the video, or open the [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/justmarkham/pandas-videos/blob/master/pandas_tricks.ipynb) if you just want to read the code.

## Video: [5 new changes in pandas you need to know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5JrSCW-LY&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=33)

1. `ix` has been deprecated ([1:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5JrSCW-LY&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=33&t=1m19s)) 

1. Aliases have been added for `isnull` and `notnull` ([7:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5JrSCW-LY&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=33&t=7m4s)) 

1. `drop` now accepts "index" and "columns" keywords ([10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5JrSCW-LY&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=33&t=10m37s)) 

1. `rename` and `reindex` now accept "axis" keyword ([13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5JrSCW-LY&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=33&t=13m35s)) 

1. Ordered categories must be specified independent of the data ([16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5JrSCW-LY&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=33&t=16m18s))


**Note:** Click on a timestamp to jump directly to that point in the video, or open the [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/justmarkham/pandas-videos/blob/master/pandas_changes.ipynb) if you just want to read the code.

If you're relatively **new to pandas**, these two videos might not make a lot of sense, so I would suggest starting with my [complete pandas video series](http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas) instead.

If you want a longer introduction to any of the topics covered above, check out these **related videos:**

If you need to figure out **what version of pandas you're running**, simply `import pandas as pd`, then run `pd.__version__` (note the two double underscores).

If you want to **update pandas**, you can use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#updating-packages) if you're running the Anaconda distribution, or [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages#upgrading-packages) otherwise.

Thanks for watching! If you have any questions, I'd love to hear from you in the comments section below.
