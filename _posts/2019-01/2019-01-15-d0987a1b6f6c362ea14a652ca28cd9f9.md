As leading advanced analytics partner for RStudio, Mango Solutions are delighted to be contributing to the upcoming rstudio::conf programme with a workshop and a talk.

Two of Mangoâ€™s senior consultants, AimÃ©e Gott, Education Practice Lead and Mark Sellors, Head of Data Engineering will be sharing their R expertise with delegates.

AimÃ©e Gott will be delivering the Intermediate course on Shiny to the RStudio delegates. Used to training the world over, Mango has successfully delivered R and Python training courses, upskilling data science teams giving them the essential skills to enable delivery of data-driven insight. Mark Sellors, Mangoâ€™s Head of Data Engineering will be delivering a presentation on â€˜R in Productionâ€™, as part of the conference programme.

Mark Sellors has years of expertise in Data Engineering and works closely with RStudio to install and configure RStudioâ€™s commercial products. Mangoâ€™s relationship with RStudio forms part of their professional services partnership network in data science with R, easing the development environment and ensuring an effective adoption by Data Science teams.

The strategic partnership between Mango and RStudio is based on supporting the functionality and use of the R language and has been in existence for over 10 years. Matt Aldridge, Mango Solutions CEO said of the relationship, â€˜it has been pivotal in proving the effectiveness of R as a corporate analytic tool and we are proud at Mango to work alongside their talented and committed team â€˜.

Dave Hurst, Director of Business Development at RStudio said â€˜We are pleased to have both AimÃ©e and Mark contributing at rstudio::conf (2019). Mango Solutions is an RStudio Full Service Certified Partner, so we know first-hand the depth of expertise and practical experience that Mango offers to our mutual customers who are looking to successfully scale R with RStudio products in production.â€˜

Markâ€™s talk on R in production will focus on the increasing trend for data science models and other analytic code and in particular those associated with the application of R. Mark will look at some of the misinformation around the idea of what â€˜putting something into productionâ€™ actually means as well as provide tips on overcoming the obstacles.

Shiny is an open-source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. The Shiny training course as part of the conference, has been designed by Shiny author Joe Cheng has been aimed at the experienced Shiny developer. The workshop will improve delegatesâ€™ understanding of shinyâ€™s foundations and help them make the most of reactive programming techniques for extending and improving UI and debugging and tools for modularising applications. By the end of the two days, delegates will be able to push the envelope of what a Data Scientist and organisations and can do with Shiny.

Together, RStudio and Mango work with some of the worldâ€™s largest companies and are committed to supporting the growth and adoption of R for advanced analytics.

We hope to see you there!
