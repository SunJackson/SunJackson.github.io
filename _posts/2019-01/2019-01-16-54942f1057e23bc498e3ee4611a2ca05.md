R 3.5.2 has been released.

## Industry News

A retrospective of Google Research activities in AI in 2018.

Google Cloud Platform now supports R jobs (via SparkR) in Cloud DataProc.

GCP App Engine support for Python 3.7 now generally available.

Amazon SageMaker now comes preconfigured with support for SciKit-learn.

### Microsoft News
