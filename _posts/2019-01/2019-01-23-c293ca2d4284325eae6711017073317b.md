At AWS, I regularly speak with AWS customers and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners about how they are using technology to transform human health. These companies often generate large amounts of health data that they use in a variety of applications, such as population health management and electronic health records. Developers need to find ways to use the valuable medical information in these applications while meeting their compliance obligations with regard to sensitive data, such as protected health information (PHI). Some applications where our customers and APN partners are doing this today are clinical decision support, revenue cycle management, and clinical trial management.

There are multiple methods to mask data, and each organization has their own approaches based on internal risk assessments. We recommend that you consult risk assessment specialists for your organization’s specific implementation process. Typically, data is masked in two steps. First, PHI must be identified. Then, an algorithm is used that either anonymizes or de-identifies the data, usually in accordance with Safe Harbor or expert determination. This approach lends itself to using a state machine to apply the business logic your organization requires for each step independently and pass the information between states.

In this blog post, I’ll demonstrate how you can use a combination of Amazon Comprehend Medical, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon DynamoDB to identify sensitive health data and help support your compliance objectives. I’ll then discuss some potential extensions of the architecture that are patterns customers often adopt.

## The architecture

This architecture uses the following services:

- Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify entities within a body of text

- AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda to coordinate and execute the workflow

- Amazon DynamoDB to store the de-identified mapping


This architecture and the code that follows are available as an AWS CloudFormation template.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2019/01/23/identify-sensitive-data-1.gif)


## The individual components

Like many modern applications being built on AWS, the individual components within this architecture are represented as Lambda functions. In this blog post, I’ll show you how to build three Lambda functions:

- IdentifyPHI: Uses the Amazon Comprehend Medical API to detect and identify PHI entities from a body of text, such as a medical note.

- MaskEntities: Takes the entities from IdentifyPHI as input and masks them in the body of text

- DeidentifyEntities: Takes the entities from IdentifyPHI and applies a hash to each entity and stores that mapping in DynamoDB.


Let’s walk through each in turn.

### Identify PHI

The following code reads in a JSON body, extracts PHI entities from the message, and returns a list of extracted entities.

```
from botocore.vendored import requests
import json
import boto3
import logging
import threading
client = boto3.client(service_name='comprehendmedical')

def timeout(event, context):
 raise Exception('Execution is about to time out, exiting...')

def extract_entities_from_message(message):
 return client.detect_phi(Text=message)

def handler(event, context):
 # Add in context for Lambda to exit if needed
 timer = threading.Timer((context.get_remaining_time_in_millis() / 1000.00) - 1, timeout, args=[event, context])
 timer.start()
 print ('Received message payload. Will extract PII')
 try:
 # Extract the message from the event
 message = event['body']['message']
 # Extract all entities from the message
 entities_response = extract_entities_from_message(message)
 entity_list = entities_response['Entities']
 print ('PII entity extraction completed')
 return entity_list
 except Exception as e:
 logging.error('Exception: %s. Unable to extract PII entities from message' % e)
 raise e

```

The workhorse in this Lambda function is the Amazon Comprehend Medical DetectPHI API call, which returns a list of entities that Amazon Comprehend Medical identifies. Note that confidence scores are provided with each identified entity – these scores indicate the level of confidence in the accuracy of identified entities. You should take these confidence scores into account and review identified entities output to make sure they are correct. For more information on the returned data structure, see the DetectPHI documentation.

### Mask entities

There are multiple approaches to masking a message. In this example, we take each entity and replace it with a series of pound signs (#) corresponding to the length of the entity. The output is the message that has been input with each entity masked. You could choose whichever methods that are most meaningful to and appropriate for your business. For example, if there are multiple NAME PHI entities, you could order them as NAME1, NAME2, and so on.

Here’s the Lambda function:

```
from botocore.vendored import requests
import json
import boto3
import logging
import threading
import sys

def timeout(event, context):
 raise Exception('Execution is about to time out, exiting...')

def mask_entities_in_message(message, entity_list):
 for entity in entity_list:
 message = message.replace(entity['Text'], '#' * len(entity['Text']))
 return message

def handler(event, context):
 # Add in context for Lambda to exit if needed
 timer = threading.Timer((context.get_remaining_time_in_millis() / 1000.00) - 1, timeout, args=[event, context])
 timer.start()
 print ('Received message payload')
 try:
 # Extract the entities and message from the event
 message = event['body']['message']
 entity_list = event['body']['entities']
 # Mask entities
 masked_message = mask_entities_in_message(message, entity_list)
 print (masked_message)
 return masked_message
 except Exception as e:
 logging.error('Exception: %s. Unable to extract entities from message' % e)
 raise e

```

## De-identify entities

There are multiple methods for de-identification. The example described in this blog post is meant to demonstrate one way you can de-identify sensitive entities so that they can be reidentified later on by a user with the appropriate permissions. Here, we do several steps:

1. Apply a salt to the entity.

1. For each entity, generate a sha3-256 hash of the salted entity. Store this entity in a dictionary.

1. Replace each entity in the message with the hash generated in step 1.

1. Generate a sha3-256 hash of the de-identified message.

1. Store the entities in DynamoDB with the hashed message as the hash key and the entity hash as the range key.


Here is the Lambda function for this step. The EntityMap, which is a DynamoDB table, is read in as an environment variable:

```
from botocore.vendored import requests
import json
import boto3
import hashlib
import base64
import logging
import threading
import uuid
import os

ddb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

def timeout(event, context):
 raise Exception('Execution is about to time out, exiting...')
 
def store_deidentified_message(message, entity_map, ddb_table):
 hashed_message = hashlib.sha3_256(message.encode()).hexdigest()
 for entity_hash in entity_map:
 ddb.put_item(
 TableName=ddb_table,
 Item={
 'MessageHash': {
 'S': hashed_message
 },
 'EntityHash': {
 'S': entity_hash
 },
 'Entity': {
 'S': entity_map[entity_hash]
 }
 }
 )
 return hashed_message
 
def deidentify_entities_in_message(message, entity_list):
 entity_map = dict()
 for entity in entity_list:
 salted_entity = entity['Text'] + str(uuid.uuid4())
 hashkey = hashlib.sha3_256(salted_entity.encode()).hexdigest()
 entity_map[hashkey] = entity['Text']
 message = message.replace(entity['Text'], hashkey)
 return message, entity_map
 
def handler(event, context):
 # Add in context for Lambda to exit if needed
 timer = threading.Timer((context.get_remaining_time_in_millis() / 1000.00) - 1, timeout, args=[event, context])
 timer.start()
 print ('Received message payload')
 try:
 # Extract the entities and message from the event
 message = event['body']['message']
 entity_list = event['body']['entities']
 # Mask entities
 deidentified_message, entity_map = deidentify_entities_in_message(message, entity_list)
 hashed_message = store_deidentified_message(deidentified_message, entity_map, os.environ['EntityMap'])
 return {
 "deid_message": deidentified_message, 
 "hashed_message": hashed_message
 }
 except Exception as e:
 logging.error('Exception: %s. Unable to extract entities from message' % e)
 raise e

```

## Building the Boto3 Lambda layer

Next, we’ll create a Lambda layer containing Boto3. This is a common best practice when deploying Lambda functions in production.

Copy and paste the following code into a terminal. Feel free to change boto3env to a folder of your choice. The following example uses Python 3.6.

```
pip install boto3 --target python/.
 
# install botocore
pip install botocore --target python/.
 
# zip to four layer
zip boto3layer.zip -r python/

aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name boto3-layer --zip-file fileb://boto3layer.zip

```

Note the LayerVersionArn in the output. We’ll use this shortly.

## Building the state machine

The multiple steps within this workflow, such as data passed between steps and forking paths based on user input, can be best represented as a state machine. We’ll use AWS Step Functions to define the state machines and execute the individual Lambda functions.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2019/01/23/identify-sensitive-data-2.gif)


The state machine reads in a JSON blob containing the message text to process as well as whether to mask or de-identify the message. The overall steps are:

1. Identify PHI entities using Amazon Comprehend Medical APIs.

1. Determine whether to mask entities or de-identify.

1. Based on results of Step 2, act accordingly.


Here is the Amazon States Language code defining this state machine:

```
{
 "Comment": "State Machine that anonymizes or deidentifies PHI",
 "StartAt": "Identify PHI",
 "States": {
 "Identify PHI": {
 "Type": "Task",
 "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:IdentifyPHILambda",
 "InputPath": "$",
 "ResultPath": "$.body.entities",
 "Next": "Anonymize Or De-identify"
 },
 "Anonymize Or De-identify": {
 "Type": "Choice",
 "Choices": [
 {
 "Variable": "$.body.anonymizeOrDeidentify",
 "StringEquals": "anonymize",
 "Next": "Anonymize"
 },
 {
 "Variable": "$.body.anonymizeOrDeidentify",
 "StringEquals": "deidentify",
 "Next": "De-identify"
 }
 ],
 "Default": "Anonymize"
 },
 "Anonymize": {
 "Type": "Task",
 "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:MaskEntitiesLambda",
 "InputPath": "$",
 "ResultPath": "$.maskedMessage",
 "OutputPath": "$.maskedMessage",
 "End": true
 },
 "De-identify": {
 "Type": "Task",
 "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:DeidentifyLambda",
 "InputPath": "$",
 "ResultPath": "$.maskedMessage",
 "OutputPath": "$.maskedMessage",
 "End": true
 }
 }
} 

```

## Testing the state machine

As mentioned in the introduction, you can deploy the entire architecture using AWS CloudFormation. Launch the CloudFormation template now:

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2017/02/10/launchstack.png)


Use the LayerVersionArn output that you noticed previously in the Boto3LayerArn CloudFormation parameter.

After the CloudFormation stack deploys, you should have the following resources:

- The three Lambda functions

- A DynamoDB table containing mappings to the re-identified entities

- A Step Functions state machine

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources


Let’s take a fictional medical note, or rather a combination of what would be several notes, which was provided by the Amazon Comprehend Medical team. Notice that it’s filled with typos, which would present challenges for rules-based approaches for entity identification.

The input to the state machine takes two values. First, the note. Second, a choice of whether to anonymize the note or de-identify it. In this example we’ll de-identify the message. Here’s what that looks like:

```

In the AWS CloudFormation console, navigate to the output page and note the state machine Amazon Resource Name (ARN), you will be using it later to invoke a state machine execution.

You can test using the AWS CLI, your AWS SDK of choice, or the AWS Step Functions console. The following command shows what it would be like if you used the CLI. However, before you type the following command, copy the previous JSON and save it to example_note.json. Also replace the AWS Step Functions state machine ARN with the ARN in the CloudFormation output.

```
aws step-functions start-execution --state-machine-arn YOUR_STATEMACHINE_ARN --input file://example_note.json
```

The overall execution should take only a couple of seconds. Let’s navigate to the AWS Step Functions console to see what happened.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2019/01/23/identify-sensitive-data-3.gif)


When you ran the previous command, several things happened.

1. A Lambda function identified potential PHI entities within the note.

1. These entities were salted and the resulting combination was hashed using SHA3-256.

1. The hashes replaced the original entities in the message and the updated message was then hashed.

1. The mappings were stored in DynamoDB.

1. The hashed message is returned as the output of the execution.


You can view the output from the steps in the AWS Step Functions console. The previous message should now look like the following (formatted for ease of reading).  The de-identified message still contains valuable information that can be used, but the sensitive data has been masked using the previous masking example.

Here’s what the table looks like after two runs with the same message.

Because each entity is salted, there’s no way of mapping that hash back to the original entity without using the DynamoDB mapping table, which you can notice by repeated entities having different hashes due to salting. Additionally, since you can manage DynamoDB access using IAM, you can control who has access to the items in your table. You can then use AWS CloudTrail to audit reads from your table containing sensitive information.

## Conclusion and next steps

Protecting sensitive data is always job zero for healthcare organizations. In this blog post, I demonstrated how you can use Amazon Comprehend Medical to work with and identify protected health information. While organizations have different approaches to protect sensitive data, they follow the same architectural pattern: (1) identify the sensitive entities, and (2) apply the appropriate protection strategy for the sensitive entities as defined by your organization. A state machine is well-suited to orchestrate the two steps.

There are additional modifications you can make to this architecture to suit your needs. Here are a few ideas:

- Put the state machine behind Amazon API Gateway to add an authorization layer to process your text, as well as a gateway to the individual Lambda functions.

- Filter by the confidence of the DetectPHI call. Amazon Comprehend Medical entities have a `Score` field in addition to `Text`. You can apply a threshold to filter the calls by, depending on your business requirements.

- Use DetectPHI in conjunction with DetectEntities to help you detect and identify PHI, and also extract non-PHI entity relationships, which can be used for downstream analytics.
