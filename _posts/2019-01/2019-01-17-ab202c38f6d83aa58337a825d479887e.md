**R for Data Science: January 23rd-24th**If you want to deepen your data analysis knowledge using the most modern R tools, or you want to figure out if R is the right solution for your needs, this course is made for you!Itâ€™s the right class for people who are willing to learn about R and would like to get an overview of its capabilities for data science, or those who have very little knowledge of R.

**Outline**â€“ A bit of R history and online resourcesâ€“ R and R-Studio installation and configurationâ€“ Your first R sessionâ€“ Your first R markdown documentâ€“ R objects: data and functionsâ€“ Data import from external sources: excel and database connectionâ€“ Data manipulation with tidyverseâ€“ Tidy data with tidyrâ€“ Data visualization using ggplotâ€“ An overview of statistical models and data mining with R

**Attendees**The course is for max 4 attendees (youâ€™ll have to be fast if you want to reserve a seat!).

**Language**The course itself is taught in Italian, while all the materials are in English.

**Location**The course location is in Legnano (MI), Lombardia.

**Statistics for Data Science: January 30th-31th**

In this two-day course you will learn how to develop a broad variety of linear models with R. You will get a wide overview of the R capabilities to model and to make predictions, using a variety of examples.This course fits especially for people involved in research, but itâ€™s suitable for anyone whoâ€™s using R and wants to get an overview of statistical models with R. A background in theoretical statistics and probability is obviously required.

**Outline**â€“ t-test, ANOVAâ€“ Linear, Polynomial and Multiple Regressionâ€“ More Complex Linear Modelsâ€“ Generalized Linear Modelsâ€“ Logistic Regressionâ€“ Poisson Dep. Var. Regressionâ€“ Gamma Dep. Var. Regressionâ€“ Check of models assumptionsâ€“ Brief outlines of GAM, Mixed Models. Neural Networks, Tree-based Modelling

**Attendees**The course is for max 4 attendees (youâ€™ll have to be fast if you want to reserve a seat!).

**Language**The course itself is taught in Italian, while all the materials are in English.

**Location**The course location is in Legnano (MI), Lombardia.
