Regular blog readers will remember our seminar speaker competition from a few years ago.

We did single elimination, one match per day, alternating with the regular blog posts. See here and here for the first two contests, here for an intermediate round, and here for the conclusion.

**2019 edition**

Who would be the ultimate seminar speaker? I’m not asking for the most popular speaker, or the most relevant, or the best speaker, or the deepest, or even the coolest, but rather some combination of the above.

Our new list includes eight current or historical figures from each of the following eight categories:– Wits– Creative eaters– Magicians– Mathematicians– TV hosts– People from New Jersey– GOATs– People whose names end in f

All these categories seem to be possible choices to reach the sort of general-interest intellectual community that was implied by the [notoriously hyped] announcement of ~~Slavoj Zizek~~ Bruno Latour’s visit to Columbia a few years ago.

**The rules**

I’ll post one matchup each day at noon, starting sometime next week or so, once we have the brackets prepared.

Once each pairing is up, all of you can feel free (indeed, are encouraged) to comment. I’ll announce the results when posting the next day’s matchup.

I’ll decide each day’s winner not based on a popular vote but based on the strength and amusingness of the arguments given by advocates on both sides. So give it your best!

As with our previous contest four years ago, we’re continuing the regular flow of statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science posts. They’ll alternate with these matchup postings.
