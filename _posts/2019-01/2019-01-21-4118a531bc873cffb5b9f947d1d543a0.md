The History of PAW

The field of machine learning has come a long way, and PAW has grown and adapted right along with it. In fact, the many cross-industry PAW events have helped catalyze and solidify the field, following predictive analytics from a nascent industry to the commercial movement it is today.

Check out these historical PAW milestones, from spawning the Target-predicting-pregnancy publicity debacle, to getting dinged by the Hollywood action movie star Chuck Norris, to growing into the leading international event series it is today.

**February 2009: The inaugural Predictive Analytics World.**

The first PAW was held in San Francisco as a two-track event. It blazed the trail as the **very first vendor-neutral conference focused on machine learning's commercial deployment** – in comparison with existing academic or vendor-run conferences at the time – and remains the leading such event.

**October 2010: PAW spawns the Target-predicting-pregnancy story.**

A PAW **keynote from Target** on predicting customer pregnancy (**see the full session video here**) spawned a publicity debacle for the large retailer, which took place more than a year later in early 2012, by way of a front-page New York Times Magazine article by Charles Duhigg – an excerpt that served to publicize the launch of his book "The Power of Habit" at the time – which expounded upon the keynote's contents and was regurgitated by a media frenzy. However, **this flame-igniting article** probably misled the public about the reality behind an alleged anecdote involving a pregnant teenager.

**November 2010: PAW begins holding annual events in London.**

**September 2011: Predictive Analytics World for Government launches in Washington, DC.**

**March to October 2012: PAW begins holding three main business events per year in the U.S.: East coast, west coast, and Chicago.**

**November 2012: PAW begins holding annual events in Germany.**

**February 2013: Eric Siegel's book, "Predictive Analytics".**

The first edition of PAW Founder Eric Siegel's book, *Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die*, publishes in the U.S. It will be used in courses at over 35 universities, rank as the **#1 Amazon bestseller** in 2 categories, and be translated into 12 languages. The updated edition was released in 2016.

**March 2014: The Predictive Analytics Times news site launches as an informative sister property to the PAW events.**

**April 2013: Chuck Norris writes about Predictive Analytics World.**

Famed Hollywood action film star **Chuck Norris mentioned PAW** in a derogatory manner in an article expressing privacy concerns over the IRS's collection of social media data, as covered by a speaker from the IRS at PAW Government.

**June 2014: PAW for Manufacturing (now PAW Industry 4.0) begins as an annual event.**

**September 2014: PAW for Healthcare begins as an annual event.**

**October 2016: PAW for Financial Services begins as an annual event.**

**February 2017: PAW Industry 4.0 begins also as a repeated event in Germany.**
