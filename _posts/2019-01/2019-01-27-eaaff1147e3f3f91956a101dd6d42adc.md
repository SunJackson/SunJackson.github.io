So how could I present these results? One idea I had was a stacked bar chart, and it took a bit of data wrangling to do it. That is, the rankings were all in separate variables, but I want them all on the same chart. Basically, I needed to create a dataset with:

1 variable to represent the factor being ranked

What I ultimately did was run frequencies for the factor variables, turn those frequency tables into data frames, and merged them together with rbind. I then created chart with ggplot. Here’s some code for a simplified example, which only uses 6 factors and asks people to rank the top 3. 

First, let’s read in our [sample dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/93g4mrm1rbrj5tl/sample_ranks.csv?dl=0) – note that these data were generated only for this example and are not real data:

This dataset contains 7 variables – 1 respondent ID and 6 variables with ranks on factors considered important in a job: salary, recognition from employer, paid time off, insurance benefits, flexible scheduling, and opportunity to learn. I want to run frequencies for these variables, and turn those frequency tables into a data frame I can use in ggplot2. I’m sure there are much cleaner ways to do this (and please share in the comments!), but here’s one not so pretty way:

rank_chart <- rbind(salary, recognition, PTO, insurance, flexible, learn)rank_chart$Var1 <- as.numeric(rank_chart$Var1)

With my not-so-pretty data wrangling, the chart itself is actually pretty easy:

Based on this chart, we can see the top factor is Salary. Insurance is slightly more important than paid time off, but these are definitely the top 2 and 3 factors. Recognition wasn’t ranked by most people, but those who did considered it their #2 factor; ditto for flexible scheduling at #3. Opportunity to learn didn’t make the top 3 for most respondents.
