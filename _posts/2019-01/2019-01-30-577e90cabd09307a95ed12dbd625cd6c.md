The `seymour`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 Feedly API package has been updated to support subscribing to RSS/Atom feeds. Previously the package was intended to just treat your Feedly as a data source, but there was a compelling use case for enabling subscription support: subscribing to code repository issues. Sure, thereâ€™s already email notice integration for repository issues on most social coding platforms but if you always have Feedly up (like I usually do) having issues aggregated into a Feedly category may be a better way to keep tabs on whatâ€™s going on.

If you use GitLab, that platform already has RSS feeds for public repositories. GitHub users have to use either RSSHub or gh-feed to do the same (note that you can host your own instance of either of those tools).

If you have more than a few repos and want to have their issues shunted to Feedly you *could* go manually enter them into the Feedly UI but that could be a pain, especially if â€œmore than a fewâ€� is in the dozens or hundreds. But, we have R and can automate this. Iâ€™m providing an example for GitHub (since most readers art still stuck on that legacy platform) via the `gh` package but the same methods can be done for GitLab using the `gitlabr`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)

 package.

First, we need to get the list of public GitHub issues you own:

```
library(gh)
library(purrr)
library(seymour) # git.sr.ht/~hrbrmstr/seymour, git[la|hu]b/hrbrmstr/seymour

gh::gh(
 "/user/repos", 
 visibility = "public",
 affiliation = "owner",
 sort = "created", direction = "desc", 
 .token = Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT") # see ?devtools::github_pat
) -> gh_repos

```

If you have more than 30 the `gh` package has a `gh_next()` function which will enable you to paginate through all your repos.

Now you need to choose between gh-feed or RSSHub and prepend a special URL prefix to a `user/repo` string to create a usable RSS URL. These are the prefixes:

Weâ€™ll use RSSHub for the remainder of the example.

Letâ€™s do this first in base R. `feedly_subscribe()` takes an RSS/Atom URL as a parameter and optionally supports supplying a title and a vector of Feedly category names to help organize your new addition. The title will be automagically intuited by Feedly if not supplied. Weâ€™ll iterate over the return value of our call to the GitHub API and add subscribe to each repo.

```
do.call(
 rbind.data.frame,
 lapply(sapply(gh_repos, "[[", "name"), function(.x) {
 feedly_subscribe(
 feed_url = sprintf("https://rsshub.app/github/%s/%s", "hrbrmstr", .x),
 category = "github issues"
 )
 }) 
) -> res

```

The `res` value is a data frame that just has the resultant metadata about feed ids and where theyâ€™re located.

Hereâ€™s the same thing tidyverse-style:

```
map_chr(repos, "name") %>% 
 sprintf("https://rsshub.app/github/%s/%s", "hrbrmstr", .) %>% 
 map_df(feedly_subscribe, category = "github issues") -> res

```

### FIN

There are two other addition to the `seymour` package: `feedly_subscriptions()`. This convenience function just pulls a data frame of feeds you subscribe to. The same data could be retrieved via the existing â€œstreamâ€� functions but this new function is faster and more targeted. The other one is `feedly_categories()` which you can use to identify the categories you have. The same data could be retrieved via the â€œcollectionsâ€� functions, but this function â€” again â€” is faster and more targeted.

As usual, kick the tyres and file issues/PRs as needed.
