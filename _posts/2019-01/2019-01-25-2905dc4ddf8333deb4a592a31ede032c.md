This was my second **RStudio Conference** following last year’s editionin San Diego! In addition, at **Tidyverse Developer Day** I got a reallycool chance to work on issues and contribute to making the Tidyversebetter. This post won’t be a complete overview of the talks at theconference (others have already released some good blog posts on thatnote: Julia Silge,Brooke Watson,ZevRoss,etc.) and will be more of a reflection on how I contributed to theTidyverse at #TidyverseDevDay and how I felt being at the conference.

As usual I collected a bunch of hex stickers at this conference, many ofthem that I already own… I seem to have a weird thing about collectingthem but never using them (from Twitter I can see this isn’t somethingthat’s exclusive to me however). Talking about hex stickers…for**Tidyverse Developer Day** each participant got a shiny Tidyverse hexmedallion!

Too bad it’s not like the Dumbledore’s Army galleon, or Hadley couldjust send a covert message to all the participants, like “TidyDevs,Assemble!” Maybe next year, I suppose.

Anyways, let’s get started!

The day following **RStudio::Conf** those lucky people that got a ticketgathered at the “Sunset Room” to contribute to the Tidyverse. Aftergrabbing a quick coffee and breakfast taco, Hadley made a smallintroduction outlined exactly what and how the day was going to go andthen we all got to work. There was a large list of tagged issues readyfor us but we could also choose our own and ask a RStudio member to tagit as “tidy-dev-day” for us.

After finding an issue I wanted to work on here was my basic workflow:

- Fork the repo of the package I needed to work on.

- Go into RStudio: File > New Project > Version Control >Git > Paste the `.git` link from your forked repository on GitHub(click on the big green “Clone or download” button)

- Once you’ve opened up the project, make sure to create a new branchthrough the Git tab (click on the icon with two purple boxes next tothe gear icon)

- You’re all set to start coding!


There is another way to do most of this through the Git Bash terminal,which you can learn from Tony’s blog posthere.

The main things I focused on were improving documentation and providingadditional examples. For these tasks I found it important to do a lot ofresearch first. Thankfully I was able to find many Stack Overflow postsof people explaining the issues that I wanted to write about as well as#rstats blog posts/tutorials that could provide me with ideas on how tophrase things and write good small examples!

An important thing that I learned was that it’s good practice to createa different branch for working on a Pull Request for different issues onthe same package! When you’re changing documentation in a package it’simportant to make sure you use `roxygen2` package’s `roxygenize()`function to update changes. Don’t forget to run the R CMD Check as well(the “Check” icon in the `Build` tab). After you’re done with all ofthat, it’s time to commit, push, then create a pull request (PR) tomerge your proposed changes with the master branch!

When you write a commit message you can use a hashtag and then number torefer to issues in the Github repo as well as use a number ofkeywordsto close these issues automatically (in our case when the PR is merged).

If you check Github you can see that it automatically prepended the reponame and a link to the issue being referenced.

Then I waited to see if those changes were approved or if there werestill a few things that needed changing:

OK! After reading the comments from Hadley (!) and Lionel (!) I go backinto my branch in RStudio and fix those changes. When I commit and pushto my forked repo again, it is automatically tracked in the PR. Iusually make the comment, “edits to comply with PR review” when pushingagain.

There we go, I have now officially contributed to the Tidyverse!

Another good resource for contributing to open-source is NicCrane’s step-by-step blogpost(she also presented at RStudio::Conf on building a Shiny app for genomicmedicine) and Tony El-Habr’s blogpost alsoon #TidyverseDevDay (whom I actually met at the Sports AnalyticsBirds-of-a-Feather session!).

I felt this was a fantastic opportunity for people of all skill levelsto experience contributing to open source. The RStudio team were veryhelpful buzzing around the event space and for those extremely new toprogramming or git it was a valuable lesson as you were guided along theprocess from start to finish. For myself, I have had previous experiencecontributing to open source packages as well as creating, testing,bug-squishing R packages at my workplace but this was a great way for meto give back to the R community in what little way that I could. Iactually still have a few more issues from **Tidyverse Developer Day**that are a work-in-progress and I hope to continue contributing in thefuture!

To get to Austin I had a long flight in from Japan with a 5 hour layoverin Minneapolis. Bored, I decided to do some#TidyTuesday to passthe time. It turned outalright inthe end but jet lag does not make for very interpretable code… While I’mstill on the topic of #TidyTuesday… apparently, ThomasMock had some TidyTuesday hex stickersbut unfortunately I couldn’t get my hands on them!

Here were some of my highlights from Day One:


Joe Cheng’s keynote on `shinytest`,`cranwhales`, `shinyloadtest`, `rendercachedplot`, and **RStudioConnect** showing how Shiny can be completely used for production.(Slides)


An **awesome** #DataForGood type of presentation by BrookeWatson who talked about using Rto tidy data on families separated at the US border.


Tyler Morgan-Wall on`rayshader`: I’ve been casually keeping up with developments ontwitter but I was still wowed by the presentation, especially 3Dprinting. If I had that kind of tech when I was a kid I would’ve wonALL the science fairs with the most realistic looking baking sodavolcano!


Thomas Pedersen came out withanother `gganimate` presentation showing all the new featuresintroduced since his last `gganimate` talk at UseR 2018. This isdefinitely a talk that you need to watch for all the examples!(Slides)


All in all **Day One** was great but I was still pretty exhausted frommy long trip so I didn’t get to talk to as many people as I liked.

**Day Two** began with a great talk on teaching programming byFelienne, her talk was so good Irealized she didn’t say anything about R until after she finished! Mybiggest take-away from her was “You don’t become an expert by doingexpert things!” which I agreed with as a self-taught R user. For me itwas really about starting with the basics, integrating what I alreadyknew outside of R into what I did with R (ex. bringing my love of soccerinto creating World Cupvisualizations with `ggplot2`and `gganimate`), and incrementally building up my skills throughreading blog posts and tutorials.

One of the most informative talks from my perspective was by JimHester on dependencies. He talked abouthow “not all dependencies are created equal” due to differences betweendependencies in install times, package sizes, and the systemrequirements. He also talked about the “illusionary superiority” problemevery package developer gets in regards to overestimating their ownabilities and underestimating the probability of introducing new bugsfrom adding dependencies. To address these concerns Jim introduced the`itdepends` package which acts as a toolbox for dependencydecision-making. This package allows one to assess usage, measureweights, visualize proportions, and assist in the removal ofdependencies through a series of `dep_*()` functions. As I help developand maintain all the R packages that my NGOuses for data processing/visualization, this talk and package will beextremely useful for me to do some code “auditing” and find ways toreduce technical debt.(Slides)

Several other highlights from **Day Two** were:


Rich Iannone formally introducingthe `gt` package: this looks like a great alternative to using`kable` or `DT` for creating well-formatted tables!(Slides)


Jenny Bryan and LionelHenry both separately presentedon the various use cases and associated challenges of tidyeval.Jenny Bryan::Slides, LionelHenry::Slides


Jesse Sadler talked abouttackling problems dealing with accounting/inheritance data from 16thCentury Europe using R. Along the way he created the `debkeepr`package to help himself analyze non-decimal currencies!(Slides)


On **Day Two** I mustered up the courage and energy to go to twodifferent Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, Public Sector/Government andSports Analytics. At lunch I was able to meet R users from places likethe Federal Reserve and the Federal Aviation Administration. I heardstories on how hard it was to convince people, especially non-technicalhigher-ups, to give them the green light to switch to R as well as morerecent success stories of running workshops and tutorials within theirdepartments. Even though I work for a NGO I felt comfortable talking tothese people and it was a great way to exchange knowledge with people ina somewhat similar industry (especially since I was unable to attend the“Data for Good” Birds-of-a-Feather session). The shadow that hung over alot of the people I met was that they were unable to work due to thegovernment shutdown, I can only hope that the conference provided somegood cheer and that they can get back to work soon.

In the afternoon break was the Sports Analytics Birds-of-a-Feathersession in the main conference lounge area. While I was there I finallygot to meet Mara in-person for thefirst time and I had an enjoyable time talking with her and thesurrounding group of baseball and hockey team analysts on the latesttrends and topics like fantasy sports and analytics in the bettingindustry. Overall these Birds-of-a-Feather groups were a great way tomingle with people in industries you’re interested in but I thought itwas a shame how some were longer/shorter depending on which slot theevent happened in. Understandably it is quite hard to schedule so manydifferent groups equally, but maybe a dedicated “industry” session blockcould be worked in next year?

To wrap the conference up David Robinsongave a great keynote on spending time on contributing to open-source,“public work”. Whether through answering questions on SO or on Twitter,writing up a blog post, to giving a talk at a conference/meetup, Davidtalked about the many ways to contribute to the knowledge pool in notjust R and data science, but also for your respective research domain aswell. His words really resonated with me as he was the one back about ayear-and-a-half ago that gave me confidence to start my own blog andshare my stuff with the #rstats community. Since then I got a job doingR stuff and even gave atalk at theTokyoR meetup last summer! One of mygoals for this year is to try to do a talk in Japanese while a long-termgoal is to present at one of the big R conferences.(Slides)

Throughout the conference I managed about four-five hours of sleep onaverage, which seemed to have been a thing for other people as well:

For me it was mostly jet lag but also I was kept up by looking up allthe cool stuff I learned and how I could apply it at work and for my ownpersonal projects… well, and looking up taco places to eat at on thenext day too!

This conference was the one I talked to people the most up until now asI’ve slowly gained confidence in working in R and being a member of thiscommunity. I was even recognized by some people for my soccer-relatedblog posts, which is a first! I almost feel stupid for being rathertimid in the past and I want to try and be more outgoing in futureconferences (possibly UseR in Toulousethis year)!

For those who missed out, RStudio have uploaded all of the talks here and you can view most of the slidescourtesy of Karl Broman’s RStudio::ConfGithub repo here!

For next year I already grabbed a SuperFan ticket so I hope to see someold faces and new faces next year in San Francisco. It’s going to benice to go back to the Bay!
