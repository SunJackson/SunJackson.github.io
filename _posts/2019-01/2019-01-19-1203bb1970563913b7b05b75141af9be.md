The 4.2.1 release of simmer, the Discrete-Event Simulator for R, is on CRAN with quite interesting new features and fixes. As discussed in the mailing list, there is a way to handle the specific case in which an arrival is rejected because a queue is full:

```
library(simmer)

reject <- trajectory() %>%
 log_("kicked off...")

patient <- trajectory() %>%
 seize("nurse", continue=FALSE, reject=reject) %>%
 log_("nurse seized") %>%
 timeout(5) %>%
 release("nurse") %>%
 log_("nurse released")

env <- simmer() %>%
 add_resource("nurse", 1, 0) %>%
 add_generator("patient", patient, at(0, 1)) %>%
 run()
```

```
## 0: patient0: nurse seized
## 1: patient1: kicked off...
## 5: patient0: nurse released
```

But as Tom Lawton pointed out, until now, there was no way of handling any alternative path for an arrival that was preempted and â€œkicked offâ€� from a resource. This mechanism has been implemented into the new `handle_unfinished()` activity:

```
patient <- trajectory() %>%
 handle_unfinished(reject) %>%
 seize("nurse") %>%
 log_("nurse seized") %>%
 timeout(5) %>%
 release("nurse") %>%
 log_("nurse released")

env <- simmer() %>%
 add_resource("nurse", 1, 0, preemptive=TRUE, queue_size_strict=TRUE) %>%
 add_generator("LowPrio_patient", patient, at(0), priority=0) %>%
 add_generator("HighPrio_patient", patient, at(1), priority=10) %>%
 run()
```

```
## 0: LowPrio_patient0: nurse seized
## 1: HighPrio_patient0: nurse seized
## 1: LowPrio_patient0: kicked off...
## 6: HighPrio_patient0: nurse released
```

Note that such a mechanism is more general, because it also covers the first scenario:

```
env <- simmer() %>%
 add_resource("nurse", 1, 0) %>%
 add_generator("patient", patient, at(0, 1)) %>%
 run()
```

```
## 0: patient0: nurse seized
## 1: patient1: kicked off...
## 5: patient0: nurse released
```

Whenever rejection (or preemption) happens and it is catched by the appropriate handler, the new getter `get_seized()` may be useful to know which resource was abandoned.

Finally, the readership may find interesting the new section about the implementation of state-dependent service rates in the Queueing Systems vignette. See below for a complete list of changes.

### New features:

- New `handle_unfinished()` activity sets a drop-out trajectory for unfinished arrivals, i.e., those dropped from a resource (due to preemption, resource shrinkage or a rejected `seize`) or those that `leave` a trajectory (#178 addressing #177).

- New `release_all()` and `release_selected_all()` activities automatically retrieve the amount of resources seized and release it (#180 addressing #25).

- New `get_seized()` and `get_seized_selected()` getters allow an arrival to retrieve the amount of resources seized (#180 addressing #179).

- New `stop_if()` activity sets a conditional breakpoint (#181 addressing #100).


### Minor changes and fixes:

- Fix performance issues in data sources (#176).

- Update CITATION.

- Fix monitored activity for preempted arrivals (as part of #178).

- Fix seizes/releases with a null amount (as part of #180).

- Rename internal status codes (as part of #181).

- Provide more context on error or warning (as part of #181).

- Extend the `Queueing Systems` vignette with a section about state-dependent service rates.

- Fix performance issues in getters (#183).
