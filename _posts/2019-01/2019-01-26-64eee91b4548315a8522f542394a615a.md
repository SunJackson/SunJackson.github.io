The `ggraph` package provides a ggplot-like grammar for plotting graphs and as such youcan produce very neat network visualizations. But as with ggplot, it takes a while to getused to the grammar. There are already a few amazing Rstudio Addins that assist you with ggplot(for example ggplotAssist andggThemeAssist),but there has not been any equivalent tools for `ggraph`. Till now. This post introduces `snahelper`,an Rstudio Addin which provides a tiny GUI for visualizing and analysing networks.

You can install the developer version with:

```
#install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("schochastics/snahelper")
```

In order to work properly, the Package also needs the `smglr` Package, which adds a newlayout algorithm.

```
devtools::install_github("schochastics/smglr")
```

In order to use the Addin, simply highlight a network in your script and select`snahelper` from the Addin dropdown menu.

The GUI has the following components:

- Create and tweak a layout for your network

- Check and add note attributes

- Create the node styles

- Review edge attributes

- Create the edge styles

- Review Result

- Get the Code


Let’s go through them step-by-step.

## Layout

The layout tab allows you to choose from all implemented algorithms in `igraph` andthe stress based layout from `smglr`, which is the default and recommended choice.See this blog post for anexplanation. In the tweak section you can move individual nodes around. The implementationis still very crude, so don’t expect miracles from that. The layout is saved as node attributesx and y.

## Node Attribute Manager

The Node Attribute Manager shows all existing node attributes in a sortable table.In addition, you can calculate some new ones (centrality and clustering).*NOTE*: the centrality indices only work for undirected and unweighted networks so far.

## Nodes

This is where you can style your nodes. You can either do it manually, by choosing acolor/size for all nodes together, or based on an attribute.

## Edge Attribute Manager

So far, the Edge Attribute Manager only shows existing edge attributes. Future releases mayinclude the possibility to calculate new ones.

## Edges

You can style your edges here. `snahelper` automatically detects if your networkis directed and adds arrows if the network is directed. The other options are similar to the nodes tab.The curvature option allows you to bend edges. I highly suggest, that you only bend youredges if there are two edges running between the same set of nodes to make them visible.If you do not have reciprocal edges, then just leave it at 0.

## Result

The result tab shows the network in its full size. If you are satisfied with the results, hitthe Done button and the R code to produce the plot is automatically inserted in your script.

So far I only incorporated what I consider the bare minimum to produce a goodvisualization of a network. Mostly because I did not want to overload the GUI.If you are missing something essential, open an issueand I will try to add the feature.
