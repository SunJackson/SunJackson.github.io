It was probably not difficult to discern from my previous Drill-themed post that Iâ€™m fairly excited about the Apache Drill 1.15.0 release. Iâ€™ve rounded out most of the existing corners for it in preparation for a long-overdue CRAN update and have been concentrating on two helper features: configuring & launching Drill embedded Docker containers and auto-generation of Drill CTAS queries.

### Drill Docker Goodness

Starting with version 1.14.0, Apache provides Drill Docker images for use in experimenting/testing/building-off-of. They run Drill in single node standalone mode so youâ€™re not going to be running this in â€œproductionâ€� (unless you have light or just personal workloads). Docker is a great way to get to know Drill if you havenâ€™t already played with it since you donâ€™t have do do much except run the Docker image.

Iâ€™ve simplified this even more thanks to @rgfitzjohnâ€™s most excellent `stevedore`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 package which adds a robust R wrapper to the Docker client without relying on any heavy external dependencies such as `reticulate`. The new `drill_up()` function will auto-fetch the latest Drill image and launch a container so you can have a running Drill instance with virtually no effort on your part.

Just running the vanilla image isnâ€™t enough since your goal is likely to do more than work with the built-in `cp` data source. The default container launch scenario also doesnâ€™t hook up any local filesystem paths to the container so you really canâ€™t do much other than `cp`-oriented queries. Rather than make you do all the work of figuring out how to machinate Docker command line arguments and manually configure a workspace that points to a local filesystem area in the Drill web admin GUI the `drill_up()` function provides a `data_dir` argument (that defaults to the `getwd()` where you are in your R session) which will then auto-wire up that path into the container **and** create a `dfs.d` workspace which auto-points to it for you. Hereâ€™s a sample execution:

```
library(sergeant)
library(tidyverse)

dr <- drill_up(data_dir = "~/Data")
## Drill container started. Waiting for the service to become active (this may take up to 30s).
## Drill container ID: f02a11b50e1647e44c4e233799180da3e907c8aa27900f192b5fd72acfa67ec0

```

You can use `dc$stop()` to stop the container or use the printed container id to do it from the command line.

Weâ€™ll use this containerized Drill instance with the next feature but I need to thank @cboettig for the suggestion to make an auto-downloader-runner-thingy before doing that. (Thank you @cboettig!)

### Taking the Tedium out of CTAS

@dseverski, an intrepid R, Drill & `sergeant` user noticed some new package behavior with Drill 1.15.0 that ended up spawning a new feature: automatic generation of Drill CTAS statements.

Prior to 1.14.0 `sergeant` had no way to accurately, precisely tell data types of the columns coming back since the REST API didnâ€™t provide them (as noted in the previous Drill post). Now, it *did* rely on the JSON types to create the initial data frames *but* id also did something **kinda horribad*: it ran `readr::type_convert()` on the result sets ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png?w=456&ssl=1)
. Said operation had the singular benefit of auto-converting CSV/CSVH/TSV/PSV/etc data to something sane without having to worry about writing lengthy CTAS queries (at the expense of potentially confusing everyone, though that didnâ€™t seem to happen).

With 1.15.0, the `readr::type_convert()` crutch is gone, which results in less-than-helpful things like this when you have delimiter-separated values data:

```
# using the Drill container we just started above

write_csv(nycflights13::flights, "~/Data/flights.csvh")

con <- src_drill("localhost")

tbl(con, "dfs.d.`flights.csvh`") %>%

So the package does what it finally should have been doing all along. But, as noted, thatâ€™s not great if you just wanted to quickly work with a directory of CSV files. In theory, youâ€™re supposed to use Drillâ€™s `CREATE TABLE AS` then do a bunch of `CASTS` and `TO_`s to get proper data types. But who has time for that?

David had a *stellar* idea, *might `sergeant` be able to automagically create CTAS statements from a query?*. Yes. Yes it just might be able to do that with the new `ctas_profile()` function.

Letâ€™s pipe the previous `tbl()` into `ctas_profile()` and see what we get:

```
tbl(con, "dfs.d.`flights.csvh`") %>% 
 ctas_profile() %>% 
 cat()

```

```
-- ** Created by ctas_profile() in the R sergeant package, version 0.8.0 **

CREATE TABLE CHANGE____ME AS
SELECT
 CAST(`year` AS DOUBLE) AS `year`,
 CAST(`month` AS DOUBLE) AS `month`,
 CAST(`day` AS DOUBLE) AS `day`,
 CAST(`dep_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `dep_time`,
 CAST(`sched_dep_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `sched_dep_time`,
 CAST(`dep_delay` AS DOUBLE) AS `dep_delay`,
 CAST(`arr_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `arr_time`,
 CAST(`sched_arr_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `sched_arr_time`,
 CAST(`arr_delay` AS DOUBLE) AS `arr_delay`,
 CAST(`carrier` AS VARCHAR) AS `carrier`,
 CAST(`flight` AS DOUBLE) AS `flight`,
 CAST(`tailnum` AS VARCHAR) AS `tailnum`,
 CAST(`origin` AS VARCHAR) AS `origin`,
 CAST(`dest` AS VARCHAR) AS `dest`,
 CAST(`air_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `air_time`,
 CAST(`distance` AS DOUBLE) AS `distance`,
 CAST(`hour` AS DOUBLE) AS `hour`,
 CAST(`minute` AS DOUBLE) AS `minute`,
 TO_TIMESTAMP(`time_hour`, 'FORMATSTRING') AS `time_hour` -- *NOTE* You need to specify the format string. Sample character data is: [2013-01-01T10:00:00Z]. 
FROM (SELECT * FROM dfs.d.`flights.csvh`)


-- TIMESTAMP and/or DATE columns were detected.
Drill's date/time format string reference can be found at:
--
-- 

```

Thereâ€™s a parameter for the new table name which will cause the `CHANGE____ME` to go away and when the function finds `TIMESTAMP` or `DATE` fields it knows to switch to their `TO_` cousins and gives sample data with a reminder that you need to make a format string (Iâ€™ll eventually auto-generate them unless someone PRs it first). And, since nodoby but Java programmers remember Joda format strings (theyâ€™re different than what youâ€™re used to) it provides a handy link to them if it detects the presence of those column types.

Now, we donâ€™t need to actually create a new table (though converting a bunch of CSVs to Parquet is likely a good idea for performance reasons) to use that output. We can pass most of that new query right to `tbl()`:

```
tbl(con, sql("
SELECT
 CAST(`year` AS DOUBLE) AS `year`,
 CAST(`month` AS DOUBLE) AS `month`,
 CAST(`day` AS DOUBLE) AS `day`,
 CAST(`dep_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `dep_time`,
 CAST(`sched_dep_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `sched_dep_time`,
 CAST(`dep_delay` AS DOUBLE) AS `dep_delay`,
 CAST(`arr_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `arr_time`,
 CAST(`sched_arr_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `sched_arr_time`,
 CAST(`arr_delay` AS DOUBLE) AS `arr_delay`,
 CAST(`carrier` AS VARCHAR) AS `carrier`,
 CAST(`flight` AS DOUBLE) AS `flight`,
 CAST(`tailnum` AS VARCHAR) AS `tailnum`,
 CAST(`origin` AS VARCHAR) AS `origin`,
 CAST(`dest` AS VARCHAR) AS `dest`,
 CAST(`air_time` AS DOUBLE) AS `air_time`,
 CAST(`distance` AS DOUBLE) AS `distance`,
 CAST(`hour` AS DOUBLE) AS `hour`,
 CAST(`minute` AS DOUBLE) AS `minute`,
 TO_TIMESTAMP(`time_hour`, 'yyyy-MM-dd''T''HH:mm:ssZ') AS `time_hour` -- [2013-01-01T10:00:00Z].

Ahhhhâ€¦ Useful data types. (And, see what I mean about that daft format string? Also, WP is mangling the format string so add a comment if you need the actual string.)

### FIN

As you can see questions, suggestions (and PRs!) are welcome and heeded on your social-coding platform of choice (though yâ€™all still seem to be stuck on GH ![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f61e.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f61e.png?w=456&ssl=1)
).

NOTE: Iâ€™ll be subbing out most `install_github()` links in READMEs and future blog posts for `install_git()` counterparts pointing to my sr.ht repos (as I co-locate/migrate them there).

You can play with the new 0.8.0 features via `devtools::install_git("https://git.sr.ht/~hrbrmstr/sergeant", ref="0.8.0")`.
