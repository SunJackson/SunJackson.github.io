**Stackelberg GAN** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We study the problem of alleviating the instability issue in the GAN training procedure via new architecture design. The discrepancy between the minimax and maximin objective values could serve as a proxy for the difficulties that the alternating gradient descent encounters in the optimization of GANs. In this work, we give new results on the benefits of multi-generator architecture of GANs. We show that the minimax gap shrinks to $\epsilon$ as the number of generators increases with rate $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$. This improves over the best-known result of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. At the core of our techniques is a novel application of Shapley-Folkman lemma to the generic minimax problem, where in the literature the technique was only known to work when the objective function is restricted to the Lagrangian function of a constraint optimization problem. Our proposed Stackelberg GAN performs well experimentally in both synthetic and real-world datasets, improving Fr\’echet Inception Distance by $14.61\%$ over the previous multi-generator GANs on the benchmark datasets. … 

**Tree-structured Parzen Estimator** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) is a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) approach. SMBO methods sequentially construct models to approximate the performance of hyperparameters based on historical measurements, and then subsequently choose new hyperparameters to test based on this model. … 

**Gamma Divergence** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The gamma-divergence is a generalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the power index gamma. It employs the power transformation of density functions, instead of the logarithmic transformation employed by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. …
