Reticulate made switch between R & Python easy, and doing its best to facilitate both worlds of data science.

Meanwhile, I noticed that most of my followers or students raised the issues of uneasy switch between


exploit the same for setting needed python version or virtual environment:





# python version


Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = “~/python37/python.exe”)


# python virtual environment


Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = “~/envs/stan_env/python.exe”)
