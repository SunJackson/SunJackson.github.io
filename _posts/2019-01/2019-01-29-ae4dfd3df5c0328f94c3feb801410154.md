In 2014, we built a simple Add-on for Google Sheets that allowed its users to leverage our Text Analysis API from their spreadsheets, without having to write any code.

This Add-on allowed our users generate reliable insights from their data in spreadsheet with just one click.

After almost five years of serving a phenomenally diverse group of hackers, analysts, and anyone curious enough to try out Deep Learning-powered NLP on their data, we’ve decided that the Add-on has run its course and we’re going to deprecate it as of this week.

### But wait! It’s still easy to use the Text Analysis API from Google Sheets!﻿

Even though the Add-on won’t be available any longer, you can still make calls to the Text Analysis API from your spreadsheets. You won’t need to start writing code, and analyzing your unstructured data is still just a couple of clicks away!

We’ve written this script to help you start making calls to the Text Analysis API. To try it for yourself, simply paste the script into the *Script Editor* on the *Tools* tab, hit *Save*, and then enter  “=TextAPIResults(A1, “sentiment”)” in the cell where you want your insights to appear. You can then extend that cell to analyze as many cells as you want at once

This code works with all the Text Analysis API’s endpoints, so for example if you want to do more than Sentiment Analysis we’ve also got you covered. To call one of the other endpoints (Classification, Entity Extraction, Summarization etc…) simply change “sentiment” to whichever one you want to use (just make sure the spelling and capitalization is correct!). “A1” in the function refers to the cell, so be sure to identify the right one before you hit enter

So let’s say I want to extarct any entity mentioned in a piece of text I’d run the following function “=TextAPIResults(A1, “entities”)” by adding it to the cell we want the results to appear in. Simple!

**NOTE: once you run this script, be sure to copy & paste the values in the cells, otherwise the script will execute every time you restart your browser.** 

### How much does this new method cost?

Nothing. Nada. Zilch. It’s free of charge.

The Text Analysis API has a Free plan, and free means free (no trial period, no credit card details). You get **30,000 calls per month free of charge** – that’s a lot of enriched content to help you generate insights! Just sign up for the Free plan here, and paste in your credentials where you see the two prompts (“YOUR_APP_ID” and “YOUR_APP_ID“) in the script we just shared with you.

Hit *Sign me up* below to sign up for the Free plan and grab your credentials.

So while it’s true that all good Google Sheets Add-ons come to an end, we’d never leave our users hanging with their unstructured data nightmares. Enjoy digging into your data, and if you have any issues with this new method, be sure to reach out with an email to support@aylien.com or hit us up on Intercom!
