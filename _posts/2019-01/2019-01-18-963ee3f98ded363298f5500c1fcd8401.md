**TLDR**

- Kaggle ended 2018 with 2.5MM members, up from 1.4M at the end of 2017 and 840K when we were acquired in March 2017.

- We had 1.55MM logged-in-users visit Kaggle in 2018, up 73% from 895K in 2017.

- In 2019, we aim to grow the community passed 4MM members.


 

**Kaggle Kernels**

Kaggle Kernels is our hosted data science environment. It allows our users to author, execute, and share code written in Python and R.

Kaggle Kernels entered 2018 as a data science scratchpad. In 2018, we added key pieces of functionality that make it a powerful environment. This includes the ability to use a GPU backend and collaborate with other users.  

We had 346K users author kernels in 2018, up 3.1x from 111K in 2017.

Some of the most upvoted kernels from this year were:

**Datasets**

Kaggle’s datasets platform allows our community to share datasets with each other. We currently have ~14K datasets that have been shared publicly by our community.

We entered the year only supporting public datasets, which limited the use cases for our datasets. In 2018, we added the ability for datasets to be kept private or shared with collaborators. This makes Kaggle a good destination for projects that aren’t intended to be publicly shared. We had 78K private datasets upload in 2018.

We had 11K public datasets uploaded to Kaggle in 2018, up from 3.4K 2017. 731K users downloaded datasets in 2018, up 2.2x from 335K downloaded in 2017.

Some of the most downloaded datasets from this year include:

 

**Competitions**

Machine learning competitions were Kaggle’s first product. Companies and researchers post machine learning problems and our community competes to build the most accurate algorithm.

We launched 52 competitions in 2018, up from 38 in 2017. We had 181K users make submissions, up 48% from 122K in 2017.

One of the most exciting competitions of 2018 was the second round of the $1.15MM Zillow Prize to improve the Zestimate home valuation algorithm.

 

The competitions team focused its product efforts towards support for kernels-only competitions, where users submit code rather than predictions. We launched 8 Kernels-only competitions in 2018. In 2019, we’re aiming to harden kernels-only support and use it for an increasing portion of our competitions, including targeting newer areas of AI such as reinforcement learning and GANs.

Kaggle InClass is a free version of our competitions platform that allows professors to host competitions for their students. In 2018, we hosted competitions for 2,247 classes, up from 1,217 in 2017.

We had 55K students submit to InClass competitions, up 77% from the 31K in 2017.

**Kaggle Learn**

We launched Kaggle Learn in 2018. Kaggle Learn is ultra short-form data science education inside Kaggle Kernels. Kaggle Learn grew from 3 courses at launch to 11 courses by year end. 143K users did the Kaggle Learn exercises in 2018.

 

**Other highlights**

As the amount of content on Kaggle increased dramatically in 2018, we have started putting meaningful emphasis on improving the discoverability of that content. This year, we added notifications, revamped our newsfeed and made improvements to search. Improving discoverability is going to continue to be a big theme in 2019.

We added an API to allow our users to programmatically interact with the major parts of our site.

We hosted our second annual machine learning and data science survey. With 24K responses, it is the world’s largest ML survey. 

 

**Focus for 2019**

In 2019, we will continue to grow the community, with a goal of passing 4MM members. We aim to do this by:

- adding functionality that makes Kaggle Kernels and our datasets platform useful beyond learning and hobby projects; ie for real world problems.

- improve discoverability of the content on Kaggle: we have a huge number of kernels and datasets that users can build off but it’s often hard for our users to find what they’re looking for

- transition competitions to start to run newer competition types (kernels-only, RL and GANs related competitions)

- continue to create Kaggle Learn content to bring new machine learners to Kaggle
