Medium + r-bloggers — How to integrate?
Build up a PHP script that allows you to post your Medium articles on r-bloggers.com. The script filters an RSS feed by item tags.

Motivation
I started my blog about R on Medium. Medium is a wonderful platform with a great user interface. The idea to use it came by reading a blog post from Joe Cheng. After I wrote about two or three articles about **R** I wanted to publish them on r-bloggers.com. r-bloggers.com requires an RSS feed of your blog. This is a simple feature if you are using WordPress or Bloggers. In Medium I noticed my feed contains everything that I’m writing. It also includes short comments of mine (https://medium.com/feed/@zappingseb):

### Motivation


The maintainers of r-bloggers.com did not want such comments inside their website. So I started reading on filtering my articles by certain tags. The only way I found to realize this was inside a PHP script.

### Read RSS to PHP

To read my RSS feed into a PHP variable I used the built-in XML reader:

### Iterate over the RSS file

The next step was to get every single item (blog entry) out of the XML. To start an iteration I first needed to get the items into an array. Therefore I made the XML a book. The documentElement function will create such a book. From this book, I extracted all items inside the channel tag.

To store all filtered items, I created an empty array.

I found a wonderful stackoverflow entry on how to filter keywords from RSS. It provided me with a function to lookup keywords. So I looped over all items of my Medium RSS feed. For each item, I got the categories inside the tag category . Iterating over the categories I checked if the category “r” was inside. If so I set the variable $found to true and stop the iteration on categories. If the $found variable was never set to true, I added the article to the domArray . All items in the domArray must be filtered out.

$categories = $i->getElementsByTagName('category');$found = false;

{% raw %}
}}
{% endraw %}

### Filtering out articles

It took me a while to understand how PHP handles XML files internally. After some time I found out I can just delete all items within one loop. It was not possible to do it in my items loop. So I inserted this loop at the end of my file:

It takes the $channel variable where all items are stored. Afterwards, it deletes the ones that did not contain the keyword r .

### Printing out the feed

A difference between PHP and R is that $channel was a copy by reference from $xml . This means the code did not only change the $channel variable, but also the $xml variable. This is the reason I can immediately write out the $xml variable. This command produces the filtered RSS feed.

### Final learning

For me, it was a hard task to get to r-bloggers.com. I simply had to pull out all my old PHP skills and google a lot. Finally, I made it. I was really happy to see my post. I hope more people can benefit from this blog entry. It would be a pleasure to see more Medium content on r-bloggers.com.

*Dear Reader: It’s always a pleasure to write about my work on **R programming**. I thank you for reading until the end of this article. If you liked the article, you can clap for it on ****Medium ****or star the repository on ****github****.
