**Effect Size** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In statistics, an effect size is a quantitative measure of the strength of a phenomenon. Examples of effect sizes are the correlation between two variables, the regression coefficient, the mean difference, or even the risk with which something happens, such as how many people survive after a heart attack for every one person that does not survive. For each type of effect-size, a larger absolute value always indicates a stronger effect. Effect sizes complement statistical hypothesis testing, and play an important role in statistical power analyses, sample size planning, and in meta-analyses. Especially in meta-analysis, where the purpose is to combine multiple effect-sizes, the standard error of effect-size is of critical importance. The S.E. of effect-size is used to weight effect-sizes when combining studies, so that large studies are considered more important than small studies in the analysis. The S.E. of effect-size is calculated differently for each type of effect-size, but generally only requires knowing the study’s sample size (N), or the number of observations in each group (n’s). Reporting effect sizes is considered good practice when presenting empirical research findings in many fields. The reporting of effect sizes facilitates the interpretation of the substantive, as opposed to the statistical, significance of a research result. Effect sizes are particularly prominent in social and medical research. Relative and absolute measures of effect size convey different information, and can be used complementarily. … 

**Total Distance Multivariance** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We introduce two new measures for the dependence of $n \ge 2$ random variables: `distance multivariance’ and `total distance multivariance’. Both measures are based on the weighted $L^2$-distance of quantities related to the characteristic functions of the underlying random variables. They extend distance covariance (introduced by Szekely, Rizzo and Bakirov) and generalized distance covariance (introduced in part I) from pairs of random variables to $n$-tuplets of random variables. We show that total distance multivariance can be used to detect the independence of $n$ random variables and has a simple finite-sample representation in terms of distance matrices of the sample points, where distance is measured by a continuous negative definite function. Based on our theoretical results, we present a test for independence of multiple random vectors which is consistent against all alternatives. … 

**Data Transfer Project (DTP)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The Data Transfer Project was formed in 2017 to create an open-source, service-to-service data portability platform so that all individuals across the web could easily move their data between online service providers whenever they want. The contributors to the Data Transfer Project believe portability and interoperability are central to innovation. Making it easier for individuals to choose among services facilitates competition, empowers individuals to try new services and enables them to choose the offering that best suits their needs.Data Transfer Project (DTP) is a collaboration of organizations committed to building a common framework with open-source code that can connect any two online service providers, enabling a seamless, direct, user initiated portability of data between the two platforms.The Data Transfer Project uses services´ existing APIs and authorization mechanisms to access data. It then uses service specific adapters to transfer that data into a common format, and then back into the new service´s API. …
