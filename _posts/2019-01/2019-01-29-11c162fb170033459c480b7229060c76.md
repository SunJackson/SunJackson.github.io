|Hi there,Deep Learning model performance is known for scaling well with data size, but training these models can be notoriously time-consuming. As more companies (especially major enterprises) adopt deep learning, the need for using distributed deep learning frameworks becomes more important than ever. |




In this webinar, we’ll share:

- How distributed deep learning works and give you an overview of the different frameworks. 
- How Databricks is making it easy for data scientists to migrate their single-machine workloads to distributed workloads, at all stages of a deep learning project. 
- A demo of distributed deep learning training using our newly released feature, HorovodRunner. 

**Presented by:**
Yifan Cao, Senior Product Manager, Databricks


Date: Tuesday, February 12, 2019
Time: 10am PT
