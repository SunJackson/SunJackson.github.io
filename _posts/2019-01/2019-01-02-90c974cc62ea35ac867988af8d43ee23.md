The recent work of Gatys et al. demonstrated the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in creating artistic fantastic imagery by separating and recombing the image content and style. This process of using CNN to migrate the semantic content of one image to different styles is referred to as Neural Style Transfer. Since then, Neural Style Transfer has become a trending topic both in academic literature and industrial applications. It is receiving increasing attention from computer vision researchers and several methods are proposed to either improve or extend the original neural algorithm proposed by Gatys et al. However, there is no comprehensive survey presenting and summarizing recent Neural Style Transfer literature. This review aims to provide an overview of the current progress towards Neural Style Transfer, as well as discussing its various applications and open problems for future research.
