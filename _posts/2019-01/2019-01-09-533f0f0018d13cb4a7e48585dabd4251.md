Noseman is having a headache and as an old-school hypochondriac he goes to see his doctor. His doctor is quite worried and makes an appointment with a radiologist for Noseman to get a CT scan.

Because Noseman always wants to know how things work he asks the radiologist about the inner workings of a CT scanner.

The basic idea is that X-rays are fired from one side of the scanner to the other. Because different sorts of tissue (like bones, brain cells, cartilage etc.) block different amounts of the X-rays the intensity measured on the other side varies accordingly.

The problem is of course that a single picture cannot give the full details of what is inside the body because it is a combination of different sorts of tissue in the way of the respective X-rays. The solution is to rotate the scanner and combine the different slices. 

How, you ask? Good old linear algebra to the rescue!

We start with the initial position and fire X-rays with an intensity of 30 (just a number for illustrative purposes) through the body:

As can be seen in the picture the upper ray goes through areas 1, 2 and 3 and letâ€™s say that the intensity value of 12 is measured on the other side of the scanner:

or

The rest of the formula is found accordingly:

We then rotate the scanner for the first timeâ€¦

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Slide2-1024x576.png?w=450)


â€¦which gives the following formula:

And a second rotationâ€¦

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Slide3-1024x576.png?w=450)


â€¦yields the following formula:

Now we are combining all three systems of equations:

or written out in full:

Here is the data of the matrix ![](https://i1.wp.com/blog.ephorie.de/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-904c604ed19ade99f48d406bd246f54f_l3.png?resize=15%2C13)

We now have 9 equations with 9 unknown variablesâ€¦ which should easily be solvable by R, which can also depict the solution as a gray-scaled imageâ€¦ the actual CT-scan!

The radiologist looks at the pictureâ€¦ and has good news for Noseman: everything is how it should be! Noseman is relieved and his headache is much better nowâ€¦

Real CT scans make use of the same basic principles (of course with a lot of additional engineering and maths magic ![](https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png?w=456&ssl=1)

Here are real images of CT scans of a human brainâ€¦
