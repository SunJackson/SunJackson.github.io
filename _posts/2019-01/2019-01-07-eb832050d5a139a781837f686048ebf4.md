A maintenance release of RcppStreams arrived on CRAN this afternoon. RcppStreams brings the excellent Streamulus C++ template library for event stream processing to R.

Streamulus, written by Irit Katriel, uses very clever template meta-programming (via Boost Fusion) to implement an embedded *domain-specific event language* created specifically for event stream processing.

This release provides a minor update, motivated by the upcoming BH release 1.69 for which we made a pre-release – and RcppStreams is one of three packages identified by that pre-release as needed minor accomodations for the new Boost release. We also updated packaging to current CRAN standards, but made no other changes.

The NEWS file entries follows below:

> 
Changes in version 0.1.2 (2019-01-05)


Added symbol registration


Converted a few files from CRLF to CR [CRAN checks]


Added a few final newlines [CRAN checks]


Disabled one optional output to enable BH 1.69 builds




Courtesy of CRANberries, there is also a copy of the `DESCRIPTION` file for this initial release. More detailed information is on the RcppStreams page page and of course on the Streamulus page.
