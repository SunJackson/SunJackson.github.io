**Who We Are**

Murmuration seeks meaningfully improved education outcomes for kids by providing information, infrastructure, and support for education-related elections, public advocacy and community building efforts.

One of Murmuration’s key initiatives, m{insights, is a technology product that seeks to aggregate data from a combination of sources such as partner organizations’ member data, publicly available data, consumer data, voter file data, and more. These data are then used to build a variety of models and tools that will position Murmuration’s partner organizations to activate and expand their supporter bases effectively and mobilize them for sustained political change. Murmuration has the unique opportunity to build, with partners, a massive dataset that can leverage creative data science to profoundly change the way that education advocacy efforts and service providers engage their bases.

**About the Position**

We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Data Scientist to join our team. You will be working hand-in-hand with our Director of Analytics to develop highly optimized predictive models from a large volume of regularly updated data and to design experiments to test the effectiveness of various campaign tactics. In addition, you will be a key resource for building out custom analytics to help analyze our partners’ work in the political and advocacy spheres. You will be working in a small but dedicated, detail-oriented team that is committed to our mission. The Murmuration work environment is friendly, driven, and non-corporate but professional.

**The Data Scientist will:**

Create predictive analytics using the latest machine learning algorithms on relatively “big” data (hundreds of features on > 100 million records)
Provide analytic insights for partners throughout the lifecycle of their campaign(s); build, review, and recommend custom models; provide real-time visualizations and analysis of campaign work; and produce post-campaign analytics to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts
Design and implement large-scale randomized controlled trials to gauge the general effectiveness of advocacy and campaign efforts
Produce post-mortem analytics on the advocacy and campaign work being performed in our platform to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts
Conduct various analyses to infer causality from large sets of behavioral data.
Work closely with the data engineering team to analyze and augment our data
Work closely with our business analysts to draft clear and informative data visualizations
Work with our staff and partners to develop practical ways to apply our leading analytics to the real world
Help optimize our analytic work to perform well on large datasets stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Never stop asking questions and always be hunting for the next impactful insight

Murmuration attracts employees with distinctive and diverse backgrounds and accomplishments. Integrity, creativity, flexibility, and drive are key attributes of competitive candidates. The Data and Analytics teams are highly collaborative, friendly and hard-working, and we are looking for a Data Scientist who embodies those values.
