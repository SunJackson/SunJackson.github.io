I usually write around here in french and mainly report on French Hospitals data managment and the statistical tasks they imply. As today’s post is about a new package I have created, I’ll be writing in english. The package is called `stringfix` because it uses infix operators to manipulate character strings.



*This post is an actualisation on December 2018 post.*

In Python, the operator `+` is used to paste two character strings together. For example: `'Hello ' + 'world'` gives `'Hello World'`. For that matter, building sentences with words and arithmetic symbols seems a very nice way to write. In R, the paste function requires parenthesis in order to be computed. Therefore the use of consecutive functions can make it hard to understand.

`+` is a nice operator, and we can use it in R almost as it is used in Python by creating an infix operator.

```
`%+%` <- function(x,y){
 paste0(x, y)
}

```

While a ggplot function has already the same name, it is used to override data in a `ggplot` call and not for pasting character strings, see here. When loading tidyverse, the same ggplot function is called, preventing us from using `paste0’`s `%+%`. Otherwise, you can find a hint of character string pasting in the Advanced R book.

In order to create a toolbox around `paste0`’s `%+%`, I started collecting some other infix functions for character strings manipulation. The main question was: which functions with a right to left call that I use really often could be reordered in a `%>%` code. Here is the little family I have since build on : paste, grepl, substring, count, padding. The goal of this package is to use stringr or base functions in backend as a start for an alternative character string manipulation in R.

This package is still at its early begining (kind of a draft for me!) but I thought some other people would enjoy it and may even wish to contribute.

```
"In a manner of coding, I just want to say..." % % "Nothing."
#>[1] "In a manner of coding, I just want to say... Nothing."

```

### Examples

#### paste

```
'Hello ' %+% 'world'
#> [1] "Hello world"
'Your pastas taste like ' %+% '%>%'
#> [1] "Your pastas taste like %>%"
'coco' %+% 'bolo'
#> [1] "cocobolo"

```

```
'Hello' % % 'world'
#> [1] "Hello world"
'Your pastas taste like' % % '%>%'
#> [1] "Your pastas taste like %>%"
'Hello' %,% 'world...'
#> [1] "Hello, world..."
'Your pastas taste like ' %+% '%>%...' %,% 'or %>>%...'
#> [1] "Your pastas taste like %>%..., or %>>%..."

```

#### grepl

##### Case sensitive

```
'pig' %g% 'The pig is in the cornfield'
#> [1] TRUE
'Pig' %g% 'The pig is in the cornfield'
#> [1] FALSE

```

##### Case insensitive (ignore.case)

```
'pig' %gic% 'The pig is in the cornfield'
'PIG' %gic% 'The PiG is in the cornfield'
#> [1] TRUE

```

#### substring

```
'NFKA008' %s% '1.4'
'NFKA008' %s% .4
#> [1] "NFKA"
'where is' % % ('the pig is in the cornfield' %s% '1.7') %+% '?'
#> [1] "where is the pig?"

```

#### count

```
fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "pineapple")
"a" %count% fruit
#> [1] 1 3 1 1
c("a", "b", "p", "p") %count% fruit
#> [1] 1 1 1 3

```

#### pad, lpad and rpad

```
5 %lpad% '0.5'
5 %lpad% .5
#> [1] "00005"
5 %lpad% '.5'
#> [1] " 5"
5 %lpad% '2.5'
#> [1] "22225"
'é' %lpad% 'é.5'
#> [1] "ééééé"

```

#### names of tibbles : tolower and toupper

I have added two functions that I use really often.

```
library(magrittr)
iris %>% toupper_names %>% head
#> SEPAL.LENGTH SEPAL.WIDTH PETAL.LENGTH PETAL.WIDTH SPECIES
#> 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa
#> 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa
#> 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa
#> 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa
#> 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa
#> 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa

```

Finally, I also wanted to outline that the function from the rmngb package : `%out%` : negation of `%in%` can be very useful to avoid typing `! x %in% y` (you can just type `x %out% y` instead). This is why I have included it in this package !
