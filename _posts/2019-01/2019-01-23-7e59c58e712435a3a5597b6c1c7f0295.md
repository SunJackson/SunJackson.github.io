**Twin Support Vector Machine (TSVM,TWSVM)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM) is an emerging machine learning method suitable for both classification and regression problems. It utilizes the concept of Generalized Eigen-values Proximal Support Vector Machine (GEPSVM) and finds two non-parallel planes for each class by solving a pair of Quadratic Programming Problems. It enhances the computational speed as compared to the traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM). TWSVM was initially constructed to solve binary classification problems; later researchers successfully extended it for multi-class problem domain. TWSVM always gives promising empirical results, due to which it has many attractive features which enhance its applicability. This paper presents the research development of TWSVM in recent years. This study is divided into two main broad categories – variant based and multi-class based TWSVM methods. The paper primarily discusses the basic concept of TWSVM and highlights its applications in recent years. A comparative analysis of various research contributions based on TWSVM is also presented. This is helpful for researchers to effectively utilize the TWSVM as an emergent research methodology and encourage them to work further in the performance enhancement of TWSVM. … 

**Wikipedia2Vec** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present Wikipedia2Vec, an open source tool for learning embeddings of words and entities from Wikipedia. This tool enables users to easily obtain high-quality embeddings of words and entities from a Wikipedia dump with a single command. The learned embeddings can be used as features in downstream natural language processing (NLP) models. The tool can be installed via PyPI. The source code, documentation, and pretrained embeddings for 12 major languages can be obtained at http://wikipedia2vec.github.io. … 

**BlitzWS** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
By reducing optimization to a sequence of smaller subproblems, working set algorithms achieve fast convergence times for many machine learning problems. Despite such performance, working set implementations often resort to heuristics to determine subproblem size, makeup, and stopping criteria. We propose BlitzWS, a working set algorithm with useful theoretical guarantees. Our theory relates subproblem size and stopping criteria to the amount of progress during each iteration. This result motivates strategies for optimizing algorithmic parameters and discarding irrelevant components as BlitzWS progresses toward a solution. BlitzWS applies to many convex problems, including training L1-regularized models and support vector machines. We showcase this versatility with empirical comparisons, which demonstrate BlitzWS is indeed a fast algorithm. …
