## Updates

### Time Travel

RStudio Package Manager automatically tracks every change to your repositories,whether you’re adding new packages to a curated source, syncing the latest datafrom CRAN, or building a new commit of your internal package. These changes areefficiently stored as checkpoints. By default, R users installing packages willget the latest and greatest, but they can also install packages from any pointin the past.

A new calendar on arepository’s setup page can be used to travel backwards in time. If you lastused a project in November, you can install packages as they existed **in yourrepository** from that moment, making it much easier to guarantee your work isreproducible.

 Time travel with a repository calendar

Alternatively, it is also possible to preemptively pin a project to a frozencheckpoint. This can be really useful in cases where you know you’ll always wantthe same set of packages. For example, you can include a reference to acheckpoint inside of a Dockerfile to ensure anytime the Docker image is rebuilt,you’ll get the same packages and versions.

```
RUN Rscript -e 'install.packages(...,
 repos = "https://rpkgs.example.com/cran/128")'

```

### New Storage Options

Version 1.0.4 adds beta support for storing packages on Amazon S3 instead oflocal or shared storage. In addition, we’ve expanded the configurationoptions for administrators to control exactly where and how Package Manager stores packages, data, and metrics.

### Retired Packages

You may be familiar with archived packages – they are older versions of packagesthat are listed at the bottom of a package’s information page.

 Access archived versions

Did you know that CRAN packages can be retired? “Retirement” occurs when everyversion of a package is placed in the archive and no version remains current.Packages can be retired for a variety of reasons: perhaps the maintainer is nolonger fixing breaking changes, or the functionality has been replacedby a new package. While retired packages are typically not used by new projects,it can be useful to see if a package you’re searching for is retired. Librarymanagement tools like `packrat` also make use of retired packages to recreateolder environments. In 1.0.4, retired packages show up in a repository with aspecial page indicating their status.

### Git Source Improvements

RStudio Package Manager makes it easy to share R packages that live inside ofGit, either internal packages or packages from GitHub. This release includes anumber of quality of life improvements:


**Subdirectories** In verison 1.0.4, we’ve added support to build packages that live insub-directories of a Git file system.


**SSH keys** We’ve added support for SSH keys that use a passphrase, andwe’ve significantly improved how SSH keys are used to access Git repos.


**Description Files** Packages built from Git now have the commit SHA includedin their DESCRIPTION file for reference.


## Deprecations, Breaking Changes, and Security Updates


**Breaking Change** Version 1.0.4 introduces an important security enhancement thathelps isolate package builds from the rest of Package Manager. If you are usingpackages from Git **and** running on RedHat/CentOS or inside of a Dockercontainer, you may need to update your configuration. Follow theseinstructionsfor more information.


The use of SSH keys for accessing Git repositories has been improved by addingsupport for passphrases and isolated SSH agents.
