**Deep Interest Evolution Network (DIEN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Click-through rate~(CTR) prediction, whose goal is to estimate the probability of the user clicks, has become one of the core tasks in advertising systems. For CTR prediction model, it is necessary to capture the latent user interest behind the user behavior data. Besides, considering the changing of the external environment and the internal cognition, user interest evolves over time dynamically. There are several CTR prediction methods for interest modeling, while most of them regard the representation of behavior as the interest directly, and lack specially modeling for latent interest behind the concrete behavior. Moreover, few work consider the changing trend of interest. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Deep Interest Evolution Network~(DIEN), for CTR prediction. Specifically, we design interest extractor layer to capture temporal interests from history behavior sequence. At this layer, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise interest extracting at each step. As user interests are diverse, especially in the e-commerce system, we propose interest evolving layer to capture interest evolving process that is relative to the target item. At interest evolving layer, attention mechanism is embedded into the sequential structure novelly, and the effects of relative interests are strengthened during interest evolution. In the experiments on both public and industrial datasets, DIEN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. Notably, DIEN has been deployed in the display advertisement system of Taobao, and obtained 20.7\% improvement on CTR. … 

**Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The deviance information criterion (DIC) is a hierarchical modeling generalization of the AIC (Akaike information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion, also known as the Schwarz criterion). It is particularly useful in Bayesian model selection problems where the posterior distributions of the models have been obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Like AIC and BIC it is an asymptotic approximation as the sample size becomes large. It is only valid when the posterior distribution is approximately multivariate normal. The idea is that models with smaller DIC should be preferred to models with larger DIC. … 

**Cost-Sensitive Dynamic Principal Projection (CS-DPP)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We study multi-label classification (MLC) with three important real-world issues: online updating, label space dimensional reduction (LSDR), and cost-sensitivity. Current MLC algorithms have not been designed to address these three issues simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, cost-sensitive dynamic principal projection (CS-DPP) that resolves all three issues. The foundation of CS-DPP is an online LSDR framework derived from a leading LSDR algorithm. In particular, CS-DPP is equipped with an efficient online dimension reducer motivated by matrix stochastic gradient, and establishes its theoretical backbone when coupled with a carefully-designed online regression learner. In addition, CS-DPP embeds the cost information into label weights to achieve cost-sensitivity along with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results verify that CS-DPP achieves better practical performance than current MLC algorithms across different evaluation criteria, and demonstrate the importance of resolving the three issues simultaneously. …
