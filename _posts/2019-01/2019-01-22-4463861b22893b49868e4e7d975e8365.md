*What is the ratio of the smaller square to the larger square?*

## Solution

We'll define the side of the smaller square as *x*. Through symmetry, there is an equal gap either side, which we'll call *a*. The side of the larger square is, therefore *(x+2a)*.

The yellow line is the radius of the circle, and is also length *(x+2a)*.

Using Pythagoras, we can derive an equation between *x* and *a*:

Using the standard quadratic formula:

The only sensible answer is the positive one.

The side of the smaller square is 3/5ths of the side of the larger square.

The ratio of the areas is:

## Result

*The area of the smaller square is 36% the area of the larger square*.
