**K-Nearest Oracles Borderline Imbalanced (KNORA-BI)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) techniques aim to select locally competent classifiers for the classification of each new test sample. Most DES techniques estimate the competence of classifiers using a given criterion over the region of competence of the test sample (its the nearest neighbors in the validation set). The K-Nearest Oracles Eliminate (KNORA-E) DES selects all classifiers that correctly classify all samples in the region of competence of the test sample, if such classifier exists, otherwise, it removes from the region of competence the sample that is furthest from the test sample, and the process repeats. When the region of competence has samples of different classes, KNORA-E can reduce the region of competence in such a way that only samples of a single class remain in the region of competence, leading to the selection of locally incompetent classifiers that classify all samples in the region of competence as being from the same class. In this paper, we propose two DES techniques: K-Nearest Oracles Borderline (KNORA-B) and K-Nearest Oracles Borderline Imbalanced (KNORA-BI). KNORA-B is a DES technique based on KNORA-E that reduces the region of competence but maintains at least one sample from each class that is in the original region of competence. KNORA-BI is a variation of KNORA-B for imbalance datasets that reduces the region of competence but maintains at least one minority class sample if there is any in the original region of competence. Experiments are conducted comparing the proposed techniques with 19 DES techniques from the literature using 40 datasets. The results show that the proposed techniques achieved interesting results, with KNORA-BI outperforming state-of-art techniques. … 

**ArcGIS** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Esri’s ArcGIS is a geographic information system (GIS) for working with maps and geographic information. It is used for: creating and using maps; compiling geographic data; analyzing mapped information; sharing and discovering geographic information; using maps and geographic information in a range of applications; and managing geographic information in a database. The system provides an infrastructure for making maps and geographic information available throughout an organization, across a community, and openly on the Web. … 

**Predictive State Representation (PSR)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
In computer science, a predictive state representation (PSR) is a way to model a state of controlled dynamical system from a history of actions taken and resulting observations. PSR captures the state of a system as a vector of predictions for future tests (experiments) that can be done on the system. A test is a sequence of action-observation pairs and its prediction is the probability of the test’s observation- sequence happening if the test’s action-sequence were to be executed on the system. One of the advantage of using PSR is that the predictions are directly related to observable quantities. This is in contrast to other models of dynamical systems, such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) where the state of the system is represented as a probability distribution over unobserved nominal states. …
