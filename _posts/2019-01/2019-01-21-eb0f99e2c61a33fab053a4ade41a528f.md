Y’all if I had just one takeaway from R Studio Conference 2019, it’s that we are a friendly and tight knit community! Virtually and in person, we look out for each other. 

This past week, the FOMO was real, both from those unable to attend the conference and those who came. There were so many great sessions and such excellent information floating around that it was hard to keep up. 

In this blog, my focus is to share as much information as possible to help everyone feel included, ready to level up their R skills and engage with the community!

**Tidy Tuesday Screencasts****by****David Robinson****–**Since late 2018, David Robinson has been posting screencasts of his analysis process on the #TidyTuesday datasets. These are an excellent way to learn how others approach a new dataset. They also tend to be a great introduction to new tips, tricks and packages. See more about the Tidy Tuesday program in the “Engage” section below.


**R Packages to Check Out** –  As part of my “We are R Ladies” curation week, I decided to share some of the R packages that I find the most interesting. Check out the twitter moment to see a preview of the packages and links to tutorials or documentation. Message me to add more R packages to this moment.

**Datanauts** – The datanauts program is another excellent way to engage with other data enthusiasts in the R and python community. It is a program which enables the greater data and space enthusiast groups to engage with each other to solve interesting space problems. I had the good fortune to participate in this program in the fall of 2018 and I would highly recommend it! 



## Other RStudio::Conf blogs

The R blogosphere is already a buzz with the amazingness of the 2019 conference. I’ve already seen five blogs up and counting. I’ve linked to the ones I’ve found below, but please feel free to send over any new links!

## Next Year

Next year the conference is in San Francisco on Jan 27-30th, 2020. The first 100 ticket purchasers will get the special price of $450, so sign up now! A hilarious side note is that when the location was announced at the end of R Studio Conf 2019, they accidentally put an image of New York! That’s when the R twitter fans started creating their own version of the twitter fail. Martin Skarzynski captured the whole thing in a twitter moment. Great work Martin!

## Thanks

Thanks for taking the time to read this blog post. I could go on further and on about some of the amazing sessions and packages introduced at the conference, but I already did that throughout the week on the “We Are R Ladies” twitter feed. If you want to learn more about the event, I’d suggest you look at the shared conference content listed at the top, read the other great blogs which I’ve linked to and buy your tickets for next year. Until then, keep learning and engage with the community!
