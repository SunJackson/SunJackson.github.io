A good six months after the previous release, another small feature release of our pinp package for snazzier one or two column Markdown-based pdf vignettes got onto CRAN minutes ago as another `[CRAN-pretest-publish]` release indicating a fully automated process (as can be done for packages free of NOTES, WARNING, ERRORS, and without ‘changes to worse’ in their reverse dependency checks).

One new option was suggested (and implemented) by Ilya Kashnitsky: the bold and small subtitle carrying a default of ‘this version built on …’ with the date is now customisable; motivation was for example stating a post-publication DOI which is indeed useful. In working with DOI I also finally realized that I was blocking displays of DOIs in the references: the PNAS style use `\doi{}` for a footer display (which we use *e.g.* for vignette info) shadowing the use via the `JSS.cls` borrowed from the *Journal of Statistical Software* setup. So we renamed the YAML header option to `doi_footer` for clarity, still support the old entries for backwards compatibility (yes, we care), renamed the macro for this use — and with an assist from LaTeX wizard Achim Zeileis added a new `\doi{}` now displaying DOIs in the references as they should! We also improved some internals as *e.g.* the Travis CI checks but I should blog about that another time, and documented yet more YAML header options in the vignette.

A screenshot of the package vignette can be seen below. Additional screenshots of are at the pinp page.

The NEWS entry for this release follows.

> 
Changes in pinp version 0.0.7 (2019-01-11)


Added some more documentation for different YAML header fields.


A new option has been added for a ‘date_subtitle’ (Ilya Kashnitsky in #64 fixing #63).


‘doi’ YAML option renamed to ‘doi_footer’ to permit DOIs in refs, ‘doi’ header still usable (Dirk in #66 fixing #65).


The ‘doi’ macro was redefined to create a hyperlink.
