As someone who measures all kinds of things on the internet as part of his $DAYJOB, I can say with some authority that huge swaths of organizations are using cloud-services such as Google Apps, Dropbox and Office 365 as part of their business process workflows. For me, one regular component that touches the â€œcloudâ€� is when I have to share R-generated charts with our spiffy production team for use in reports, presentations and other general communications.

These are typically project-based tasks and data science team members typically use git- and AWS-based workflows for gathering data, performing analyses and generating output. While git is great at sharing code and ensuring the historical integrity of our analyses, we donâ€™t expect the production team members to be or become experts in git to use our output. They live in Google Drive and thanks to the `googledrive`![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f517.png?w=456&ssl=1)
 package we can bridge the gap between code and output with just a few lines of R code.

We use â€œR projectsâ€� to organize things and either use spinnable R scripts or R markdown documents inside those projects to gather, clean and analyze data.

For 2019, weâ€™re using new, work-specific R markdown templates that have one new YAML header parameter:

```
params:
 gdrive_folder_url: "https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/SOMEUSELESSHEXSTRING"

```

which just defines the Google Drive folder URL for the final output directory in the ![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2601.png?w=456&ssl=1)
![](https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2601.png?w=456&ssl=1)
.

Next is a new pre-configured `knitr` chunk call at the start of these production chart-generating documents:

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
 message = FALSE,
 warning = FALSE, dev = c("png", "cairo_pdf"),
 echo = FALSE,
 fig.retina = 2,
 fig.width = 10,
 fig.height = 6,
 fig.path = "prod/charts/"
)

```

since production team want PDF so they can work with it in their tools and â€” in our testing â€” `cairo_pdf` produces the best/most consistent output, but PNGs show up better in the composite HTML documents so we use that order deliberately.

The real change is the consistent naming of the `fig.path` directory. By doing this, all we have to do is add a few lines (again, automatically generated) to the bottom of the document to have all the output automagically go to the proper Google Drive folder:

```
# Upload to production ----------------------------------------------------

googledrive::drive_auth()

# locate the folder
gdrive_prod_folder <- googledrive::as_id(params$gdrive_folder_url)

# clean it out
gdrls <- googledrive::drive_ls(gdrive_prod_folder)
if (nrow(gdrls) > 0) {
 dplyr::pull(gdrls, id) %>%
 purrr::walk(~googledrive::drive_rm(googledrive::as_id(.x)))
}

# upload new
list.files(here::here("prod/charts"), recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE) %>%
 purrr::walk(googledrive::drive_upload, path = gdrive_prod_folder)

```

Now, we never have to remember to drag documents into a browser and donâ€™t have to load invasive Google applications onto our systems to ensure the right folks have the right files at the right time. We just have to use the new R markdown document type to generate a starter analysis document with all the necessary boilerplate baked in. Plus, `.httr-oauth` file is automatically ignored in `.gitignore` so thereâ€™s no information leakage to shared git repositories.

### FIN

If you want to experiment with this, you can find a pre-configured template in the `markdowntemplates` package over at sr.ht, GitLab, or GitHub.

If you install the package youâ€™ll be able to select this output type right from the new document dialog:

![](https://i1.wp.com/rud.is/b/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gdrive-auto-upload.png?resize=533%2C472&ssl=1)
![](https://i1.wp.com/rud.is/b/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gdrive-auto-upload.png?resize=533%2C472&ssl=1)


and new template will be ready to go with no copying, cutting or pasting.

Plus, since the Google Drive folder URL is an R markdown parameter, you can also use this in script automation (provided that youâ€™ve wired up oauth correctly for those scripts).
