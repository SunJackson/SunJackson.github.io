I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in the`{tidyverse}` Developer Daythe day after rstudio::conf2019officially wrapped up. One of the objectives of the eventwas to encourageopen-source contributor newbies (like me ğŸ˜„) togain some experience, namely through submittingpull requests to address issues with `{tidyverse}` packages.

Having only ever worked with my own packages/repos before,I found this was to be perfect opportunity to â€œget my feet wetâ€�!

## A â€œMinimalâ€�, Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Process

{% raw %}
To the reader who is interested in nothing else other than theâ€œminimumâ€� set of â€œrequiredâ€� steps of making a pull request ,Iâ€™ve outlined the steps that I took below (with additional commentaryprovided afterwards and/or with footnotes). I use double brackets `{{`/`}}`to indicate names/variables that should be filled in by you for your particularuse case. More specifically,
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
- `{{repo}}` refers to the GitHub repository (duh ğŸ˜›);
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
- `{{user}}` refers to your GitHub username;
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
- `{{owner}}` refers to the owner of the GitHub repo;
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
- `{{branch-name}}` refers to the name that you give your branch for your pull request (double duh ğŸ˜› ğŸ˜›); and
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
- `{{message}}` refers to the commit message that you make with your pull request changes (duh x3 ğŸ˜› ğŸ˜› ğŸ˜›).
{% endraw %}



**Fork the repo on GitHub.**
{% raw %}
At https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}.git (i.e. the repoâ€™s GitHub page),select the â€œForkâ€� button. Wait for GitHub to generate the fork and for your browserto navigate you to https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git(i.e. your copy of the repo on GitHub). 
{% endraw %}


**Prepare your local environment to make the pull request.**
Using the Git Bash terminal,

{% raw %}
1. `git clone https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git`
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
1. `cd {{repo}}`
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}.git` 
{% endraw %}

1. `git pull upstream master --ff-only` 

{% raw %}
1. `git branch {{branch-name}}` 
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
1. `git checkout {{branch-name}}`
{% endraw %}




**Make the changes (locally) for the pull request.**


**Review the changes (locally) and push.**
Using the Git Bash terminal,

1. `git status`

1. `git add .`

{% raw %}
1. `git commit -m "{{message}}"`
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
1. `git push -u origin {{branch-name}}` 
{% endraw %}




**Finalize the pull request on GitHub.**
{% raw %}
At https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git, select the â€œNew pull requestâ€� button,then â€œCreate pull requestâ€� on the subsequent page, and then â€œCreate pull requestâ€�again (on the page that allows you to add comments). 
{% endraw %}


- `git status`

- `git add .`

{% raw %}
- `git commit -m "{{message}}"`
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
- `git push -u origin {{branch-name}}` 
{% endraw %}


There are a couple of extra/alternative things you should consider doingin this process (although these are completely optional).

- After `cd`â€˜ing into the repo, a good â€œsanity checkâ€� to perform is a`git remote -v` to verify that you are on `(master)` branch of the forked repo.You should see the following when running this command.


```
{% raw %}
origin https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git (fetch)
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
origin https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git (push)
{% endraw %}

```

{% raw %}
Then, you could run this command again after the`git remote add upstream https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}.git` commandand verify that you see the following.
{% endraw %}

```
{% raw %}
origin https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git (fetch)
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
origin https://github.com/{{user}}/{{repo}}.git (push)
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
upstream https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}.git (fetch)
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
upstream https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}.git (push)
{% endraw %}

```


Regarding the `git pull upstream --ff-only` step, itâ€™s actuallyâ€œsaferâ€� to break this step up into two: (1) `git fetch upstream`, followed by(2) `git merge upstream/master`.Nonetheless, (I believe that) the `git pull` command shown here *should*achieve the same result.


Following the `git pull upstream --ff-only` step, you might also wantto do a `git push` to **really** ensure that your master branch is â€œinsyncâ€� with the original repo. Nonetheless, this is completely optional,especially if youâ€™re working exclusively on a branch.This is discussed by Jenny Bryan in theâ€œGet upstream changes for a forkâ€� chapterin her *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR* book (which, I should note,I used as a guide throughout this process).


{% raw %}
In the last â€œCreate pull requestâ€� page, where you have the option to write a comment,itâ€™s useful to write something like â€œFixes #{{#}}â€�, where `{{#}}` is the numberof the issue. GitHub has a nice feature that can link the pull request to theissue that it attempts to fix (assuming that the pull request is directed towardsa specific issue).
{% endraw %}


## My Experience

The RStudio staff sort of gave us a head-start by tagging some issuesbeforehand. (Many of thesewere supposed to be relatively straightforward to resolve.)Trying to avoid something too difficult and not wanting to be stuckin â€œindecision purgatoryâ€�, I quickly jumped on one that *seemed* simpleenoughâ€”`{dplyr}`â€™s issue 4071: â€œAdd examples for `cumall()`.Note that I say that it â€œseemed simple enoughâ€�; in reality, it would go on totake a little bit more effort than I had originally imagined it would(which seems to be true of anything in software development ğŸ˜¬).

First, it took me a minute or so to find out where I would need to add the documentationexamples. Normally, assuming one is following theâ€œtypicalâ€� `{devtools}`/`{Roxygen2}` workflow for package documentation,one would add comments in the same file as the functionsthat are being documented. In this case, however, the documentationfor `cumall()` (and also that for thethe `cumany()` and `cummean()` functions, which were also without examples), isgenerated programmatically in `{dplyr}`â€™sRcppExports.R file froma cpp (i.e. C++) fileâ€”window.cpp.

Next was the actual â€œheartâ€� of the processâ€”creating the example(s). As a strongadvocate of the â€œcopy-and-paste-from-StackOverflowâ€� workflow ğŸ˜„ (as wellas the â€œchanging-things-and-seeing-what-worksâ€� workflow), I searched someof the existing examples and found that the â€œrankingâ€� documentation group(in rank.R) provided a goodstarting point. I didnâ€™t take too long to come up with some basicexamples. (See the first commit on my pull request,or, for all of thedetails, the whole history of the request.)Then, after running a `devtools::check()` to regenerate the documentation,rebuild the package (and verify that I didnâ€™t â€œbreakâ€� anything), etc., I submittedthe pull request on GitHub.

I assumed (perhaps naively) that my pull request would be accepted withoutquestion. However, that was without considering the factthat it was going to be reviewed by none other thanHadley Wickham himself.Hadley is certainly a meticulous person, so the changes wouldnot get approved without some level of well-intentioned, critical examination.And, as it turns out, the request was not approved immediately.

Hadley identified some points of improvement and submitted some comments,obligating me to address his feedback.Although failure to gain immediate acceptance for the pull requestmight be discouraging, this was certainly not the case for me (and I hopethat it is not for anyone else, especially first-timers). My mindset was to treatthe feedback as an opportunity for improvement, which Iâ€™m always up for.Moreover, Hadleyâ€™s supportive statements and toneprovided additionalmotivation for me to continue working toward something better. So, eventhough Iâ€™m mostly writing from my own point of view as a first-time pull requestsubmitter, there is a lesson to be learned here for thosereceiving and reviewing pull requests from otherâ€”be supportive! 

After submitting some updates in a second commit to my branch,I received another round of feedback from Hadley.Again, his tone was supportive,so I was more than happy to address his comments in a third commit shortly afterwards.

As it stands todayâ€“a day after I made the initial fork and pullrequestâ€”my pull requesthas an â€œOpenâ€� status. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m optimistic that it willeventually be merged (perhaps with another round or two of feedback and commits).

## Parting Thoughts

To sum up my whole `{tidyverse}` Developer Day experience,Iâ€™m really glad to have gone through the pull request processin a setting with a bunch of experienced people who were ready and willing to help,as well as others who were just as new to the whole thing as me! It reallymade everything less intimidating. And now, after having gained the experience,I wonâ€™t hesitate to continue contributing to open-source projects going forward.

Also, Iâ€™m really happy for the other first-time pull requestsubmitters who were successful in their efforts!






Additional Resources
Finally, as a â€œdisclaimerâ€� of sorts,I should say that Iâ€™m certainly not the first personto write abouthow to make a pull request (and Iâ€™m by no means an expert on the matter).For those looking for good reference material authored by people in the `R`community, Iâ€™d recommend the following resources.
