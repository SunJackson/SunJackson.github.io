Most vignettes are built when a package is built, but there are occasions where you just want to include a pdf. For example when you want to include a paper. Of course there is a package supporting this, but in this post I will show you how to do it yourself with ease.

The idea is very simple: vignettes can be in LaTeX, and it is possible to include pdf documents in LaTeX using the `pdfpages` package. So here’s the step-by-step recipe:

1. If you do not already have it, create the `vignettes` folder in your package directory.

1. Put your static pdf there. Let’s call it `mypaper.pdf` for now.

1. Create a `.Rnw` file with the following content.


```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
%\VignetteIndexEntry{author2019mypaper}

\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=-, fitpaper=true]{mypaper.pdf}
\end{document}

```

That’s it.

**Some notes.**

1. This repo contains an example.

1. The option `fitpaper=true` is necessary because the `Sweave` package that is included when the vignette is built somehow causes the pages to rescale if it is not included.

1. If you post your package to CRAN, `myfile.pdf` will be deleted from the directory so it is not part of a binary download.

1. You can include errata or other notes, for example as follows:


```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
%\VignetteIndexEntry{author2019mypaper}

\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=-, fitpaper=true]{mypaper.pdf}

\newpage{}
\subsection*{Errata}

A few things were borked in the original publication, here
is a list of sto0pid things I did:

\begin{itemize}
\item{fubar 1}
\item{fubar 2}
\end{itemize}

\end{document}

```
