**By Insurance Nexus.** Sponsored Post.

2018 was all about technology pilots that will improve customer experience in the insurance industry. Today, pilots are not enough. To win the customer’s heart, carriers cannot afford to lag behind on customer-focused innovation, they must deliver interactive, personalized on-demand products, communications and experiences throughout the journey.

Whilst there are many barriers to implementing AI effectively to drive results across underwriting, customer service and claims, it is essential for winning and retaining customers in the future.
