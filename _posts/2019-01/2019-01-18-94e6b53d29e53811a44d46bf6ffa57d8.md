**INFODENS** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
The advent of representation learning methods enabled large performance gains on various language tasks, alleviating the need for manual feature engineering. While engineered representations are usually based on some linguistic understanding and are therefore more interpretable, learned representations are harder to interpret. Empirically studying the complementarity of both approaches can provide more linguistic insights that would help reach a better compromise between interpretability and performance. We present INFODENS, a framework for studying learned and engineered representations of text in the context of text classification tasks. It is designed to simplify the tasks of feature engineering as well as provide the groundwork for extracting learned features and combining both approaches. INFODENS is flexible, extensible, with a short learning curve, and is easy to integrate with many of the available and widely used natural language processing tools. … 

**Variational Adaptive Newton (VAN)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
We present the Variational Adaptive Newton (VAN) method which is a black-box optimization method especially suitable for explorative-learning tasks such as active learning and reinforcement learning. Similar to Bayesian methods, VAN estimates a distribution that can be used for exploration, but requires computations that are similar to continuous optimization methods. Our theoretical contribution reveals that VAN is a second-order method that unifies existing methods in distinct fields of continuous optimization, variational inference, and evolution strategies. Our experimental results show that VAN performs well on a wide-variety of learning tasks. This work presents a general-purpose explorative-learning method that has the potential to improve learning in areas such as active learning and reinforcement learning. … 

**Hyperspherical Convolution (SphereConv)** ![](https://analytixon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Convolution as inner product has been the founding basis of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the key to end-to-end visual representation learning. Benefiting from deeper architectures, recent CNNs have demonstrated increasingly strong representation abilities. Despite such improvement, the increased depth and larger parameter space have also led to challenges in properly training a network. In light of such challenges, we propose hyperspherical convolution (SphereConv), a novel learning framework that gives angular representations on hyperspheres. We introduce SphereNet, deep hyperspherical convolution networks that are distinct from conventional inner product based convolutional networks. In particular, SphereNet adopts SphereConv as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by generalized angular softmax loss – a natural loss formulation under SphereConv. We show that SphereNet can effectively encode discriminative representation and alleviate training difficulty, leading to easier optimization, faster convergence and comparable (even better) classification accuracy over convolutional counterparts. We also provide some theoretical insights for the advantages of learning on hyperspheres. In addition, we introduce the learnable SphereConv, i.e., a natural improvement over prefixed SphereConv, and SphereNorm, i.e., hyperspherical learning as a normalization method. Experiments have verified our conclusions. …
