~~~
From August 25, 2017 to today, your total PnL is $2457.01
You've made $1107.29 buying and selling individual equities, received $520.72 in dividends, and $829.0 on options trades
With a starting allocation of $10000, if you had just bought and held QQQ, your PnL would be $1583.7
~~~

```

I wrote a script to generate some key metrics about your Robinhood trades, and it even works with options and dividends! Along the way, it exports a bunch of neat CSVs (and Pandas dataframes if you want) so you can do further analysis on your own, should you desire. Additionally, it provides a "buy-and-hold" comparison, which allows you to see how your account would have performed if you had just sat the money down in QQQ the whole time (eek!).

Below is some information about it (copy-pasted from the Github repo README), and the full code is here.

A Python script to get a look at your trading history from trading options and individual equities on Robinhood: calculate profit/loss, sum dividend payouts and generate buy-and-hold comparison.

##  Features

- *Calculate individual equities' trading pnl, dividends received, options trading pnl*

- *Export CSV files with individual trades and other info*

- *Export pickled dataframes*

- *Specify date range to compare over*

- *Generate buy-and-hold comparison*


##  Download the repo

From the command line:

```
git clone git@github.com:trevorwelch/rh-profit-and-loss.git
cd rh-profit-and-loss

```

##  Run it, run it

Run with defaults (this will process your full account history, starting from your first trade):

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username <username> --password <password>`

For example:

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username 'timmyturtlehands@gmail.com' --password 'LovePizza!11one'`

You'll see output like:

```
From November 4, 2018 to today, your total PnL is $486.45
You've made $390.1 buying and selling individual equities, received $16.35 in dividends, and made $80.0 on options trades
With your starting allocation of $10000, if you had just bought and held QQQ, your PnL would have been $-51.49

```

##  Run it and utilize other features

###  See how your portfolio performed over a specified date range

####  Specify `--start_date` and `--end_date` args

For example:

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username 'timmyturtlehands@gmail.com' --password 'LovePizza!11one' --start_date 'July 1, 2018' --end_date 'August 1, 2018'`

###  Export CSV files for further exploration

####  Use the `--csv` flag

The script can output a number of CSV files:- `pnl_df.csv` shows your profit-and-loss per ticker, and any dividends you've been paid out (dividends are not summed into `net_pnl`)- `divs_raw.csv` is the full data dump of your dividend history (and future dividends)- `orders.csv` contains all of your individual buy and sell orders (including orders that didn't execute)- `options_orders_history_df.csv` contains a simplified record of your options activity

For example:

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username 'timmyturtlehands@gmail.com' --password 'LovePizza!11one' --csv`

###  Export dataframes as pickles for further exploration:

####  Use the `--pickle` flag

Similar exports to the CSV section, but as pickled dataframes which can be loaded directly into pandas for further exploration like so:

```
import pandas as pd
df_pnl = pd.read_pickle('df_pnl')

# Find worst ticker and best ticker, dataframe is already sorted by net_pnl
best_ticker = df_pnl.iloc[0].name
best_ticker_pnl = df_pnl.iloc[0].net_pnl
worst_ticker = df_pnl.iloc[-1].name
worst_ticker_pnl = df_pnl.iloc[-1].net_pnl

print("Your best individual equities trade over this time period was with {}, with ${} in gains".format(best_ticker, best_ticker_pnl))
print("Your worst individual equities trade over this time period was with {}, with ${} in gains".format(worst_ticker, worst_ticker_pnl))

```

For example:

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username 'timmyturtlehands@gmail.com' --password 'LovePizza!11one' --pickle`

###  Input your starting portfolio allocation for an accurate buy-and-hold comparison

####  Specify the `--starting_allocation` arg

How would your portfolio have performed if you had just put that same amount of money into buying the NASDAQ? Input the amount of money you started investing with in Robinhood.

For example:

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username 'timmyturtlehands@gmail.com' --password 'LovePizza!11one' --starting_allocation 5000`

###  Example command with custom options chained together

`python3 get_profit_and_loss.py --username 'timmyturtlehands@gmail.com' --password 'LovePizzaFhdjeiw!22222' --start_date 'July 1, 2018' --end_date 'November 10, 2018' --starting_allocation '5000' --csv`

If the stock isn't sold yet, it uses the last sale price from IEX to calculate your unrealized PnL.


If you haven't closed an option, it will show as a loss for the full value you purchased for. It's a bit too complicated to try to calculate unrealized PnL for options. And anyway, it's a good lesson in the reality of options!


The `symbols_and_instruments_url` is a lookup table that provides RH's internal instrument ids for symbols, and vice versa, which are needed to interact with the API. By saving and updating this pickle, you reduce the amount of requests you make to the RH API.


Special thanks to everyone who maintains the unofficial RH Python library, of which a modified version is included in this repo (https://github.com/Jamonek/Robinhood)


Some of the order history code is borrowed from (https://github.com/rmccorm4/Robinhood-Scraper/blob/master/Robinhood/robinhood_pl.py)


For the buy-and-hold calculation, QQQ historical data is from (https://www.kaggle.com/qks1lver/amex-nyse-nasdaq-stock-histories) and IEX, depending on how far back you're going.
