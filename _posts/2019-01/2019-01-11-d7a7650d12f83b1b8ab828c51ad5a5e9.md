SIAM is delighted to announce a new book series on Data Science. Books in the series will address state-of-the-art research on the mathematical foundations of data science and provide insight into the intuition behind its spectacular success.

Ranging from monographs, in-depth essays on emerging trends, tutorials with a broad reach, interactive notebooks, state-of-the-art surveys, and scholarly research retrospectives to textbooks and educational materials, the books will be suitable for a wide audience (data scientists, computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, engineers, and physical and life scientists), and be relevant to all career levels—students, researchers, practitioners, educators—and all sectors of employment—academia, industry, government, education.

As the Book Series Editor-in-Chief, Ilse C.F. Ipsen, notes:

“There’s a ton of work on data science out there, but people need help finding it, understanding it, making sense of it, and figuring out how to apply it. The goal is to publish state-of-the-art research with exposition tailored to specific groups within the vast data science audience: hands-on textbooks for students, focused monographs for researchers, tutorials for do-it-yourselfers, and state-of-the-art surveys for those just wanting to glimpse the lay of the land.”

SIAM is well-positioned to achieve these goals, according to Ipsen, because “SIAM embraces the wide variety of computational research areas and its members come from diverse employment situations. This makes for a huge pool of authors who have a vast amount of expertise and experience to draw from.”

Please contact Ilse C.F. Ipsen (ipsen@ncsu.edu) or Elizabeth Greenspan (greenspan@siam.org)  to discuss book ideas. Learn more about this emerging area with SIAM’s data science resources, and by getting involved with SIAM Activity Groups  and student chapters. Subscribe to the SIAM newsletter to be kept up-to-date as the series develops. This information is listed on the SI News Blog as well.

Author SIAM:

The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is an international society of more than 14,000 individual members, including applied and computational mathematicians and computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and other scientists. Members are researchers, educators, students, and practitioners from over 100 countries working in industry, government, laboratories, and academia.

Ilse C.F. Ipsen is Professor of Mathematics at North Carolina State University, and a Fellow of both the AAAS and SIAM. Her main areas of research include numerical linear algebra, randomized algorithms, probabilistic numerics, and numerical analysis.
