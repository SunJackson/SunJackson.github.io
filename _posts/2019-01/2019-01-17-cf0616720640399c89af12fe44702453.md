The year 2019 has begun and many people have plans to become a data scientist. That is because data scientist has been ranked as one of the top jobs for the last several years. After learning the necessary skills, preparing and completing the interview can be an intimidating task. That is why interview practice is so important, and **Pramp provides a free online environment for practicing a data science interview.** 

## What is Pramp?

Pramp is a free peer-to-peer matching platform that enables you to practice a technical interview. After**signing up**, here is how the process works:
1. You **schedule**an interview by choosing a date and time for when you would like the interview to occur.
1. You then **prepare**for the interview with the materials Pramp provides. Pramp will supply interview questions and guidelines for being best prepared. 
1. Finally, you **conduct**the interview where you and the other person take turns interviewing each other.
1. If desired, the process can be repeated multiple times.

>  Pramp takes two people preparing for a data science interview and matches them together. 

Being on both sides of the interview is surprisingly very helpful. It allows you to practice your responses, and it allows you to understand what is important to the person asking questions. It is often more about understanding the problem and thinking through a solution, rather than identifying a right or wrong answer. 


As a bit of a bonus, if you enjoyed interviewing with your peer and you’d like to practice with him/her again, Pramp has a feature for that. Who knows, that peer may become a friend or a coworker in the future. 

## Why Practice the Interview?

Even the best data scientists and engineers struggle to pass technical interviews. Let’s face it, technical interviews are challenging and intimidating. For many, the biggest challenge isnâ€™t the coding question, but rather staying focused while solving a problem out loud and under time pressure in front of an interviewer.

Data from over 180,000 interviews scheduled on Pramp has shown that those who completed face-to-face mock interviews performed significantly better than those who just practiced alone. Plus, Pramp users have already found jobs at companies like: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Spotify, and many others.
