Here it is! He’s got the following two documents:

– Tips for Active Learning in the College Setting 

– Tips for Active Learning in Teacher Prep or in the K-12 Setting

This is great stuff (see my earlier review here).

Every mathematician and math teacher in the universe should read this. So, if any of you happen to be well connected to the math world, please pass this along.
