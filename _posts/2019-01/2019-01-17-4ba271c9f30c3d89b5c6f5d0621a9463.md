This long-awaited day has finally come and I'm proud and happy to announce that **The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book** is now available to order on Amazon in a high-quality color paperback edition as well as a Kindle edition.

For the last three months, I worked hard to write a book that will make a difference. I firmly believe that I succeeded. I'm so sure about that because I received dozens of positive feedback. Both from readers who just start in artificial intelligence and from respected industry leaders.

I'm extremely proud that such best-selling AI book authors and talented scientists as **Peter Norvig** and **Aurélien Géron** endorsed my book and wrote the texts for its back cover and that **Gareth James** wrote the Foreword.

Here are several testimonials:

**Peter Norvig**, Research Director at **Google**, co-author of the best-selling textbook **AIMA**: "Burkov has undertaken a very useful but impossibly hard task in reducing all of machine learning to 100 pages. He succeeds well in choosing the topics — both theory and practice — that will be useful to practitioners, and for the reader who understands that this is the first 100 (or actually 150) pages you will read, not the last, provides a solid introduction to the field."

**Aurélien Geron**, Senior AI Engineer, author of a bestseller **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow**: "The breadth of topics the book covers is amazing for just 100 pages (plus few bonus pages!). Burkov doesn't hesitate to go into the math equations: that's one thing that short books usually drop. I really liked how the author explains the core concepts in just a few words. The book can be very useful for newcomers in the field, as well as for old-timers who can gain from such a broad view of the field."

**Karolis Urbonas**, Head of Data Science at **Amazon**: "A great introduction to machine learning from a world-class practitioner.''

**Chao Han**, VP, Head of R&D at **Lucidworks**: "I wish such a book existed when I was a statistics graduate student trying to learn about machine learning.''

**Sujeet Varakhedi**, Head of Engineering at **eBay**: "Andriy's book does a fantastic job of cutting the noise and hitting the tracks and full speed from the first page.''

**Deepak Agarwal**, VP of Artificial Intelligence at **LinkedIn**: "A wonderful book for engineers who want to incorporate ML in their day-to-day work without necessarily spending an enormous amount of time.''
