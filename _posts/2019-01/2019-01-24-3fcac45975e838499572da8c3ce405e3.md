“A product owner has many responsibilities, including being able to push changes to production in time. As it may take time to, for instance, implement sufficient logging and to analyze the results, a product owner may be unwilling to spend sufficient time implementing necessary logging. Without proper logging in place, there will not be sufficient data to make accurate retention predictions. This can result in discussions between data scientists and product owners, that may not only have different goals, but also different mindsets in how decisions should be made.” Anders Arpteg, Björn Brinne, Luka Crnkovic-Friis, Jan Bosch ( 29 October 2018 )
