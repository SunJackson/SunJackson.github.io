When: Wed, Feb 6th, 201910  AM PST, 1 PM EST, 6 PM GMT

Data-driven business is the new norm. With the Information Economy well underway, today’s innovators are cleverly using data to steer every aspect of their business. To navigate that course, organizations need self-service environments that don’t compromise the data governance needed to keep data (and decisions) accurate. This need to maintain a single source of truth that everyone can leverage has lead to innovative new practices in analytics overall.

Join Argyle, in partnership with Looker, in our 2019 CDO Virtual Event: Empowering Business Through Data. During the webinar we’ll discuss:

- The evolution of BI and how new technologies have paved the way for modern data platforms

- Using data to serve the needs of the company across departments while leveraging database technology and the cloud

- Built on today’s technology, tackling innovation and improving self-service and governance

- Over coming business challenges with smarter decision making in data management
