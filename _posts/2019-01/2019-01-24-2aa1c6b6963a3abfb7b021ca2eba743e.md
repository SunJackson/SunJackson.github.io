**No DNN Left Behind: Improving Inference in the Cloud with Multi-Tenancy**

With the rise of machine learning, inference on deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a core building block on the critical path for many cloud applications. Applications today rely on isolated ad-hoc deployments that force users to compromise on consistent latency, elasticity, or cost-efficiency, depending on workload characteristics. We propose to elevate DNN inference to be a first class cloud primitive provided by a shared multi-tenant system, akin to cloud storage, and cloud databases. A shared system enables cost-efficient operation with consistent performance across the full spectrum of workloads. We argue that DNN inference is an ideal candidate for a multi-tenant system because of its narrow and well-defined interface and predictable resource requirements.

**Learning sound representations using trainable COPE feature extractors**

Sound analysis research has mainly been focused on speech and music processing. The deployed methodologies are not suitable for analysis of sounds with varying background noise, in many cases with very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we present a method for the detection of patterns of interest in audio signals. We propose novel trainable feature extractors, which we call COPE (Combination of Peaks of Energy). The structure of a COPE feature extractor is determined using a single prototype sound pattern in an automatic configuration process, which is a type of representation learning. We construct a set of COPE feature extractors, configured on a number of training patterns. Then we take their responses to build feature vectors that we use in combination with a classifier to detect and classify patterns of interest in audio signals. We carried out experiments on four public data sets: MIVIA audio events, MIVIA road events, ESC-10 and TU Dortmund data sets. The results that we achieved (recognition rate equal to 91.71% on the MIVIA audio events, 94% on the MIVIA road events, 81.25% on the ESC-10 and 94.27% on the TU Dortmund) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and are higher than the ones obtained by other existing approaches. The COPE feature extractors have high robustness to variations of SNR. Real-time performance is achieved even when the value of a large number of features is computed.

**Turning Privacy Constraints into Syslog Analysis Advantage**

The mean time between failures (MTBF) of HPC systems is rapidly reducing, and that current failure recovery mechanisms e.g., checkpoint-restart, will no longer be able to recover the systems from failures. Early failure detection is a new class of failure recovery methods that can be beneficial for HPC systems with short MTBF. System logs (syslogs) are invaluable source of information which give us a deep insight about system behavior, and make the early failure detection possible. Beside normal information, syslogs contain sensitive data which might endanger users’ privacy. Even though analyzing various syslogs is necessary for creating a general failure detection/prediction method, privacy concerns discourage system administrators to publish syslogs. Herein, we ensure user privacy via de-identifying syslogs, and then turning the applied constraint for addressing users’ privacy into an advantage for system behavior analysis. Results indicate significant reduction in required storage space and 3 times shorter processing time.

**Deep Neural Network Approximation for Custom Hardware: Where We’ve Been, Where We’re Going**

Deep neural networks have proven to be particularly effective in visual and audio recognition tasks. Existing models tend to be computationally expensive and memory intensive, however, and so methods for hardware-oriented approximation have become a hot topic. Research has shown that custom hardware-based neural network accelerators can surpass their general-purpose processor equivalents in terms of both throughput and energy efficiency. Application-tailored accelerators, when co-designed with approximation-based network training methods, transform large, dense and computationally expensive networks into small, sparse and hardware-efficient alternatives, increasing the feasibility of network deployment. In this article, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of approximation methods for high-performance network inference along with in-depth discussion of their effectiveness for custom hardware implementation. We also include proposals for future research based on a thorough analysis of current trends. This article represents the first survey providing detailed comparisons of custom hardware accelerators featuring approximation for both convolutional and recurrent neural networks, through which we hope to inspire exciting new developments in the field.

**Learning Graph Pooling and Hybrid Convolutional Operations for Text Representations**

With the development of graph convolutional networks (GCN), deep learning methods have started to be used on graph data. In additional to convolutional layers, pooling layers are another important components of deep learning. However, no effective pooling methods have been developed for graphs currently. In this work, we propose the graph pooling (gPool) layer, which employs a trainable projection vector to measure the importance of nodes in graphs. By selecting the k-most important nodes to form the new graph, gPool achieves the same objective as regular max pooling layers operating on images. Another limitation of GCN when used on graph-based text representation tasks is that, GCNs do not consider the order information of nodes in graph. To address this limitation, we propose the hybrid convolutional (hConv) layer that combines GCN and regular convolutional operations. The hConv layer is capable of increasing receptive fields quickly and computing features automatically. Based on the proposed gPool and hConv layers, we develop new deep networks for text categorization tasks. Our results show that the networks based on gPool and hConv layers achieves new state-of-the-art performance as compared to baseline methods.

**Error-Correcting Neural Sequence Prediction**

In this paper we propose a novel neural language modelling (NLM) method based on \textit{error-correcting output codes} (ECOC), abbreviated as ECOC-NLM (error-correcting output codes – neural language modelling). This latent variable based approach provides a principled way to choose a varying amount of latent output codes and avoids exact softmax normalization. Instead of minimizing measures between the predicted probability distribution and true distribution, we use error-correcting codes to represent both predictions and outputs. Secondly, we propose multiple ways to improve accuracy and convergence rates by maximizing the separability between codes that correspond to classes proportional to word embedding similarities. Lastly, we introduce a novel method called \textit{Latent Mixture Sampling}, a technique that is used to mitigate exposure bias and can be integrated into training latent-based neural language models. This involves mixing the latent codes (i.e variables) of past predictions and past targets in one of two ways: (1) according to a predefined sampling schedule or (2) a differentiable sampling procedure whereby the mixing probability is learned throughout training by replacing the greedy argmax operation with a smooth approximation. In evaluating Codeword Mixture Sampling for ECOC-NLM, we also baseline it against CWMS in a closely related Hierarhical Softmax-based NLM.

**DLocRL: A Deep Learning Pipeline for Fine-Grained Location Recognition and Linking in Tweets**

In recent years, with the prevalence of social media and smart devices, people causally reveal their locations such as shops, hotels, and restaurants in their tweets. Recognizing and linking such fine-grained location mentions to well-defined location profiles are beneficial for retrieval and recommendation systems. Prior studies heavily rely on hand-crafted linguistic features. Recently, deep learning has shown its effectiveness in feature representation learning for many NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose DLocRL, a new Deep pipeline for fine-grained Location Recognition and Linking in tweets. DLocRL leverages representation learning, semantic composition, attention and gate mechanisms to exploit semantic context features for location recognition and linking. Furthermore, a novel post-processing strategy, named Geographical Pair Linking, is developed to improve the linking performance. In this way, DLocRL does not require hand-crafted features. The experimental results show the effectiveness of DLocRL on fine-grained location recognition and linking with a real-world Twitter dataset.

**A Short Survey on Probabilistic Reinforcement Learning**

A reinforcement learning agent tries to maximize its cumulative payoff by interacting in an unknown environment. It is important for the agent to explore suboptimal actions as well as to pick actions with highest known rewards. Yet, in sensitive domains, collecting more data with exploration is not always possible, but it is important to find a policy with a certain performance guaranty. In this paper, we present a brief survey of methods available in the literature for balancing exploration-exploitation trade off and computing robust solutions from fixed samples in reinforcement learning.

**Predictive Indexing**

There has been considerable research on automated index tuning in database management systems (DBMSs). But the majority of these solutions tune the index configuration by retrospectively making computationally expensive physical design changes all at once. Such changes degrade the DBMS’s performance during the process, and have reduced utility during subsequent query processing due to the delay between a workload shift and the associated change. A better approach is to generate small changes that tune the physical design over time, forecast the utility of these changes, and apply them ahead of time to maximize their impact. This paper presents predictive indexing that continuously improves a database’s physical design using lightweight physical design changes. It uses a machine learning model to forecast the utility of these changes, and continuously refines the index configuration of the database to handle evolving workloads. We introduce a lightweight hybrid scan operator with which a DBMS can make use of partially-built indexes for query processing. Our evaluation shows that predictive indexing improves the throughput of a DBMS by 3.5–5.2x compared to other state-of-the-art indexing approaches. We demonstrate that predictive indexing works seamlessly with other lightweight automated physical design tuning methods.

**Robust Angular Local Descriptor Learning**

In recent years, the learned local descriptors have outperformed handcrafted ones by a large margin, due to the powerful deep convolutional neural network architectures such as L2-Net [1] and triplet based metric learning [2]. However, there are two problems in the current methods, which hinders the overall performance. Firstly, the widely-used margin loss is sensitive to incorrect correspondences, which are prevalent in the existing local descriptor learning datasets. Second, the L2 distance ignores the fact that the feature vectors have been normalized to unit norm. To tackle these two problems and further boost the performance, we propose a robust angular loss which 1) uses cosine similarity instead of L2 distance to compare descriptors and 2) relies on a robust loss function that gives smaller penalty to triplets with negative relative similarity. The resulting descriptor shows robustness on different datasets, reaching the state-of-the-art result on Brown dataset , as well as demonstrating excellent generalization ability on the Hpatches dataset and a Wide Baseline Stereo dataset.

**Spectral Graph Analysis: A Unified Explanation and Modern Perspectives**

Complex networks or graphs are ubiquitous in sciences and engineering: biological networks, brain networks, transportation networks, social networks, and the World Wide Web, to name a few. Spectral graph theory provides a set of useful techniques and models for understanding `patterns of interconnectedness’ in a graph. Our prime focus in this paper is on the following question: Is there a unified explanation and description of the fundamental spectral graph methods? There are at least two reasons to be interested in this question. Firstly, to gain a much deeper and refined understanding of the basic foundational principles, and secondly, to derive rich consequences with practical significance for algorithm design. However, despite half a century of research, this question remains one of the most formidable open issues, if not the core problem in modern network science. The achievement of this paper is to take a step towards answering this question by discovering a simple, yet universal statistical logic of spectral graph analysis. The prescribed viewpoint appears to be good enough to accommodate almost all existing spectral graph techniques as a consequence of just one single formalism and algorithm.

**Universal Rules for Fooling Deep Neural Networks based Text Classification**

Recently, deep learning based natural language processing techniques are being extensively used to deal with spam mail, censorship evaluation in social networks, among others. However, there is only a couple of works evaluating the vulnerabilities of such deep neural networks. Here, we go beyond attacks to investigate, for the first time, universal rules, i.e., rules that are sample agnostic and therefore could turn any text sample in an adversarial one. In fact, the universal rules do not use any information from the method itself (no information from the method, gradient information or training dataset information is used), making them black-box universal attacks. In other words, the universal rules are sample and method agnostic. By proposing a coevolutionary optimization algorithm we show that it is possible to create universal rules that can automatically craft imperceptible adversarial samples (only less than five perturbations which are close to misspelling are inserted in the text sample). A comparison with a random search algorithm further justifies the strength of the method. Thus, universal rules for fooling networks are here shown to exist. Hopefully, the results from this work will impact the development of yet more sample and model agnostic attacks as well as their defenses, culminating in perhaps a new age for artificial intelligence.
