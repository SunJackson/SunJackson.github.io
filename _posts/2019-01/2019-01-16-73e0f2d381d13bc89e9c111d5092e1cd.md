In this article, you learn how to make Automated Dashboard for Credit Modelling with Decision trees and Random forests in R. First you need to install the `rmarkdown` package into your R library. Assuming that you installed the `rmarkdown`, next you create a new `rmarkdown` script in R. 

After this you type the following code in order to create a dashboard with `rmarkdown` and `flexdashboard`:

The result of the above coding are published with RPubs here.
