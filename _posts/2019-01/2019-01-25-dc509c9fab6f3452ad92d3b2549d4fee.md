Last year we gave you a price break down of some of the most popular R conferences around the globe for 2017. We’re going to do it again for 2018. Remember, you canget up-to-date information on upcoming conferences via our GitHub page.

It’s important to note that these costs are the prices of an industry ticket for the conference *only*. If you caught the tickets on early bird and are an academic/student you could see these prices fall by over 50% in some cases. I’ll also mention extra pricing below.

|------
| rstudio::conf 2019 | 795 | 2 | 398 |
| eRum 2018 | 311 | 3 | 104 |
| WhyR 2018 | 170 | 4 | 42 |
| Earl London 2018 | 1170 | 3 | 390 |
| satRday Amsterdam 2018 | 45 | 1 | 45 |
| New York R | 750 | 2 | 375 |

There’s quite a difference in the price per day. A simple bar plot will highlight this

Now, with add-ons it could have been a whole different story. For example, if you wanted to attend any of the 1 or 2-day workshops for rstudio::conf 2018 before the actual conference, you’re looking at adding an extra overall $995 – 1500. However, conferences like eRum and WhyR have no extra pricing.

Clearly, the cost is only one of many factors used when deciding to attend a conference. Location, networking, date and speakers all play a part. In particular, we are planning on attending the `rstudio::conf` in 2020, even though it’s one of the more expensive events (but it looks fantastic!). In fact, next year the conference is in San Francisco (Jan 27-30th, 2020). The first 100 ticket purchasers will get the special price of $450!
