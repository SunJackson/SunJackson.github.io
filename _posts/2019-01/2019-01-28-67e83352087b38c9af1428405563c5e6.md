How many squares are there on a chess board? Depending upon your interpretation, this can be perceived as a trick question. The answer of 64 squares (8×8), is perfectly valid, but there is also an alternative answer if we count the squares of different sizes, not just the individual squares.

For instance, there is one square of size *8×8* units:

Then there are four squares of size *7×7* units:

And nine squares of size *6×6* units:

I'm sure you've probably seen a pattern by now. As we progressively make the target square smaller by one unit, we can find this a perfect square number of times. There are *2×2* starting positions a *(7×7)* square can start from, there are *3×3* starting positions a *(6×6)* square can start from …

The total number of squares is thus:

There's also a formula for quickly calculating the sum of squares. For a chess board, with n=8, we can see the sum is 204.

## Rectangles

How about the number of rectangles on a chess board? Well, to make a rectangle you need to pick any two of the vertical lines, and any two of the horizontal lines. There are 9*C*2 pairs of horizontal lines you can pick (36 distinct pairs), and the same number of vertical pairs, so the answer is 36×36=1,296.

Here's a table of the the first few square grids, and the number of squares and rectangles:

|Board Size|# Squares|# Rectangles|------
|1×1|1|1|
|2×2|5|9|
|3×3|14|36|
|4×4|30|100|
|5×5|55|225|
|6×6|91|441|
|7×7|140|784|
|8×8|204|1,296|
|9×9|285|2,025|
|10×10|385|3,025|

## 2002 Puzzle

Take an *18×18* grid of squares, and remove two of them so that the resulting figure contains exactly 2002 squares of all different sizes made from the remaining squares.

There's an answer on the internet, but I could not agree with it, so I wrote a bit of code to generate all the answers.

If you want to give it a go yourself, here's an applet below. In this variant, you can also specify different grid sizes and the number of shaded blocks you are allowed to set.
