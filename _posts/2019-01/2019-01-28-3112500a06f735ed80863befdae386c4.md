In this paper, we present our solution for pragmatic analysis of call center conversations in order to provide useful insights for enhancing Call Center Analytics to a level that will enable new metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) beyond the standard approach. These metrics rely on understanding the dynamics of conversations by highlighting the way participants discuss about topics. By doing that we can detect situations that are simply impossible to detect with standard approaches such as controversial topics, customer-oriented behaviors and also predict customer ratings.
