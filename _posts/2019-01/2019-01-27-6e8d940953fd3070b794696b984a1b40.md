“When a new, powerful tool comes along, there’s a tendency to think it can solve more problems than it actually can. Computers have not made offices paperless, for example, and Predator drones haven’t made a significant dent in the annual number of terrorist acts. … While big data tools are, indeed, very powerful, the results they deliver tend to be only as good as the strategy behind their deployment. A closer look at successful big data projects offers clues as to why they are successful … and why others fall short of the mark.” Patrick Marshall ( 08.07.2014 )
