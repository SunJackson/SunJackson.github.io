This chapter focuses on Internet of Things from the nanoscale point of view. The chapter starts with section 1 which provides an introduction of nanothings and nanotechnologies. The nanoscale communication paradigms and the different approaches are discussed for nanodevices development. Nanodevice characteristics are discussed and the architecture of wireless nanodevices are outlined. Section 2 describes Internet of NanoThing(IoNT), its network architecture, and the challenges of nanoscale communication which is essential for enabling IoNT. Section 3 gives some practical applications of IoNT. The internet of Bio-NanoThing (IoBNT) and relevant biomedical applications are discussed. Other Applications such as military, industrial, and environmental applications are also outlined. Internet of NanoThings: Concepts and Applications
