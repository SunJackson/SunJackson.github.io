**Clued Recurrent Attention Model (CRAM)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
To overcome the poor scalability of convolutional neural network, recurrent attention model(RAM) selectively choose what and where to look on the image. By directing recurrent attention model how to look the image, RAM can be even more successful in that the given clue narrow down the scope of the possible focus zone. In this perspective, this work proposes clued recurrent attention model (CRAM) which add clue or constraint on the RAM better problem solving. CRAM follows encoder-decoder framework, encoder utilizes recurrent attention model with spatial transformer network and decoder which varies depending on the task. To ensure the performance, CRAM tackles two computer vision task. One is the image classification task, with clue given as the binary image saliency which indicates the approximate location of object. The other is the inpainting task, with clue given as binary mask which indicates the occluded part. In both tasks, CRAM shows better performance than existing methods showing the successful extension of RAM. … 

**Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success by learning directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs, yet is notorious for the lack of interpretability. Interpretability of the subtasks is critical in hierarchical decision-making as it increases the transparency of black-box-style DRL approach and helps the RL practitioners to understand the high-level behavior of the system better. In this paper, we introduce symbolic planning into DRL and propose a framework of Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning (SDRL) that can handle both high-dimensional sensory inputs and symbolic planning. The task-level interpretability is enabled by relating symbolic actions to options.This framework features a planner — controller — meta-controller architecture, which takes charge of subtask scheduling, data-driven subtask learning, and subtask evaluation, respectively. The three components cross-fertilize each other and eventually converge to an optimal symbolic plan along with the learned subtasks, bringing together the advantages of long-term planning capability with symbolic knowledge and end-to-end reinforcement learning directly from a high-dimensional sensory input. Experimental results validate the interpretability of subtasks, along with improved data efficiency compared with state-of-the-art approaches. … 

**SubMatrix Selection SingularValue Decomposition (SMSSVD)** ![](https://aboutdataanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/google.png?w=529)
High throughput biomedical measurements normally capture multiple overlaid biologically relevant signals and often also signals representing different types of technical artefacts like e.g. batch effects. Signal identification and decomposition are accordingly main objectives in statistical biomedical modeling and data analysis. Existing methods, aimed at signal reconstruction and deconvolution, in general, are either supervised, contain parameters that need to be estimated or present other types of ad hoc features. We here introduce SubMatrix Selection SingularValue Decomposition (SMSSVD), a parameter-free unsupervised signal decomposition and dimension reduction method, designed to reduce noise, adaptively for each low-rank-signal in a given data matrix, and represent the signals in the data in a way that enable unbiased exploratory analysis and reconstruction of multiple overlaid signals, including identifying groups of variables that drive different signals. The Submatrix Selection Singular Value Decomposition (SMSSVD) method produces a denoised signal decomposition from a given data matrix. The SMSSVD method guarantees orthogonality between signal components in a straightforward manner and it is designed to make automation possible. We illustrate SMSSVD by applying it to several real and synthetic datasets and compare its performance to golden standard methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and SPC (Sparse Principal Components, using Lasso constraints). The SMSSVD is computationally efficient and despite being a parameter-free method, in general, outperforms existing statistical learning methods. A Julia implementation of SMSSVD is openly available on GitHub (https://…/SMSSVD.jl ). …
