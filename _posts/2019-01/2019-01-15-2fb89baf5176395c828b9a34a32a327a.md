Last week the R package ruimtehol was released on CRAN (https://github.com/bnosac/ruimtehol) allowing R users to easily build and apply neural embedding models on text data.

It wraps the â€˜StarSpaceâ€™ library ">https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace allowing users to calculate**word, sentence, article, document, webpage, link and entity â€™embeddingsâ€™. By using the â€™embeddingsâ€™, you can perform text based multi-label classification, find similarities between texts and categories, do collaborative-filtering based recommendation as well as content-based recommendation, find out relations between entities, calculate graph â€™embeddingsâ€™ as well as perform semi-supervised learning and multi-task learning on plain text**. The techniques are explained in detail in the paper: â€˜StarSpace: Embed All The Things!â€™ by Wu et al. (2017), available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03856.

You can get started with some common text analytical use cases by using the presentation we have built below. Enjoy!
