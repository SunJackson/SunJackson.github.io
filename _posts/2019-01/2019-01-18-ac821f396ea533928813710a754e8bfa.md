A new RcppArmadillo bugfix release arrived at CRAN today. The version 0.9.200.7.0 is another minor bugfix release, and based on the new Armadillo bugfix release 9.200.7 from earlier this week. I also just uploaded the Debian version, and Uweâ€™s systems have already create the CRAN Windows binary.

Armadillo is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. RcppArmadillo integrates this library with the R environment and languageâ€“and is widely used by (currently) 559 other packages on CRAN.

This release just brings minor upstream bug fixes, see below for details (and we also include the updated entry for the November bugfix release).
