**By Farhad Malik, Editor of FinTechExplained**

It’s very hard to find a succinct article providing an end-to-end guide to implement a machine learning project. We find many informative articles online providing an in-depth coverage of how we need to implement parts of a machine learning/data science project but at times, we just need high level steps offering clear guidance.

When I was new to machine learning and data science, I used to seek articles that clearly outlined the steps stating what I need to do to get my project done.

> This article aims to provide an end-to-end guide for getting a successful machine learning project implemented.

 

### With That In Mind, Let’s Start

 

> *In a nutshell, a machine learning project has three main parts: Data Understanding, Data Gathering & Cleaning, And Finally Model Implementation And Tuning. Usually, Data Understanding, Gathering And Cleaning Takes 60–70% Of The Time. And For That, We Need A Domain Expert.*

### Scenario

 Let’s imagine you are attempting to work on a machine learning project. This article will provide you with the step to step guide on the process that you can follow to implement a successful project.

In the beginning, there are multiple questions arising in our brain

> Data Science Is Trial And Error, It’s Research And Recursive, It’s Practical And Theoretical, It Requires Domain Knowledge, It Boosts Your Strategic Skills, You Learn About Statistics And Master Programming Skills. But Most Importantly, It Teaches You To Remain Patient As You Are Always Close To Finding A Better Answer.

Always analyse your data set and see if you are missing any important information, resolve the problems when you see them but always take a back up and save your work as you might be required to go back to the previous step.

> Machine Learning Is Recursive In Nature

 

### Summary

 I wanted a simple page that listed out the steps which we need to follow to implement a machine learning model. This article aimed to provide an end-to-end guide for getting a successful machine learning project implemented.
