“The mechanical process by which data scientists and citizen data scientists make better use of data and analytics is underpinned by a deeper question about the organization as a whole: Does it have processes for sharing anything? This is not always a given in companies that have grown quickly, have grown through mergers and acquisitions or have begun to shrink. If the culture has never embraced or fostered the notion of transparency and sharing, then whatever process the company may put in place to use software to publish analytical models and the data they harvest is unlikely to succeed.” TIBCO ( 2017 )
